However the film is short. It only just makes the length of a feature film, however there is a 1966 version. This version has 4 more shorts including the ugly duckling, However it is missing the live action sequences but is a longer. The 1966 is available on VHS however so that is a plus.However the films were not designed to be watched as a package film they are shorts, so there is nothing linking them apart from the fact that they won Oscars. On the whole you could probably skip this one if you have watched all the silly symphonies multiple times"
2,tt0029583,1,"Where would the animation world be without the humongous success of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs?  If the movie failed back in 1937, there would be no Disney Company today, no Lion King, and no Disneyland.  Disney's Folly, as critics first called it, would probably have scared any other industry from attempting such an ambitious and innovative project.  Pixar may not have ever had the chance to put out their groundbreaking features, and even the Disney- and fairy tale-bashing Shrek may never have been made if Snow White didn't set the course for the world of the animated feature.There must have been tremendous pressure on everyone involved in the making of Snow White, but they did not disappoint.  The end result includes a timeless story, classic songs, and beautiful imagery that will live on for future generations to enjoy.  In fact, this was only the second movie that captured my nieces' full attention spans (The Lion King being the first).In my opinion, the story was great but not perfect.  It's not as exciting or filled with as much witty remarks as today's animated features, but as soon as the dwarfs are introduced, the movie takes on an endearing lighter side. For the record, my favorite dwarf is Doc, because I can relate to him being a strong leader with some very humanistic follies, such as always getting tongue-tied (I do that myself all too often).  All the songs stand out in their own way.  `Some Day My Prince Will Come' is a classic, fairy-tale ballad.  `Heigh-Ho,' `Dig, Dig, Dig,' and `Whistle While You Work' are great songs to pick up your spirits when you have to go to work, do chores, or do homework.  And my favorite, `The Silly Song,' is just a great, catchy, and funny song.  As for the imagery, it's just breathtaking, especially considering how early it was introduced.  The colors are rich and lively, and the multi-plane camera does add some great depth to the movie.As you can tell, for an animation and Disney fan like myself, Snow White is a perfect milestone in the movie world.  Even compared to the animation and storytelling styles of today, Snow White still stands the test of time. Kudos to everyone involved in this picture as their work will live on forever.My IMDb Rating: 10/10.  My Yahoo! Grade: A+ (Oscar-Worthy)"
3,tt0029583,1,"There isn't much that hasn't already been said about ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"", Walt Disney's first feature length animated film. Suffice it to say that it not only fulfilled the studio's hopes beyond their wildest dreams, it made possible the Disney films that followed it. From the famous Grimm fairy tale about a beautiful princess who flees her jealous stepmother and finds refuge with seven friendly dwarfs, Walt Disney created a cinematic milestone. At the time the film was in production until the day it was released, rival producers were supposedly referring to it as ""Disney's Folly"".Although this myth has been recently debunked in film historian JB. Kaufman's magnificent new book (''The Fairest One Of All:The Making Of Walt Disney's Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs''Weldon Owen/Disney Press, 2012)it's true that only after it's huge success, did fellow movie makers attempt their own full-length cartoon features. Upon it's debut, at Hollywood's Carthay Circle theater, (December 21, 1937)the film was embraced both by critics and audiences, grossing many times it's then record (for an animated film) $1.5 million budget. Eight successful reissues have kept the movie in the public consciousness now for over six decades, during which time the field of animation has grown by leaps and bounds. Still. despite the cinematic advances and the passage of time, ""Snow White"" stands alone. While the classic story is but a framework for the film (a fact which troubled me for years), ""Snow White"" can be fully enjoyed for the pioneer it truly is. Along with a splendid cast of voices headed by Adriana Caselotti (Snow White) Harry Stockwell (father of Guy and Dean, as the Prince) and Lucille La Verne (The Queen), there are songs which can truly be called timeless: ""Whistle While You Work"", ""Heigh Ho"", ""Some Day My Prince Will Come"", etc.). Much time and effort went toward developing the characters of the Seven Dwarfs and giving each a distinct personality (absent in the original story) which went a long way in making audiences care for Snow White's plight. Interestingly enough, although the fairy tale was toned down considerably to make it more ""family friendly"", the overzealous way in which the film makers transformed the Wicked Queen into a hideous hag at the climax was the subject of an incredible amount of controversy at the time. In fact, it was under a partial ban in England which made it off-limits to children under 16 years of age! Nevertheless, it was the recipient of a special Academy Award in 1938.To go on about the impact made by the film would be redundant. It simply must be seen to be appreciated. In 2001, it was released on DVD as the first of Disney's ""Platinum Editions"". And many months before it was in stores, there was great speculation about the content. All the anticipation was justified when the DVD finally arrived. Critics and consumers were overwhelmed (just like the audiences back in 1937) with both the content and the painstaking restoration (beyond that done for it's 50th anniversary reissue) and made it THE DVD for the subsequent holiday season. Without going into detail, it looks as if it were made yesterday, and sounds better than a film of this vintage could ever be expected to. But the streamlining has not diminished it's charm--only accentuated it. And when you think (before you are drawn into the story, and you ARE) that ""Snow White"", unlike today's computer-drawn animated features was entirely done by hand, that makes it even more of a miracle.In one scene, when Snow White is scrubbing the steps of the Castle, and pours water from a bucket on them, the effect is remarkable-and that one, near the beginning, is just one small sample of the film's artistry.Back to the DVD. Instead of listing the already well publicized bonus features, let me say that this ""Platinum Edition"" is like a self-contained history of the film, with hours worth of delights the most astounding being a pieced-together commentary by Walt Disney himself. Out of print for years, it is well worth the effort and expense to find. And although Disney made it a point to announce that they planned to go even further with their subsequent ""Platinum Editions"", they have yet to top this one. And I doubt they ever will. Incidentally, this year marks the film's 75th anniversary, and I can think of no better way to celebrate this movie milestone than picking up Professor Kaufman's beautiful new books The second volume '' Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs:The Art And Creation Of Walt Disney's Classic Animated film''is also published by Weldon Owen/Disney Press.It's a very extensive and fully detailed catalog of the ''Snow White'' exhibition,(currently at the Walt Disney museum in San Francisco,California).Here, the emphasis is more on the beautiful art as well as rough sketches and background paintings. Along with it's companion book ''The Fairest One Of All'' it will educate and enchant anyone who cares about the history of Film, Disney Animation and especially ''Snow White'' They are, without a doubt,the definitive tributes to a Timeless Classic, and together, they make perfect souveniers for both the film's 75th Anniversary and and a once in a lifetime event."
4,tt0032910,1,"There are a hundred great things about ""Pinocchio"".  Pleasure Island, for one.  I'm amazed how quick the Disney artists were to discover that the multiplane camera, as well as providing accurate perspective and spectacular landscape shots, could be used more subtly to suggest sinister murk.  (We get a similar effect in ""Fantasia"" in the first half of ""The Rite of Spring"".)  And Lampwick's transformation into a donkey is a disturbing moment, for many reasons ... today they might have made the mistake of using flashy computer morphing, which would have been a mistake: expert animation and cutting gives us the distinct impression - almost all done with shadows - that there is a donkey BREAKING THROUGH from inside; which, in his case, is metaphorically accurate.  (Probably the reason Pinocchio survives us that he is as free from native vice as from native virtue.  He must LEARN to adopt the mind-set of Pleasure Island.  This takes time: time enough for him to escape.)But there's much, much more: clever use of songs (note the obvious, but none the less effective, irony of ""I've Got No Strings""); daring use of stark WHITE backgrounds as well dense crowded ones; an intelligent, mythic story; a wonderful dash of humanity in the form of a cricket; a good musical score; rich atmosphere.  The last is hard to describe.  Of all Disney's films this one has the most pronounced Old World feeling, yet it doesn't seem to take place anywhere in particular - not even in Italy.  Nor does it seem to take place in any particular era.  I fear that no modern film could be so imprecisely evocative; the artistic innocence in which ""Pinocchio"" was forged may be lost forever."
5,tt0032910,8,"When I - and I assume, most people - think of Pinocchio, we think of his nose growing longer when he tells a lie. Yet, that is only one scene in this movie - the first one ever done on this famous fictional character, I believe.This is strictly a fantasy-adventure story, not a parable or a full story about lying, although that obviously is one of the messages. There are several moral messages in here, so it's a worthwhile story for kids to see.Sometimes I think these totally-innocent first few Disney efforts (Bambi, Fantasia) are still better than all the stuff they have put out since.The colorful scenes are another attraction. particularly in the beginning in the old man's house with all the fancy clocks and toys. That part is better than much of the adventure story, as it turns out. The story lags a bit in the middle and then picks up with a rousing finish with a big whale. Overall, I enjoyed ""Jiminy Cricket"" the best and also appreciated that they didn't overdo the songs in here: short and sweet, and not that many. They don't make 'em (normally) like they used to!!"
6,tt0032910,1,"Last night I watched Pinocchio, Disney's second feature-length film and in my opinion one of the studio's best features. Based on the 19th century book by Carlo Collodi, but not half as unpleasant, Pinocchio combines winning animation with great humor and excitement. There are songs, but they're never like the huge production numbers that last four minutes and feature the voice of some up-and-coming princess of pop (who'll be gone in a year) that the studio later adopted with the applicable exception of When you Wish Upon a Star. My favorite song is ""Little Wooden Head"" which is featured in the beginning and is a truly wonderful scene as Gepetto and Figaro play happily with the new puppet.The movie takes a sadistic, cruel, heartless little wooden boy (Collodi's character) and turns him into an interesting, 3-dimensional kid with a good heart but who is weak-willed and doesn't always listen to reason. The animation makes brilliant use of the multiplane camera, featuring a sprawling opening sequence in which the viewer practically sees the entire village at night. The characters are colorful and fun (I especially love Honest John Foulfellow and his sidekick Gideon) and the story has never a dull moment. This film is a reminder of the sort of efforts Disney put int o their films; the man himself had a great storytelling passion that was lost in later works (Alice in Wonderland, 101 Dalmatians). Pinocchio was never as famous as some of the others, and this is unfortunate because it is his masterpiece."
7,tt0032910,1,"This is absolutely, without a doubt one of the best movies ever made. Keep in mind, this movie is only the second feature length animated movie. This is Walt Disney's masterpiece. It's filled with vibrancy and charm. It goes to dark places, and takes so many risks. For me though, every single one of them pay off. Pinocchio is so gullible and charming, and Jiminy Cricket is one of the best mentor characters ever put to film. I love this movie, because I actually care about these characters. They're written in a way that is unbelievably amazing, the script is phenomenal, and the incredible performances, help too. The musical numbers are fun and beautiful. This movie can shift emotions so easily, it goes from heartwarming, to heartbreaking. I remember as a young kid, I really didn't like this movie. It wasn't until I was age thirteen, that I recognized how beautiful this movie was. Everything about this movie is outstanding. If I were to recommend only five films, this would be one of them. Sheer cinematic bliss."
8,tt0032455,1,"There cannot be one verdict on ""Fantasia"".  There must be eight: one for each of the seven segments, and an eighth for the film as a whole - for, varied though the seven segments are, they undeniably belong together. And, alas, space does not permit me to lay out all eight verdicts.  I shall have to confine myself to details representative of the whole.  At any rate, I shall try.We learn the modus operandi of ""Fantasia"", the linking theme, in the second segment - an abridged version of Tchaikovsky's ""Nutcracker"" suite. (Missing are the overture and the march.)  Tchaikovsky's ballet involves anthropomorphising inanimate things, plus the odd tiny animal.  So does Disney's ""Nutcracker"".  But Disney has thrown out the particular details. The Chinese Dance is danced by mushrooms (who look, but are not, Chinese); the Arabian Dance by ""Arabian"" goldfish; the Russian dance by ""Russian"" thistles and orchids.  Sometimes it goes further: ""Waltz of the Flowers"" shows two entire changes of seasons, with leaves, fairies, seed pods, seeds, snowflakes - everything but flowers.  But in ignoring the letter of the instructions Disney is perfectly true to the spirit.  Indeed he is more true to the spirit than the original ballet - for, let's face it: stage ballet is a degenerate and over-formalised art, which makes some of the world's most exciting music dull as wallpaper.  Disney's amazing images express Tchaikovsky's sense of motion more than earthbound dancers ever could. This, one feels, is the kind of thing ballet music was TRULY designed for. The same goes to a lesser extent for the other two pieces of ballet music on the program.This basic device - ignoring explicit instructions, but remaining true to the spirit - is carried through into every segment.  (Some segments are better than others, but none can be called a failure.)  Dukas's ""The Sorcerer's Apprentice"" has been turned into a Mickey Mouse cartoon - but it's the best Mickey Mouse cartoon ever made; and we realise that the story of the Sorcerer's Apprentice is really the archetype that all of the best Mickey Mouse cartoons had been  reaching towards, all along.  The Pastoral Symphony adheres to Beethoven's program but moves everything from the woods of Central Europe to a dreamland from classical mythology.  (The second movement - the section with the courting centaurs - is a failure.  For once the spirit as well as the letter of Beethoven is ignored.  Unfortunately some critics cannot see beyond this movement to the superb interpretations that flank it on either side.)I doubt that so much genuine creative work has gone into a film, before or since - even if you don't count the contributions made by the composers. What's my favourite film?  I really don't know.  But if you tell me that I must sit in a large dark cinema for two hours; and ask me what I would like to occupy my eyes and ears over those two hours, I would answer, without hesitation, Fantasia."

Robert Benchley gives a colorful ""performance"" as a guest of Walt's (who makes a cameo), meeting animators and storyboard-editors while pitching the movie idea of a shy dragon. This picture, more a playful stunt than a memorable entry in the Disney canon, features some gorgeous animation and a lovely switch from black-and-white to color early on.

How it squeaks by with a mere 7.4 voter average while all sorts of contemporary crap does far better is a mystery and a tribute to the downward spiral in cinematic taste. DUMBO is my favorite of all the classic Disney films (a group which ends with JUNGLE BOOK, completed after Walt's death). Nothing since then has been able to recapture the magic. Walt may have been, according to some people, a fascist and an anti-Semite, but he was also a genius.Things that make this movie great: The animation (I used to work at a zoo, and while the real elephants did little talking or singing the animators captured their body language incredibly well.)""Pink Elephants on Parade"".Effective but not over-the-top heartstring tugging.The musical crow number (""When I See an Elephant Fly""). I'm disappointed to discover the voice actors (Including Cliff Edwards, ""Ukelele Ike"" and the voice of Jiminy Cricket) were white guys playing black --- I was hoping they were some cool unknown black combo --- but it's a terrific number anyway.The 64 minute running time.

13,tt0033563,1,"Disney had spent vastly more money than he'd planned on ""Pinnochio"" and ""Fantasia"", and got little of it back.  ""Dumbo"", next off the rank, was made cheaply, quickly, without fuss.  The result is simple but handsome. However handsome ""Dumbo"" looks, the animation is not very detailed, character design is hardly adventurous, the colours are few but bright, and in an hour it's over.  It needn't be more than this, though: the story is far from complicated.  It is, I'll admit, a story that has made me cry more than once; and in this instance I don't feel that I've been cheated into crying, because there really is something poignant and heartbreaking about this ugly duckling variant.Like Hans Andersen, Disney has to pad the outfit a bit to make it fill the space available; yet, with the exception of the introductory bit with the storks, it doesn't feel like padding.  In fact the most gratuitous piece of padding is the most necessary.  I refer to the pink elephants sequence: a masterpiece of extended unreality (caused by such a tiny quantity of champagne!) which dazzles and sizzles and all but soars out of the screen. It's the sting in Dumbo's tail, and nothing produced since can match its verve."
14,tt0033563,8,"Grimm's tale of the ugly duckling is brought to the screen by an animated baby pachyderm whose large ears make him the butt of the jokes of all the other circus elephants. But Dumbo who is accurately named because he utters not a word, makes believers of everybody. More than in most of his animated features, Walt Disney had a sharp eye for satire in this film. Note how the gossipy female elephants do harm to the young Dumbo's psyche with their wagging tongues. His only friend turns out to be mouse with voice by street wise Edward Brophy, who does a great job in vocalizing the street kid who learns to take life on the chin and as it comes.The crows here have come in for criticism by some who have said Disney was being racist in his characterization. My guess is because Cliff Edwards, a white man, was giving voice to the head crow. That's a pity because Edwards does a fine job giving voice to the best song from the score, When I See An Elephant Fly. It never reached the heights of When You Wish Upon A Star which Edwards introduced as Jiminy Cricket in Pinocchio, but it sold a platter or two back in the day. I have a nice version of it sung by Jane Froman on an LP vinyl record.It was in its music that Dumbo scored his greatest success. The lullaby that Mrs. Jumbo sings to baby Dumbo, Baby Mine, got an Oscar nomination for Best Song. Frank Churchill and Oliver Wallace's music got the film an Academy Award for best musical score. Personally I think When I See An Elephant Fly has had more staying power.But Dumbo itself has great staying power. It's a feel good film for kids of all ages and a testimony to those folks who never give up and make lemonade when life hands them a lemon."
85,tt0046183,1,"Peter Pan is one of my all time favorite animated films, this is just such a great classic that doesn't get enough notice. This is one of those movies that is so memorable and I'm surprised that honestly this movie isn't in the top 250. Captain Hook is one of my favorite Disney villains if not my number one, he's just plain hilarious and great entertainment. It's odd that I voted more for him and his pirates, just that they seemed like they were the group that you would invite to a party. Watching this movie for so many years, since I was a child, the story still hasn't lost it's touch. It's such a wonderful movie that not only the family could get into, but even I'll just watch it on my own if I want a cute movie. This is one of the best Disney movies of all time and the story of Peter Pan is told so wonderful you can't help but fall in love with it as well.In London, George and Mary Darling's preparations to attend a party are disrupted by the antics of the boys John and Michael, acting out a story about Peter Pan and the pirates, told to them by their older sister Wendy. The father angrily declares that Wendy has gotten too old to continue staying in the nursery with them, and it's time for her to grow up. That night they are visited in the nursery by a pixie named Tinker Bell and cocky Peter Pan, who teaches them to fly and takes them with him to the island of Never Land. A ship of pirates is anchored off Never Land, commanded by Captain Hook with his sidekick Mr Smee. Hook boldly plots to take revenge upon Peter Pan for cutting off his hand, but he trembles when the crocodile that ate it arrives. The crew's restlessness is interrupted by the arrival of Peter and the Darlings. The children easily evade them, and despite a trick by jealous Tinker Bell to have Wendy killed, they meet up with the Lost Boys, six lads in animal-costume pajamas who look to Peter as their leader. John and Michael set off with the Lost Boys to find the island's Indians, who instead capture them, believing them responsible for taking the chief's daughter Tiger Lily. Meanwhile, Peter takes Wendy to see the mermaids, where they see that Hook and Smee have captured Tiger Lily, to coerce her into revealing Peter's hideout. Peter and Wendy free her, and Peter is honored by the tribe. Hook then plots to take advantage of Tink's jealousy of Wendy, tricking her into revealing the location of Peter's lair. The pirates lie in wait and capture the Lost Boys and the Darlings as they exit, leaving behind a time bomb to kill Peter. I'm always going to love Peter Pan, my sister and I still have so much fun with this movie, we constantly rehearse the scene of George, the father, screaming about how the family loves the dog more than him, it's a great scene. But still one scene that always gets me rolling on the floor laughing is when Peter Pan tells Captain Hook to scream in front of his crew and Peter's lost boys that he's a codfish, and you see everyone just cheer and make fun of Captain Hook as well as that blasted crocodile that won't leave him alone. This is such a great movie, if you haven't seen it, I highly recommend it, it's a fun film to watch and will always hold a great place in my heart. 10/10"

It's OK that the animation and special effects didn't take precedence over the actual story or characters and they didn't try to build an entire movie around a breakthrough in visual effects (I'm talking to you, ""Happy Feet"").I've watched Dumbo with my 2- and 4-year-olds and they like it just as much (or more) as any new release. I think it's fascinating that the bulk of the story is told through music and the sweet body language of the baby and his mother. Of course there's some important exposition that has to be given by Timothy or the gossipy elephants but overall, the most powerful scenes are when no one says a word.

All kids' flicks now are awful. I revisited Dumbo, by the way, on the same night that I first watched Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, destined to be one of the most successful films of all time. It is execrable, and it is simply pathetic how bad films like it are nowadays. I say, bring your kids back to Dumbo, Pinnochio, Bambi, and the like. They may not be as harmless as the kind of movie Disney and others shove out today. You shouldn't be afraid of your children showing emotion. I can remember more than anything being profoundly affected by the ""Baby Mine"" number from Dumbo, where he visits his imprisoned mother. Films like these will mould your children's emotional stability instead of keeping them at a safe distance and selling them toys."

The main character Dumbo,does not speak a single word and even this way, you can know all the feelings he is passing through. The illustrators did a great job showing all animal's emotions in this way.A funny thing is that since I was a kid, I always found the scenes were the pink elephants were shown a little bit of creepy.

It starts, tells it's simple story, then knows when the hell to get off the stage. I wish more film makers had that ability."
22,tt0033563,1,"One of Disney's best known and loved films. About a baby elephant born in the tough world of the circus who is ridiculed and shut out because of his large ears. Comforted by his mother until she attacks a trainer and is penned up in a jaillike wagon, Dumbo eventually learns that he can fly and becomes a star. A great film that deals with discrimination, self esteem, the importance of family and friendship. Features a great score which it won an oscar for and a nomination for song, the beautiful ""Baby Mine"" . The pink elephants scene is a classic. Wonderfully done, arguably Disney's best on a scale of one to ten...10"
86,tt0046183,9,"Another Disney masterpiece. Excellent storyline, thrilling action, absolutely delightful, and the tune you can fly will bring a tear to your eye, but maybe the last part's just me. The only problem is, this is a Disney movie where some real sexist comments and stereotypes come out. However, it's an old movie, and people had a different way of thinking in 1953 than they do today. Overall, an absolute delight to watch, and a must see Disney classic!"
23,tt0033563,1,"Disney had spent vastly more money than he'd planned on ""Pinnochio"" and ""Fantasia"", and got little of it back.  ""Dumbo"", next off the rank, was made cheaply, quickly, without fuss.  The result is simple but handsome. However handsome ""Dumbo"" looks, the animation is not very detailed, character design is hardly adventurous, the colours are few but bright, and in an hour it's over.  It needn't be more than this, though: the story is far from complicated.  It is, I'll admit, a story that has made me cry more than once; and in this instance I don't feel that I've been cheated into crying, because there really is something poignant and heartbreaking about this ugly duckling variant.Like Hans Andersen, Disney has to pad the outfit a bit to make it fill the space available; yet, with the exception of the introductory bit with the storks, it doesn't feel like padding.  In fact the most gratuitous piece of padding is the most necessary.  I refer to the pink elephants sequence: a masterpiece of extended unreality (caused by such a tiny quantity of champagne!) which dazzles and sizzles and all but soars out of the screen. It's the sting in Dumbo's tail, and nothing produced since can match its verve."
24,tt0033563,8,"Grimm's tale of the ugly duckling is brought to the screen by an animated baby pachyderm whose large ears make him the butt of the jokes of all the other circus elephants. But Dumbo who is accurately named because he utters not a word, makes believers of everybody. More than in most of his animated features, Walt Disney had a sharp eye for satire in this film. Note how the gossipy female elephants do harm to the young Dumbo's psyche with their wagging tongues. His only friend turns out to be mouse with voice by street wise Edward Brophy, who does a great job in vocalizing the street kid who learns to take life on the chin and as it comes.The crows here have come in for criticism by some who have said Disney was being racist in his characterization. My guess is because Cliff Edwards, a white man, was giving voice to the head crow. That's a pity because Edwards does a fine job giving voice to the best song from the score, When I See An Elephant Fly. It never reached the heights of When You Wish Upon A Star which Edwards introduced as Jiminy Cricket in Pinocchio, but it sold a platter or two back in the day. I have a nice version of it sung by Jane Froman on an LP vinyl record.It was in its music that Dumbo scored his greatest success. The lullaby that Mrs. Jumbo sings to baby Dumbo, Baby Mine, got an Oscar nomination for Best Song. Frank Churchill and Oliver Wallace's music got the film an Academy Award for best musical score. Personally I think When I See An Elephant Fly has had more staying power.But Dumbo itself has great staying power. It's a feel good film for kids of all ages and a testimony to those folks who never give up and make lemonade when life hands them a lemon."
25,tt0033563,8,"Some people complain that the movie isn't visually impressive or doesn't hold up to recent movies. You just can't compare them! It's OK that the animation and special effects didn't take precedence over the actual story or characters and they didn't try to build an entire movie around a breakthrough in visual effects (I'm talking to you, ""Happy Feet"").I've watched Dumbo with my 2- and 4-year-olds and they like it just as much (or more) as any new release. I think it's fascinating that the bulk of the story is told through music and the sweet body language of the baby and his mother. Of course there's some important exposition that has to be given by Timothy or the gossipy elephants but overall, the most powerful scenes are when no one says a word. ""Baby Mine"" will always bring a tear to my eye.A movie that I loved as a child and has touched a different place in my heart as a mother."
26,tt0033563,9,"As a kid, I would watch over and over several Disney features: Pinnochio, Peter Pan, Bambi, Alice in Wonderland, Lady and the Tramp, and Dumbo. When I come back to those films now, I recognize that they are all marvelous films and gave Walt Disney much deserved success. It's truly sad how far Disney has fallen. All kids' flicks now are awful. I revisited Dumbo, by the way, on the same night that I first watched Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, destined to be one of the most successful films of all time. It is execrable, and it is simply pathetic how bad films like it are nowadays. I say, bring your kids back to Dumbo, Pinnochio, Bambi, and the like. They may not be as harmless as the kind of movie Disney and others shove out today. You shouldn't be afraid of your children showing emotion. I can remember more than anything being profoundly affected by the ""Baby Mine"" number from Dumbo, where he visits his imprisoned mother. Films like these will mould your children's emotional stability instead of keeping them at a safe distance and selling them toys."
27,tt0033563,8,"I first watched ''Dumbo'' when I was very young,and I always remembered of it being a beautiful and sad movie. ''Dumbo'' in a way,is about the rejection of being different from the others and how this can hurt so much the people who are victims of people's prejudice. The main character Dumbo,does not speak a single word and even this way, you can know all the feelings he is passing through. The illustrators did a great job showing all animal's emotions in this way.A funny thing is that since I was a kid, I always found the scenes were the pink elephants were shown a little bit of creepy. They look like the clowns who were mocking Dumbo, maybe that's why I never felt a good vibe coming from this part of the movie.This movie is a classic from Disney and everybody should watch, including adults!"
28,tt0033563,1,"This is the only dumbo for me, it is an american movie classic, and will always hold it's well earned place in my heart."
29,tt0033563,9,"Sweet, simple and short, 'Dumbo' is the tale of a baby elephant who is ridiculed and shunned because of his oversized ears, who with help from his friend Timothy Q. Mouse and some cunning crows, learns that he can fly. One of Disney's early animated features, the movie is less sumptuous and detailed than 'Snow White' (1937) or 'Fantasia' (1940), but is still a fine example of classic animation. Unique in a titular Disney 'hero', Dumbo never speaks, but the voice cast for the rest of the characters is excellent. The music is great, especially the clever ""When I See an Elephant Fly"", and the surreal ""Pink Elephants on Parade"" sequence is outstanding. A timeless classic."
87,tt0046183,1,"If Walt Disney had never made another cartoon feature after BAMBI in 1942 he would still be remembered as the man who transformed the animated full length film into an art form. SNOW WHITE , PINOCCHIO , FANTASIA and BAMBI all belong on the list of the greatest achievements in American Film. Disney's next phase in full length animation took place after World War 2 and although these subsequent works may not match the brilliance and creativity of the earlier films, they still possess the superb craftsmanship the Disney artists are famous for. Missing from the new batch of films was the meticulous background detail that distinguished the earlier projects. Starting with Cinderella in 1950, the animators seemed to concentrate more on clean, uncluttered backgrounds but the drawing was just as professional as before , characters still brought to life with fluid, lifelike movements. Colors tended to be bright and splashy, but the cartoonists also knew when subtlety was called for, and scenes occurring at night were done with convincing atmosphere and shadows. The success of Cinderella confirmed that the movie-going public was still willing to be entertained and moved by a cartoon movie, and Disney and his artists forged ahead with an impressive array of animated features that to this day remain models of the Art Form. Perhaps the greatest of these was PETER PAN, first released in 1953. Based on J.M. Barrie's immortal play and novel about the little boy who doesn't want to grow up, PETER PAN had been a project stewing in Disney's mind for years. It wasn't until after the War that work on the film really took off. When the movie was completed and finally released to theaters, Disney seemed rather ambivalent about its achievement. He had a hard time defining who Peter actually was as a character but to millions of children in movie theaters all over the world, that didn't seem to matter. PETER PAN is not very deep story-wise. It lacks the heart and sentiment of the Barrie original, which to some degree is a good thing. Past stage versions and the spectacular 1924 Paramount film version could be cloyingly sentimental at times.The Disney version is light and breezy and moves at a clip. The London sequence which opens the picture is spectacular in both the backdrops and the animation itself. When Peter, Wendy, John and Michael leap out of the Darling nursery window and fly over nighttime Edwardian London the viewer is treated to some of the most thrilling animation ever created for the movies. Later sections of the movie are equally enchanting, and the personage of the villainous Captain Hook is brought to great comic life by Disney animators and the marvelous vocal talent of Hans Conried. As with past Disney efforts, the song score is superb. ""Second Star to the Right"", ""You Can Fly"" and ""Your Mother and Mine"" are highlights in a tuneful soundtrack created by Sammy Cahn and Sammy Fain.PETER PAN holds a special place in my heart. It was the first movie I ever saw. As a 4 year old sitting with my father in an ornate, red carpeted movie palace in Cincinnati, Ohio, looking up at that big screen watching Peter and his friends swooping and flying over the roofs and spires of London was an overwhelming experience. I was hooked, so to speak, and it is an image that has stayed with me ever since. This is the film that initiated my love affair with movies. PETER PAN is one of the iconic films of the Baby Boom Generation."
88,tt0046387,8,"This is not an action picture, but an enchanting historical or pseudo-historical romance taken from a Charles Major novel which was very popular, especially with women, many decades ago. It tells the story of Mary, the sister of Henry VIII who was married to king Louis XII of France. But the movie tells chiefly of his love for a commoner, Brandon, and how it eventually succeeded. An excellent reconstruction of the ambiance and ways of living,of the English Court in the 16th century,  a screen play full of humor (incidentally, what became of the scenarist, Lawrence Edward Watkin, whose thirties novel ""On Borrowed Time"" was such a delight?), magnificent photography, all this contributes to make The Sword and the Rose one of the better Disney films. But what makes it exceptional, is the magnificent performances of Glynis Johns and James Robertson Justice. In Miss Johns' hands, Mary is a woman every man would be proud and satisfied to fall in love with. And the Henry VIII of Mr Justice justifies comparison with Charles Laughton's."
30,tt0034492,8,"If you talk to anyone about what film messed them up mentally as a child, Bambi is a guarantee to be in that list. Who hasn't named this film as one of the saddest movies of all time? The funny thing is, this is a children's movie! It's made by Disney! I'm convinced that Disney had to tear us down just so they could build us back up, my goodness, we are Disney Marines! Bambi is one of the training videos to make us tough, because if you can make it through this film without crying that proves that you have no heart and are dead inside. Bambi despite being one of the saddest movies of all time still has a lot of heart and is one of the best in the Disney classics. With it's beautiful animation, charming characters and breathtaking story this is a movie that no one should miss.In a forest thicket, a doe gives birth to a fawn whom she names Bambi. After he learns to walk, Bambi befriends Thumper, a young rabbit; then, while learning to talk, Bambi meets a young skunk whom he calls ""Flower"". After Bambi has completely learned how to talk, his mother takes him to the meadow, a place that is both wonderful and frightening. Bambi's mother warns him that deer are unprotected in the meadow as there are no trees or bushes to hide them, so they must take great care for their own safety. Bambi and his mother go to the meadow and discover a patch of new grass, as they eat, his mother senses a hunter and orders Bambi to flee. As they run, gun shots ring out. When Bambi arrives at their thicket, he discovers his mother is no longer with him. He grows up and learns the way of surviving being an adult deer.I do have one small problem with the film, after the tragic scene where Bambi's father tells him that his mother can no longer be with him indicating that she's dead, you're tearing up painfully and then all of a sudden it cuts to this wonderful magical music with birds and flowers! What kind of a mind screw is that?! ""Be sad, be painfully sad, you are so sad that you want to fill an ocean with your tears of sadnessNOW BE HAPPY"", I just don't get that part. However all that aside, Bambi is still a good Disney film, but it is a hard one to watch. I still think kids are a lot stronger than adults give them credit for, like I said, this movie may be a tear jerker, but it's a wonderful story of friendship and coming of age. Disney doesn't hold back when it comes to delivering a good message, bad things do happen, but we can still be a good person and live life like it was meant too. I recommend Bambi to anyone, it's a good movie with a lot of heart, just have a box of tissues ready when you watch it.8/10"
31,tt0034492,1,"Walt Disney didn't make another full-length animated film until 1950, by which time his golden age had well and truly passed.  Was `Bambi' a quiet, gentle farewell, then?  If you haven't seen it you could be forgiven for thinking so; and the slightly over-sugared opening scenes might confirm this view.  But prepare to be jolted out of your seat.  The forest contains darkness as well as light.  The gunshots that ring out across the silences are truly alarming (and there are many ways Disney and Hand make them more alarming: consider the scene where a flock of birds are cowering in the grass, until one decides to fly into the air and risk death rather than put up with the suspense).  Also worth noting about `Bambi' is its use of psychological colour.  In at least three key scenes, the colour scheme shifts wildly, not because the sun has set or anything of that kind, but in order to illustrate Bambi's psychological state.  Particularly fine is the scene where he is running away from the clearing in fear and the world turns into just a few pale and dirty shades of yellow.The greatest thing is the way Disney manages to convince us that there is nothing else in the world, outside the forest.  Not once do we see a horizon.  Nor do we sense one.  By some standards not much happens in the forest - a few deaths, a few births, what else is new?  But when the forest is the whole world they matter a good deal."
32,tt0034492,8,"Blissful, playful, moving and inspiring, Walt Disney's ""Bambi"" is a precious jewel that will last longer than most of us will. Indeed, it has a timeless quality, matched with a charming music score and wonderful character voices. Pauline Kael of The New Yorker poked fun at the voice-changes when the infant animals grow up over winter (sort of a puberty-in-the-thicket), but what other way was there to show the passage of time and how it changes everything, even the woodland creatures we take for granted? It's an amazing achievement. The song score never elicited a hit the size of, say, ""When You Wish Upon a Star"", but it does feature the sprightly ""Little April Showers"", which underscores the very best sequence. ***1/2 from ****"
33,tt0038166,7,"Most everything about this neat little movie has been said by previous posters, except this.The motivation for making it was, of all things, the US State Department! The US was deeply involved in fighting World War Two. At this point in time the average American knew almost NOTHING about South America, and the Nazi government was busy making business and political connections there, especially in Paraguay... there, transplanted Germans were a well established colony. They were aiding Hitler's war effort with the operation of industrial concerns, as well as providing espionage support.South America promised to become a new battlefront if German successes and infiltration continued. The region produced vital strategic raw materials, key among them rubber.Our strongest ally in the region was Brazil. The US Navy had a number of installations there, both sea and air. The Brazilian Navy worked closely with US forces in hunting U-boats in the Atlantic narrows; a number of US Navy vessels were transferred to them. American air bases (the largest of which was at Recife) provides home base for American aircraft, both fixed wing and lighter than air blimps, to provide air support coverage to trans Atlantic convoy operations.The State department felt it would be a good idea to familiarize Americans with the land, people, and way of life of South America, and called on Disney to produce THE THREE CABALLEROS. The movie was, first and foremost, a TEACHING TOOL for both military forces and the general public during a global war.BTW... I love the crazy little bird too! HE'S the best part of the film!There are two other Disney films made for the Government that I'd LOVE to find copies of.One is VICTORY THROUGH AIR POWER, another WW2 product.The other is one that I saw back in Basic Training in the 1970s. Believe it or not, the Walt Disney studios produced a military training film on the prevention of VENEREAL DISEASE!!! The unfortunate Lady dispensing said commodity bore a VERY striking resemblance to Snow White! Because of that film I can never view SNOW WHITE in quite the same way ever again!"
34,tt0038166,8,"The Three Caballeros is a lot of fun, using a mix of live action and animation to bring Brazil and Mexico alive to birthday boy Donald Duck. As he's joined by Panchito and José he realises what he has been missing all these years, falls in love with Aurora Miranda (sister of Carmen), learns to dance, and much more.With eye-poppingly beautiful animation and lovely colours, it is no surprise that that was the one cartoon Disney veteran Ward Kimball claimed he was truly proud of. The idea of the three birds as international musketeers living the good life is inspired and the running time is just about right."
35,tt0038166,8,"It was a cold January Saturday evening. The park was beautifully lit. People were cheery. We could see the Matterhorn on our right hand side. Magical is the best description I could find.Suddenly, I started singing...""Somos los tres carros, los Tres Caballeros, y nadie es igual a nosotros...""What do I know. My friends all knew the words. 4 guys, ranging from 27 to 31 years old, began forming a chrous line and singing off the top of our lungs...I don't know how this happened. This is not, by any stretch of imagination, a popular or wildly succesful film. I guess it just touched us, the way Donald Duck had a mexican friend (Panchito), or the wild ""Piñata"" scene, or the strong latin flavour of the film.Memories notwithstanding, we kept on singing... and singing... and singing.People around us seemed to enjoy the show, too.""Valientes brillamos, como brilla un peso-Quien dice?!?NOSOTROS, LOS TRES CABALLEROS!"""
36,tt0038166,1,"Yippie-ey-ya! This has got to be one of Disney most best ever short story movies! Not only is it educational but it is also fun and dazzling with colours. The fiesta starts when Donald gets three presents from his friends in Brazil. One of them contains short stories from South America like ""The Flying Donkey"" and ""Pablo the Cold Bloodest Pengiun"", the second pops out his good friend from the 1943 film ""Saludos Amigos"", Jose Carioca, as I said, one of Walt's best 1940's characters shows him around South America in the storybook then the bizarreness begins when Panchito the rooster comes out of the third present with guns a blazing! It all turns into a Topsy-turvy South American Mania!! Yowee! Along the way, it was the first film in history to use cartoon characters mixing in a normal world environment as Donald fall for a real life Mexican actress. That must have been big new sign of technology back in those days. In remember as old photo in England from July, 1945 when people were sadly queueing up for rationing and the Three Caballeros was up on a billboard behind them being advertised. That must of brought them joy during the most hardest of time. I strongly recommend this movie and if you don't like it, then you're a bean-head! 10/10"

Disney film encompasses all of their early strengths as a studio: enchanting romance, sly good humor, sword-fighting action, terrific production values and beautiful background score (which, by the way, if you find on vinyl is worth a pretty penny). Pure fun, with captivating Glynis Johns as Mary, Richard Todd dashing as Brandon, and Justice the best English King I have ever seen on film. A joy! *** from ****"
37,tt0038718,8,"Make Mine Music finds Walt Disney in the midst of the transitional period between his first five animated features (Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Pinocchio, Fantasia, Dumbo, Bambi) and the post-war revival begun with Cinderella (1950). The idea of a casual variant of Fantasia featuring popular music was a good one. Even though the segments which comprise the film vary in quality, the film as a whole is a bright, colorful and amusing light entertainment which fit wartime needs ideally. Highlights include two spirited Benny Goodman swing numbers (""All The Cats Join In"" and ""After You've Gone"") and the unforgettable finale, ""Willie the Operatic Whale"", narrated and sung by Nelson Eddy. The animation is generally first-rate and the Technicolor film will dazzle any viewer not expecting a genuine masterwork. Make Mine Music was successful enough to warrant a considerably better follow-up, Melody Time (1948).The undistinguished but harmless ""Martins and the Coys"" segment, concerning the gun-feuding backwoods families of American folklore, has idiotically been removed from current editions, evidently for PC reasons. It's scary that Disney may start altering their classics to meet artificial modern standards. (If they had cut anything from Make Mine Music, it should have been the tasteless ""Two Silhouettes"" ballet, all doilies and valentines and icky fake sentiment.)"
38,tt0038718,8,"""Make Mine Music"" is a beautifully crafted binding of Disney shorts, and I think it is an improvement over ""Melody Time"". ""Melody Time"" did have some memorable parts especially ""Once Upon a Wintertime"", ""Bumble Boogie"" and ""Johnny Appleseed"", but what made ""Make Mine Music"" better was that it had a somewhat better variety of music and that it contains some of my all time favourite Disney moments. But like it is with ""Melody Time"" the success of the shorts is variable.""The Martins and the Coys""(10/10)-Man I loved this! Probably the most underrated of all the shorts featured in this film. It mayn't be to everyone's tastes now, and it does stereotype the Appalachians, but what makes it so enormously entertaining is the fluid and colourful quality of the animation, the rollicking soundtrack and the vocals.""Blue Bayou""(10/10)- I don't know where to begin praising ""Blue Bayou"". Whether it was the stunning animation, with the pristine and perfect blue backgrounds, the poetic lyrics and the lyrical, sensual melody of the song. And the music is sublimely sung.""All the Cats Join In""(10/10)-One cool and jazzy cartoon. I am not always that fond of jazz admittedly, but the music courtesy of Benny Goodman and his orchestra is wonderful. Topped with clever and sophisticated animation and the story, even for a combination cartoon, works effectively.""Without You""(9/10)- I liked this, the animation is gorgeous in this sequence and the song itself is sweet and memorable. Andy Russell does a good job with the singing. I will say though it doesn't rank as a favourite, and I can't put my finger on why, maybe it was to do with where it was placed in the film.""Casey at the Bat""(8/10)-The pace is rushed here, but this cartoon is entertaining. I for one liked Jerry Colonna's mini-commentary-like vocals here, and I liked the animation too. ""Casey at the Bat"" is also very funny, certainly makes a game of baseball entertaining.""Two Silhouettes""(8/10)-Don't get me wrong, I really liked this sequence. It is sentimental and sappy of course, but it looked beautiful, with graceful dancing, and the song was lovely, sensitively sung by Dinah Shore.""Peter and the Wolf""(9.5/10)-Easily one of the better shorts of the film. Not my personal favourite by all means, but definitely memorable. The animation is beautiful here, the music is outstanding and the story is effective. Not to mention the characters are very well done, in fact the Wolf when my sister and I were little was so scary for us, my sister still refuses to see this cartoon, as she got nightmares from the Wolf and the French horn motif played to signify his entrance.""After You've Gone""(8/10)- I do prefer ""All the Cats Join In"" but this is full of jazz and pizazz. It's running time though is disappointingly scant, and it is a tad rushed. The artwork is beautifully done though, and the music is wonderful. Another example of a combination cartoon, and works well at it.""Johnnie Fedora and Alice Bluebonnet""(10/10)- I love how beautiful, simple and poignant this is. Coupled with nice animation, lovely music and beautifully blended vocals from the Andrews Sisters, this is a definite must.""Willie the Operatic Whale""(or ""The Whale Who Wanted to Sing At the Met"")(10/10)-Save the best until last I'd say. Along with ""Peter and the Wolf"" this is the only other cartoon from the film I was familiar with before watching. This one is unforgettable, truly unforgettable with a truly special whale. The animation is gorgeous and charming, and the singing from undervalued Nelson Eddy is outstanding. What made this though was the opera music, it was wonderful to hear ""Largo Al Factotum"" from ""Barber of Seville"" and ""Sextet"" from ""Lucia Di Lammermoor"" to name a few. This was the cartoon that introduced me to the wonderful world of opera, that's why it is so special to be.Overall, while there are one or two sequences that aren't as good as others, ""Make Mine Music"" is beautifully crafted, and I would recommend it. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
39,tt0038718,6,"An episodic musical tapestry a' la Fantasia, only this one utilizes the pop music of circa 1946.  Some are worth viewing, and others are worth fast-forwarding through.

I haven't seen the now-deleted ""The Martins and the Coys"" sequence, but I do oppose the tampering of classic films in the name of ""PC"".

Divvied up into separate musical suites (utilizing pop, jazz, Big Band, and the Russian classical piece ""Peter and the Wolf""), ""Make Mine Music"" is musically of its time, featuring the talents of Benny Goodman, Dinah Shore, Nelson Eddy, etc. In that regard, it dates far worse than ""Fantasia"", and comes to a virtual halt in the middle of an overstretched slapstick baseball satire, but there are incidental pleasures. The popular ""Peter and the Wolf"" segment, which was later serialized on Disney's TV program and found a large following, is the only segment that feels fully thought-out (and has involving animation), while ""The Whale Who Wanted To Sing At The Met"" is an interesting idea (with beautiful flourishes) in search of a narrative (the hero actually ends up in Heaven...complete with angel's wings!).

I had seen and been excited by ""Fantasia"" and the ""MMM"" numbers, as a late teenager, I found hugely enjoyable. I'm sad to learn that the ""Martins and the Coys"" number has been deleted - it was fun and the hill billy feuding' was something we'd found amusing and harmless. I disagree with some of the comments on the individual numbers, particularly ""Without You"" by Andy Russell and ""Two Silhouettes"" by Dinah Shore, both of which made an impression on me and I've been trying to obtain a record of the former for years, without success. I have fond memories of ""Johnny Fedora and Alic Blue Bonnet"" (absurdly sentimental though it was)and can sing the first lines to this day. The Benny Goodman numbers are superb - musically and animation-wise - but then I'm a B.G.fan and ever will be. ""Peter and the Wolf"" persuaded me to listen to the real classical version and, subsequently, to buy the sound track record. Perhaps I do agree with the viewer who found Jerry Colonna's rendering of ""Casey"" a lemon but then you either take Jerry's versions of things or you don't. Nelson (""The singing capon"")Eddy's version of ""Willie"" was a delight, though in later years it may have made one more conscious of the bloody aspects of whale hunting. Anyway, it was good to hear Nelson without ""Heart of Steel"" Jeanette MacDonald. You see, without seeing the film again the memories come tumbling out and I've given it a 9 for more reasons than one. Please will somebody tell me where I can obtain a VHS copy ? David Miles"

Uncle Remus (James Baskett, who is utterly, utterly exceptional) is perhaps the most charming character you'll find. He's much more stereotypical of an elderly man than a black man. A smart man with strong morals and a clever way of delivering them, he seems to see things more clearly than anyone else in the film. No, Uncle Remus is a kind man who loves humanity, and this love is infectious. The movie made me very happy to be alive. A more politically correct version of the film would have him rebelling against white society with violence. It's kind of sad that we can't abide blacks and whites actually getting along, preaching brotherhood. The live action bits are very good (although I think Bobby Driscoll is a bit weak in the lead), but it is the animated pieces (and the live action/animation sequences) that make Song of the South great. Br'er Rabbit, Fox, and Bear are wonderful characters, and these three segments represent some of the best animation Disney ever did. The mixed scenes are amazing (was this the first time it was done?). I especially liked when Uncle Remus went fishing with Br'er Frog. Uncle Remus lights his pipe with an animated flame, and blows an animated smoke ring that turns into a square (which is, of course, also politically incorrect). I suspect that the biggest reason this film stirs so many negative emotions is the black dialect used in the film. I think that bugs people a lot. Really, though, blacks from the rural South have and have had their own accents and ways of speaking just as they have and have had in any other region. While the accents in this film are somewhat fabricated, I'm sure, I think that it would be a far cry to think of them as harmful to anybody. The hurt that people feel over this movie is the real fabrication, induced by PC thugs who seem to want to cause rifts between peoples. I think that a re-release of Song of the South could possibly have a beneficial effect on race relations in the United States, as it does depict dear friendships and respect between the races, something that I think we quite need at the moment."
1402,tt0352248,1,"Truly inspiring story of James J. Braddock. This story is about more than boxing. It is about a man and his wife trying to raise a family in the tough times of the 1920s. And the integrity and example he shows his children in those times. Russell Crowe, Renee Zellweger and Paul Giamatti are just part of this incredible cast. It is a must see."
1403,tt0352248,9,"The dilemma: I hate boxing movies; I love Russell Crowe movies. I've already seen ""Million Dollar Baby"" and ""Raging Bull"" this year, and accidentally watched part of one of the ""son of Rocky"" serial movies on a Saturday afternoon. I feel like I am being punched, as Renee' Zellwegger's character Mae Braddock says, and I'm not as tough as these prize fighters.But this one has Russell Crowe in it. And that makes all the difference. It is not that Renee Zellwegger and Paul Giamatti, Paddy Considine, Bruce McGill and Craig Bierko, among others, give less than stellar performances: they all live up to their justifiably great reputations. You have to believe they are at the top of their game. But for all of Russell Crowe's reputation for being ""difficult"", it is hard to think of actors who can equal his personal force on the screen. He is brilliant. Ron Howard has made of the real life of Depression-era prize-fighter James J. Braddock a work of art. The camera work is phenomenal. Without using violins or cliché' pull-back shots showing the numbers of people homeless and in soup lines, Howard makes the Depression a visceral reality with scenes of near-hopeless men at the docks, pleading for a day's work; a stolen salami; Crowe's giving his daughter his breakfast piece of bologna, telling her he dreamed he was full. The bleakness of the times is the graininess and the sepia/greyness of the camera shots; the images are stark but completely descriptive. Crowe as Braddock with hat in hand and tears in his eyes, begging for twenty dollars so he can get his children back into his home, is the personification of pride sacrificed to desperation. But when Braddock is later asked at a press conference why he is fighting at his age and after so many poor showings, all he has to say is ""milk"" to be supremely eloquent.Doubtless many people know the history of James Braddock, and know the outcome of his fights, including the championship bout with Max Baer, who had already killed two men in the ring. If you don't know, DON'T look it up before you see the movie, and if you DO KNOW, DON'T TELL, but go. Analogous to watching Howard's film ""Apollo 13"", you may know the outcome, but there's wonderful suspense in the details. These were among the most exciting last twenty minutes I've seen on film. I didn't expect to be able to watch, but like Braddock's terrified wife Mae, I was unable to tear myself away.The audience was like a prize fight audience, cheering, booing, gasping, groaning during the fights. We applauded Braddock's wins, suffered his defeats. It is a great movie, with authentic heart. Solid A."
44,tt0039404,7,"Fun and Fancy Free is for me one of Disney's lesser efforts, but is still very charming, simple and enjoyable. I did think the live action sequences were dated though, and the film is quite short. Out of all the characters, the only character I didn't care for that much was the puppet. Apart from the hilarious ""well she used to be a good milker, but now... she is an udder failure"" he didn't really make an impact on me. Maybe it was because the ventriloquism was rather substandard.However, I really enjoyed this on the whole. The introduction with Jiminy Cricket- voiced by the one and only Cliff Edwards- in the library was very effective, as was a vast majority of the script. The animation is stunning, and by far the best aspect of the movie, and I hope I am not the only person who found the songs beautiful and memorable, my favourite being ""My what a happy day"".There are two mini-classics here, Bongo and Mickey and the Beanstalk. Both are wonderful gems, but I will admit I do prefer the latter. Bongo tells the rather simple story of the adorable Bongo and his endeavour into a world he has never known before, after being the star attraction of a circus. It is very sweet and well meaning, and the narration isn't so bad either. Mickey and the Beanstalk is a favourite of mine. Wonderful voice acting, terrific animation especially for the beanstalk and nice music made this memorable for me.Other things that impressed were one Jiminy Cricket of course, well how can he not impress, he is a classic character in the history of animation? Two, I thought Edgar Bergen was very entertaining in this film asides from the ventriloquism, and also child actress Luana Patten was impressive.All in all, one of Disney's lesser efforts, but has undeniable charm due to the animated segments and Cricket himself. 7/10 Bethany Cox"
45,tt0039404,7,"This is a good combination of two animated stories/shorts: Bongo and Micky and the Beanstalk.  while watching a mixture of stories and a mixture of animation and live action was a little awkward, Jiminy Cricket held it together.  This film's latest release on video gives everyone the opportunity to see this tiny treasure for the first time.  While, it doesn't rank up with the Best of Disney's animation, it is still worth seeing, if nothing else for Walt Disney's last film as the voice of Mickey."
46,tt0039404,1,"The duo of Disney and RKO continue the magic onto 1947 with this flick, ""Fun and Fancy Free."" In it are a couple of wonderful and terrific stories: ""Bongo,"" and ""Mickey and the Beanstalk."" Again, this movie has everything that you would expect in a Disney classic. Also, look out for more great Disney friends, like Jiminy Cricket!!!!!One interesting fact: did you know that Walt Disney, the man who created Mickey, was the voice of Mickey Mouse? In ""Mickey and the Beanstalk,"" Walt Disney himself voiced as Mickey Mouse, and that would end up being his last cartoon to do so.So, this shows that movies like this just aren't made anymore. (sniff) But still, watch this movie with your children, enjoy it, and have a whole lot of fun with ""Fun and Fancy Free!!!!!"" 10 out of 10 stars."
47,tt0039404,1,"This package film from the Disney studio is simple but just irresistible as it features two colorful and cute cartoons interwoven with Edger Bergen and his famous dummies Charlie McCarthy and Mortimer Snerd.The first segment is ""Bongo"" based on a short story by Sinclair Lewis. With the exception of narrator Dinah Shore, the whole thing is dialog free and although it moves along at a leisurely pace, it is good enough for the kids but adults will most certainly squirm.The next segment is ""Mickey and the Beanstalk"" which has Bergan doing the narration of the classic fairy tale starring Mickey, Donald and Goofy as they face Willie the Giant (voiced amusingly by Billy Gilbert). Although the cartoon is cute and amusing, Bergen and his dummies along with the adorable Luana Patten provide the bulk of the laughs. I can't help but compare the approach in this segment to ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" because of the good-natured riffing done by Charlie and Mortimer. It makes you wish that Walt Disney had used this formula for other films like ""Alice in Wonderland"" or ""Cinderella."" It goes without saying that Charlie's riffing on Bergen's storytelling is a particular highlight.I say see this film. It'll warm your heart and keep you amused. Plus, it doesn't have the blatant pop culture jokes you get in contemporary animated films."
48,tt0039404,1,"If you ask me, I think Walt Disney put into this movie more of his cheerful, laid-back nature than any other and I haven't even seen a possible making-of featurette to prove because, currently, I only have this on video which is at least 7 years old now. I think it's fair to say that ""Fun and Fancy Free"" is exactly what it says on the tin. It opens with a lively chorus singing the title song and I love how when the animations begins to start up the song follows onto Jiminy Cricket (voiced by Cliff Edwards, died 1971, (I think) at 76) singing his own verses, a laid-back, cheerful happy fellow riding on a large leaf in what soon appears to be a vase. In order to cheer up a sad doll missing her mama and a moody teddy Jiminy puts on a vinyl record telling a story... BONGO: The expressive, vivacious and energetic enthusiasm of narrator Dinah Shore is just unbelievable! Bongo, a former circus bear who had been mistreated by the ring-master, longs to be free and eventually gets his dream! He is befriended by all the forest animals and also falls in love - but will things go smoothly? Give you a clue; ""Every deer and every dove has a way of making love but a bear likes to say it with a SLAP""MICKEY AND THE BEANSTALK: Jiminy finds an invitation to a party across the way and here's who was there; Luana Patten (died 1996, just 57) the hilariously cheeky Charlie McCarthy, the dazed and absent-minded Mortimer Snerd and the man who threw the party Edgar Bergen (died 1978, 75). Edgar Bergen tries to tell a story (in spite of his frustration at Charlie's frequent interruptions and criticisms) of Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck and Goofy living in poverty leaving Mickey and Goofy miserable and Donald having some violent fits of psychotic rage. Bergen defends him to the end. What about the others? Mickey and Goofy went through it too and they didn't try to murder the family cow! The only way to bring happiness to their home is to fetch an enchanted harp from the castle of a selfish giant but it's an not easy mission because if you can fool Willie the giant you can fool anyone! Can they do it? Mortimer becomes upset at when finally became of the giant and as Edgar tries to comfort him the roof is suddenly torn off by... the giant. Not to eat them but to just pop in. This cartoon musical extravaganza truly did make history in animation; that eye-popping blend of art and live action has been done practically throughout the entire movie. And there's neither bad language nor sex scenes nor violence - just full of Fun and Fancy Free!"
49,tt0039404,6,"The 9th animated Disney classic is something I have mixed feelings about, in similarity to what happens with ""The Three Caballeros"".It's a curious cartoon with some to offer, yet not one of Disney's finest creations.For one thing, I like its introduction. I was surprised when I heard a familiar singing voice. I thought «This voice sounds like Jiminy Cricket». And in the next moment, Jiminy Cricket appears, voiced by the same Cliff Edwards. Another interesting fact is that Jiminy Cricket is the narrator of the story in some parts. He introduces us the first of the two stories, ""Bongo"": it is the story of a little circus bear that runs away from the circus and discovers what it's like to be free.I liked the story of Bongo and the character itself. He's a cute and adorable little bear. This is, without a doubt, the best segment of this motion picture. It is, however, narrated by Dinah Shore.As for the second and final segment, ""Mickey and the Beanstalk"", it is narrated by Edgar Bergen, but before that there are a few live-action scenes where Edgar Bergen is working as a ventriloquist and tells the tale to child actress Luana Patten. After the end of the story, there are a few more live-action scenes like this and Jiminy Cricket appears in both.As for the segment itself, needless to say it is based on ""Jack and the Beanstalk"". It's not a bad segment, but honestly I found it nothing special. It features, however, well known cartoons like Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck and Goofy. It also features Willie, the famous temperamental giant from some Disney tales. Mickey Mouse is voiced by Walt Disney himself, while Donald Duck is voiced by the inimitable Clarence Nash."
50,tt0039404,6,"After WWII, the Walt Disney company released a couple feature films that were actually nothing more than a few long cartoons strung together to feature length. The result were movies like this one as well as ""Make Mine Music"" and ""The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad"" which are essentially movies that seem a bit disjoint, as the theme that links the shorts is tenuous at best. Here, ""Fun and Fancy Free"" is a vague term and really has nothing to do with the cartoons. In addition, the quality of the two cartoons is quite different.The first cartoon, ""Bongo"", frankly is awfully lame. Despite having some nice splashy colors, the story is weak and should have supported an 8-10 minute film--not a short running over a half hour. Plus, so much of the film seemed like filler--with LOTS and LOTS of singing from Dinah Shore and others. It's the story of a miserable circus bear who longs to be free. But, when a chance opportunity occurs and he escapes, life in the wild isn't as easy as he expected. Apart from a few cute characters (including a girl bear--you can tell because she has a flower growing out of her head), there isn't much to recommend it. I assume kids of the day really were bored by the cartoon and its watchability is not great. I'd score this one a 4---mostly because the animation is pretty good.The final cartoon is the one kids will love, as it features Mickey, Donald and Goofy. Oddly, however, unlike the first cartoon, this one features a lot of live-action--with Edgar Bergen and his puppets entertaining a cute little girl with a Disney-fied version of ""Jack and the Beanstalk"". In this version, the three heroes take on the mean giant--wonderfully brought to life by the voice of Billy Gilbert. While it's clearly a variation of an earlier Disney film (""The Brave Little Tailor""), it still is very watchable and cute. Not a brilliant film, nevertheless it actually makes ""Fun and Fancy Free"" worth seeing. Plus, fans of Edgar Bergen will enjoy seeing him and his characters. I particularly enjoyed Charlie's 'Udder failure' comment. I'd give this one an 8.Overall, it's a highly uneven and odd hodgepodge that, frankly, is not especially great viewing. However, the accompanying documentary about this, ""The Story Behind Walt Disney's Fun & Fancy Free"" is a lot more interesting than the film itself--so if you get the DVD, be sure to watch this in the special features."
90,tt0046387,1,"After reading all of the negative reviews on this movie, I just had to give one on my opinion. This is my all time favorite movie. I love the dynamics between the actors and the chemistry between Charles Brandon and the Princess Mary. I love that I can sit down to watch it and feel the emotion that was meant for the viewer to feel. So what if there are discrepancies in the storyline, the wardrobe, and the actors portrayal of the real people from history? I don't really care. This is a great movie, and it will always be at the very top of my favorites list. If you know what's good for you, you will watch it, you will LOVE it, and you will tell your friends how amazing it is, too!"
103,tt0047803,1,"I saw this documentary in 1960 at age 11 and never forgot it. It was very well done. It is wonderful. I watched with my father who is gone for 28 years. I was so impressed with the beauty of the species that spent collecting everything I could about animals. The scenes are beautifully shot and encourage children to like and, of course, preserve animal life. Fantastic, wonderful. Just the initial presentation of the documentary to paint the map of Africa and its different regions, it is a lesson in Geography.In the following years despite developments in technology not seen documentaries that level which makes it even more valuable. It is an example of a job well done.Unfortunate not copy for sale there."
51,tt0039404,7,"Fun Disney picture with two stories. The first is Bongo, a cute story about a little bear falling in love and having to fight a bigger bear for his lady. Flimsy story but it moves along quickly enough. It's over a half-hour long but I didn't even really think about how long it was until after it was over so I certainly can't complain about the pacing. This story was narrated by Dinah Shore, who also sings. Lovely voice. Modern viewers, particularly those with a dark sense of humor, might see a domestic violence message in this one. Bongo was something of a 'gangsta.' The second story is the Mickey Mouse version of Jack and the Beanstalk. I know I saw this one many times as a kid but, for the life of me, I don't remember seeing Bongo before today. So perhaps this was released on a VHS collection or something back in the day, separate from this film. This one is narrated by ventriloquist Edgar Bergen, who also appears in a live action segment doing his puppet routine in what appears to be a private birthday party for a little girl who I hoped was his daughter but turns out it was Disney child star Luana Patten. A little creepy but different times.Jiminy Cricket also appears in the beginning and in a linking segment from the first story to the second. As always with classic Disney, the animation is excellent, with beautiful drawings and rich colors. Love the music, as well. This is far from my favorite Disney movie, even limited to the compilation ones. But I do enjoy it a lot and I can't imagine most Disney fans not liking it."
52,tt0039404,6,"This ""Fun and Fancy Free"" DVD (cheerfully brought to you by Disney Studios) contains two, enjoyable, 35-minute animated films from 1947.Hosted by everyone's favourite insect - Jiminy Cricket - These 2 tales of fun-fun-fun and fancy-free adventure also feature several musical numbers as an added bonus.Story #1 is all about Bongo, the circus bear, who desperately wants to get himself back to the forest, like, pronto.Story #2 has Mickey Mouse (taking the place of Jack), along with Donald Duck and Goofy, climbing the beanstalk all the way up to the nasty giant's fantastic castle in the sky - ""Fee-Fye-Foe-Fum!"" *Note* - Mickey Mouse was voiced by Walt Disney, himself."

Thank you Disney you made my childhood what it is today.It really should be respected higher. It is classic. The songs, the characters. Even still toady I still sing Goofy's song. And Bongo the circus bear. So much character and nothing said at all. One of Disney's best and should be on IMDb's top 250. And the ending with the Giant and coming through the roof I was so terrified of that when I saw that as a child. The ventriloquism was great to, that little girl was good as well I wonder who she was.... 10/10"
54,tt0040580,9,"All possibly to reflect Walt Disney's dreams and possibly some of his new ideas, while the world was recovering from the terrifying Second World War, Disney released ""Melody Time"", a collection of beautiful, heartwarming, musical and entertaining shorts. At the beginning, a speaking mask (who at times is the narrator), explains that there is something for everyone and there indeed just about is! A lot of different kind of shorts await you and you are bound to like at least one a little bit.In order of when the shorts are shown:""Once Upon A Wintertime"": A different kind of Disney animation, including pristine backgrounds, Disney shows a rather messy winter love story. Not the best short in the bunch, but definitely not the least best, with a good woman singer. ""Bumble Boogie"": Good for the eye, this short shows a very angry and upset bee trapped and flustered in a world of musical caterpillars and images. A good short mainly for the older, for the young it may be a bit upsetting, especially as the bee is quite a likable character.""Johnny Appleseed"": One of the few shorts with a proper plot, with some of the best animation in the set, Johnny Appleseed is a heartwarming story, you may even be inclined to believe this beautiful American story is true! Good for all ages.""Little Toot"": Unfortunately, this short is rather tedious babyish and a slight bit depressing, probably the least good of the lot. However, it is likely to entertain the wee ones and maybe some grown-ups would not mind watching it.""Tree"": Is basically a poem, a moving painting and a picture of a tree. Like ""Bumble Boogie"", it is plot less and another feast for the eyes, hopefully it will become your favourite of the set. Very beautiful for any animation and stunning.""Blame It On The Samba"": Featuring Donald Duck, a parrot friend of his and a rascal of a waiter bird! Showing a naughty bird bullying and entertaining Donald Duck and his friend with the amazement and annoyance of the samba.""Pecos Bill"": The last of the set, Pecos Bill is pretty entertaining - even with a rather tedious beginning and animation that could do with some work. The songs and characters are certainly entertaining. It shows a young boy being bought up by coyotes and becoming a ""rooting, tootin' cowboy"".So, enjoy ""Melody Time""!"
55,tt0040580,6,"During the '40s many of the animated films released by the Disney studios were compilation-style movies. By that, I mean that instead of telling one story over the course of 80 or so minutes, the films were made up of a series of short animated stories linked together. The most successful example of this approach was ""Fantasia"" (which was linked together by pieces of classical music), but nowadays many people are not aware that the studio made several films of this kind. ""The Three Caballeros"", ""Make Music Mine"", ""Saludos Amigos"", ""Fun and Fancy Free"" and ""Melody Time"" are some of the other examples.Melody Time is split into seven sections. ""Once Upon A Wintertime"" deals with a loving couple who go ice-skating on a frozen river; ""Bumble Boogie"" deals with a bee which is pursued by a variety of living musical instruments to the accompaniment of Rimsky Korsakov's Flight Of The Bumblebee; ""Johnny Appleseed"" retells an old American legend about a pioneer who struck out west and planted the first apple forests; ""Little Toot"" deals with a mischievous young tugboat which redeems itself by saving a liner in a storm; ""Trees"" is a short poetic sequence in which the title tells you all you need to know; ""Blame It On The Samba"" is a simple dance sequence starring Donald Duck; and ""Pecos Bill"", which begins with real-life actors (among them Bobby Driscoll) talking around a desert campfire, and proceeds to relate the animated story of the titular Wild West character who was raised by coyotes and got into various wacky adventures.Generally-speaking, I find the longer sequences the best. The opening sequence, ""Wintertime"", is excellent, with just the right touch of comedy and excitement. ""Little Toot"" is excellent too - arguably the best episode in the film in fact. And ""Pecos Bill"" is thoroughly entertaining and has some laugh-out-loud moments. Of the longer episodes, only ""Johnny Appleseed"" feels laboured and frankly dull. The shorter episodes are actually rather disappointing. ""Bumble Boogie"" has terrific musical accompaniment, but is forgettable; ""Trees"" is pleasant but ordinary; and ""Blame It On The Samba"" looks like a rejected sequence from The Three Caballeros (1947), and is by far the most irritating sequence in this film, despite the presence of the perennially popular Donald Duck. On the whole, Melody Time might only really appeal to Disney completists; it has amusing and ingenious moments though you have to wade through some dull stretches to find them."
56,tt0040580,1,"One thing children don't have anymore is appreciation for (or even knowledge of) legendary American heroes, whether fictional, exaggerated, or real. Public ""schools"" have even gotten in the habit of eradicating our Founding Fathers from American History. Here in this wondrous Walt Disney classic the Magic Paintbrush will take us back to the days of Johnny Appleseed, Paul Bunyon, Pecos Bill and others. I'm writing this from fond memory of having seen it 55 years ago. I remember it well. If me and the wife go to a movie this weekend, one thing is certain: If we successfully choose the very best movie at the multiplex we will have forgotten it by the next day. Hollywood simply does not make quality movies anymore. Cars? It wasn't bad; but who will remember it in 5 weeks let alone 50 years? Melody Time was Walt Disney at his low ebb. He would soon regain his reputation with Cinderella, Peter Pan and Treasure Island. Disney at his low ebb beats the pants off today's Hollywood at their very best."

57,tt0040580,7,"Overall, I enjoyed ""Melody Time"" very much. It isn't as good as ""Fantasia"", which I consider a perfect introduction to classical music, but there are some entertaining parts. Elevated by some lovely animation, good songs and cute characters it is very pleasant to watch, even if there are segments that are better than others.""Once Upon a Wintertime""(9/10)- One of my personal favourite segments from the film. I admit I knew about this one long before seeing ""Melody Time"" from watching my old Christmas videos. The animation is absolutely gorgeous in this segment, with a nice romantic story and a truly beautiful title song, sublimely sung by Frances Langford.""Bumble Boogie""(9/10)- When I first heard of this I thought ""Rimsky Korsakov jazzed up? How will that turn out?"" My verdict is surprisingly entertaining, despite its scant running time and being a tad too rushed, with a cute and endearing title character, nice animation and a clever arrangement of ""Flight of the Bumble Bee"". I will say I don't know what Rimsky Korsakov would make of it though, he was very particular about how he liked his orchestration.""Johnny Appleseed""(10/10)- My personal favourite. Very colourful visually, with some lively songs and the perfect melodious voice of Dennis Day elevated it to a greater level. Could've easily been very dull in terms of story, but the above elements made it worth seeing.""Little Toot""(8/10)- I have one word for this little segment- CUTE! Little Toot himself is adorable. I loved the animation and music here, the Andrews Sisters have wonderful voices that blend beautifully together. A little too slow in places.""Trees""(8/10)- Plot-less it is, but it is a visual and musical feast, and the poetic narration was lovely. If only it wasn't so short! ""Blame it on the Samba""(7/10)- Sorry, this was my least favourite, despite the presence of the wonderful Donald Duck and his little green parrot buddy. Excellent music and decent animation, but the editing and pacing seemed somewhat rushed, and for some strange reason Ethel Smith left me cold.""Pecos Bill""(8/10)- This is one rootin' tootin' cartoon. While starting off a little tedious and some of the characters were a bit deflated, there were however some very nice backgrounds, funny moments and a corker of a soundtrack. Not to mention the fabulous Roy Rogers, wow! Overall, uneven mix but pleasant enough. 7/10 Bethany Cox"
58,tt0040580,6,"Seven animated musical shorts from Walt Disney (with some live-action interspersed) include themes of young love and the wonders of nature. Highlights are the raucous ""Pecos Bill"" segment and the story of ""Johnny Appleseed"". Obviously, ""Melody Time"" was a holding-pattern release for the studio while they completed their more high-profile pictures. Certainly it is filled with gorgeous color, animated grandeur, and old-fashioned songs, but it's considered to be one of Disney's lesser efforts, and for good reason. The lack of a strong theme, matched with Disney's penchant for cuteness, may cause some non-Disney buffs to start squirming after thirty minutes or so. Pretty much interchangeable with ""Make Mine Music"", which was released in 1946. **1/2 from ****"
59,tt0041890,9,"""So Dear to My Heart"" is the sort of unabashed bit of schmaltz that Disney did very well and which you would never see today. It's pure Americana--the sort of perfectly groomed and manicured America that Walt Disney himself wanted to promote--and which he later promoted with Disneyland and Disneyworld. It represents a look at a time and place that isn't realistic--it's more hyper-idealized and sweet--and it's pure nostalgia. Some might balk at this sort of thing--I felt like it was an incredibly sweet film.The story is about a boy (Bobby Discoll) and his pet lamb. It's also a parable about hard work, determination and good old fashioned values. And, it culminates with the lamb going to the county fair.When the film was tested, audiences didn't like that there was no animation as they expected animation in a Disney film. I really do NOT think it was needed and the animated sequences are completely unnecessary for the film, though they have a certain charm. I think they weren't needed because the film had so much going for it already--great acting by Driscoll (a very talented child actor), Beulah Bondi and Burl Ives, some AMAZING cinematography (with amazing shots of forests and meadows) and a nice but very simple script. It's a great film for kids--especially because of its healthy messages and an unusually strong religious message for a Disney film. Well worth seeing for all ages."
60,tt0352248,1,"Truly inspiring story of James J. Braddock. This story is about more than boxing. It is about a man and his wife trying to raise a family in the tough times of the 1920s. And the integrity and example he shows his children in those times. Russell Crowe, Renee Zellweger and Paul Giamatti are just part of this incredible cast. It is a must see."
61,tt0352248,9,"The dilemma: I hate boxing movies; I love Russell Crowe movies. I've already seen ""Million Dollar Baby"" and ""Raging Bull"" this year, and accidentally watched part of one of the ""son of Rocky"" serial movies on a Saturday afternoon. I feel like I am being punched, as Renee' Zellwegger's character Mae Braddock says, and I'm not as tough as these prize fighters.But this one has Russell Crowe in it. And that makes all the difference. It is not that Renee Zellwegger and Paul Giamatti, Paddy Considine, Bruce McGill and Craig Bierko, among others, give less than stellar performances: they all live up to their justifiably great reputations. You have to believe they are at the top of their game. But for all of Russell Crowe's reputation for being ""difficult"", it is hard to think of actors who can equal his personal force on the screen. He is brilliant. Ron Howard has made of the real life of Depression-era prize-fighter James J. Braddock a work of art. The camera work is phenomenal. Without using violins or cliché' pull-back shots showing the numbers of people homeless and in soup lines, Howard makes the Depression a visceral reality with scenes of near-hopeless men at the docks, pleading for a day's work; a stolen salami; Crowe's giving his daughter his breakfast piece of bologna, telling her he dreamed he was full. The bleakness of the times is the graininess and the sepia/greyness of the camera shots; the images are stark but completely descriptive. Crowe as Braddock with hat in hand and tears in his eyes, begging for twenty dollars so he can get his children back into his home, is the personification of pride sacrificed to desperation.

62,tt0352248,1,"Truly inspiring story of James J. Braddock. This story is about more than boxing. It is about a man and his wife trying to raise a family in the tough times of the 1920s. And the integrity and example he shows his children in those times. Russell Crowe, Renee Zellweger and Paul Giamatti are just part of this incredible cast. It is a must see."
63,tt0352248,9,"The dilemma: I hate boxing movies; I love Russell Crowe movies. I've already seen ""Million Dollar Baby"" and ""Raging Bull"" this year, and accidentally watched part of one of the ""son of Rocky"" serial movies on a Saturday afternoon. I feel like I am being punched, as Renee' Zellwegger's character Mae Braddock says, and I'm not as tough as these prize fighters.But this one has Russell Crowe in it. And that makes all the difference. It is not that Renee Zellwegger and Paul Giamatti, Paddy Considine, Bruce McGill and Craig Bierko, among others, give less than stellar performances: they all live up to their justifiably great reputations. You have to believe they are at the top of their game. But for all of Russell Crowe's reputation for being ""difficult"", it is hard to think of actors who can equal his personal force on the screen. He is brilliant. Ron Howard has made of the real life of Depression-era prize-fighter James J. Braddock a work of art. The camera work is phenomenal. Without using violins or cliché' pull-back shots showing the numbers of people homeless and in soup lines, Howard makes the Depression a visceral reality with scenes of near-hopeless men at the docks, pleading for a day's work; a stolen salami; Crowe's giving his daughter his breakfast piece of bologna, telling her he dreamed he was full. The bleakness of the times is the graininess and the sepia/greyness of the camera shots; the images are stark but completely descriptive.

Sure, it's weird looking, but we've seen it before, and back then in films like Edward Scissorhands it had a sense of purpose. Now we're left exploring a CGI wonderland that seems to be without a great deal of wonder. The book revels in its bizarre environs, absurd dialogue and whimsical characters. This film grounds them, drains them of that mystery and leaves us with a colourful but forgettable retread. It seems intent on driving us to a narrative conclusion that few people will have had much stake in through its running time, simply because we're not giving much to care for.With a source material so familiar, even to those whose knowledge is second hand references, there needs to be a degree of innovation (as in Svenkmejer's dark stop-motion version, or the co-opting of Terry Gilliam in to his ""Tideland"" narrative), or else a studious and inspired adaptation that completely returns to Lewis Carroll. What we end up with is a mid-point that fails to get to grips with what enchants people about the Alice story, and another chance to see a beautiful waif walk around twisted, quasi-Gothic landscapes to a score by Danny Elfman.Not that this isn't an enjoyable experience in itself, and as seen in the vast Screen 1 at the Empire it is at times breathtakingly pretty. It's just inessential, and while it may be unfair to expect a classic from a favoured filmmaker every time out, when they tackle something with the pedigree and history of Alice In Wonderland you can't help but hope for something special.

67,tt1014759,2,"I loved ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"" and remember it as an amazing and timeless adventure indeed. Alice wanders around in a world so enigmatic and unstable that you never know what will happen next, and what twist will put Alice in just new trouble, often unintentionally and tragically made worse by her own doing. Now this is all exactly what this movie does not have. After Alice arrives in the new 'underland', you will soon be in on the entire story: It is two sides, good against evil, and Alice is to slay a monster. Not a single second is unexpected. Nor are there any twists. (But even the first minutes are astonishingly wanting any concept: Scenes without any real characters rush by, there is no focus of attention in the opening.) But most of all, my understanding of then brand ""Alice"" is that she originally wanders around a dream land that confronts her with her own self, her anxieties, her shadowy anticipation that things will not be all nice and easy, all taking shape in landscapes, characters and events painted in dream-language. Of this essence, it should be no problem to create a movie that really leaves an impression - let alone, if Tim Burton is in the team. But there is nothing, nothing of this concept in this movie. Instead of joining a charismatic and mature character on the journey through her own dismal, natural instabilities that every one carries inside, the story here is already written, and Alice is only to follow marked footprints. For the only reason that... she is the one foretold to do it. There is merely the most silly 'hollywood-intellectualism', where 'good against evil' must be taken as, like, certainly some sort of metaphor representing all our everyday struggles, and it is so much about decision making and all... I'm devastated. Eventually, Tim Burton has added his potential for design to a movie completely without content. The only metaphor I see is Lewis Carroll appearing at the end in the figure of the Jabberwokie, and Alice, slaying him. Carroll is dead, long live 'Alice does Hollywood'."
68,tt1014759,3,"Sometimes I think that I should like Tim Burton movies more than I do. Don't get me wrong, the man has made some excellent films, such as the masterful Ed Wood. But all too often, despite an agreeable tendency towards visual flamboyance, I leave his films feeling somewhat underwhelmed. Alice in Wonderland is a case in point. It's a movie where CGI effects rule the day. But the trouble is that the true weirdness that is at the heart of this story is not captured at all with all the computer-generated imagery on-screen. Sure it's very efficient and well-designed but like CGI in general, it's far too polished to really strike a chord and convince. There is a distinct lack of wonder in this Wonderland. The otherworldly weirdness is dissipated too by the use of overly-familiar voices to give life to the various denizens of this world, we are left thinking 'Oh that's Stephen Fry, hey isn't that Alan Rickman, I'm sure that's Christopher Lee and isn't that the bloke from Little Britain, etc'. It consistently takes us out of the movie and grounds the characters in a way that is just counter-productive. We want weirdness from an Alice in Wonderland film, not slick CGI and famous voice-over actors.There is also a dangerously cosy predictability at play here too. Tim Burton, Johnny Depp, Danny Elfman – they say familiarity breeds contempt, well that's a bit strong but it IS seriously lacking in surprises and you cannot help think that all three individually talented men could do with taking a break from each other for the good of their careers. Depp's Mad Hatter is pretty uninspired by his standards, while Burton's visuals and Elfman's music are nice but ultimately completely forgettable. I found it very difficult to care for any of the characters in this film, and that is never a good thing. It also meant that the conclusion came across as deeply trite, as we have been given nothing to empathize with. We don't know or have any interest in these characters, so when Alice goes around her extended family one by one imparting her new knowledge onto them, it means nothing. It also doesn't help that the journey to Wonderland has made absolutely no difference at all to the title character's state of mind – at the beginning she does not want to get married to the upper-class chump and at the end she does not want to get married to the upper-class chump. So you are left wondering what exactly was the point?I saw this in 3D and if there is one thing that this film has taught me it's that I am done with this 'new and improved' technology. I sensed it was a gimmick even before I watched Avatar; now I am certain. A bad film is a bad film, and no amount of extra visual depth is going to change that one iota. It's all surface-veneer, and really that's this movie's ultimate problem, there is nothing of interest within the CGI/3D. A great shame, as the source material is undeniably compelling.I realize that I am almost done here but I have not even mentioned the worst thing about the film. What was it? It was when the Mad Hatter and then, subsequently, Alice do a truly cringe-worthy little dance near the end of the film. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I half-expected Britain's Got Talent winners Diversity to pop up in a cameo appearance at this stage and join in with some urban street dancing manoeuvres. That didn't happen. And that is, at least, one saving grace."
101,tt0047803,1,"Really a superb nature documentary, a captivating watch. I can't think of a better film on the wild kingdom. Why isn't this available on video? This is not specifically a film about lions as it's title implies, this is a film about the African wild, untouched, with fascinating looks at the life and times a full variety of species including elephants, rhino's, giraffes, antelope, monkeys, leopards, and more.. Near the beginning, the narrator says; ""This is Africa, The Lions Realm.."" which would have been a more appropriate title. The film covers a lot of different species, and it does so in a way that enables the viewer to both absorb specific insights into the daily existence of individual creatures, while at the same time experience the essence of the wild as a whole.Now admittedly, I love nature and wildlife type shows; and my opinion is that this production made over 50 years ago, is amongst kings of nature films."

69,tt1014759,1,"Here is a tale of two Lewises. One wrote a small but great children's book that still delights, surprises and enchants. The other wrote a large, artistic series of children's books that push Christian sermons at us in the guise of adventure fantasy. The first author, Lewis Carroll, wrote Alice in Wonderland. The second, CS Lewis, wrote the Narnia saga. Here is what happened – in my theory – when the light bulb went on above the head of Linda Woolverton, who wrote the original screenplay for the new Alice in Wonderland.""What if we turn Wonderland into Narnia? What if an older Alice revisits her dream world, now called Underland, and discovers a giant battle in progress between good and evil? We could have a Red Queen's army fighting a White Queen's, a Mad Hatter as saintly mediator, and a lot of Armageddon spectacle sure to bring in the youngsters and spawn a video game.""Thus is Hell born. You cannot believe the dreadfulness of Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland – gifted director takes on gaga script – until you see it. Enchantment has gone that-away. Once down the rabbit hole Alice, played with brave but doomed grace by Australian actress Mia Wasikowska, discovers that her old chums all walk a darkening land bearing Tolkienish/Lewisite names. The dormouse is Mallymkun, the Cheshire cat Chessur, the caterpillar Absolem. Soon the throng is joined by dragons who seem to have come from Avatar. The tea party has 10 seconds to flatter us with incipient charm – its chaotic table and moth-eaten March Hare suggest a Samuel Beckett revamp (that would be a good spin) – before it too is sacrificed to sword, sorcery and showdown. Johnny Depp's Mad Hatter shows promise for a little longer – this actor does deranged innocence better than anyone (Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood) – but finally he too drowns in the Sea of Tacky Bombast."
70,tt1014759,1,"I am shocked by both this movie and my visceral reaction to it. Unlike Avatar, which used the 3D technology as an integral part of the movie, 3D adds nothing to this movie. And frankly, the glasses darken the screen so much that the already dimmed image (thanks to projectors that aren't as bright as they used to be) was pretty bland. Let me state for the record, for anyone who doesn't know, the movie conflates the two books, and adds in Jabberwocky for the hell of it. And back story (19 year old Alice is about to marry the wrong man (she was too old for Lewis Carroll). The Queen of Hearts becomes the Red Queen. And the Knaves of Hearts become a cross between the clone robots for Star Wars:Clone Wars and sow bugs. 1. A bland, blond, Victorian Dorothy Gale lives in Kansas, er, England, and is about to marry a prig. She has recurring nightmares about Oz, er, Wonderland, er, Underland, and falls down the rabbit hole. Unlike The Wizard of Oz, there is really no sense of wonder when she opens the door from her black and white existence (filmed in color, which ruins the supposed effect) to Wonderland. Nor does Alice exhibit and curiosity or joy at being in Wonderland. The actress registers no emotion about anything. 2. Johnny Depp used to be a wonderful actor in quirky films. His movies now resemble the parodies that Carol Burnett used to do on her show. (Sweeney Todd being the exception). He has now ruined to wonderful movies, with a lot of help from Tim Burton: Charlie And The Chocolate Factory was excruciating in its twee-ness. And as with Alice, added too much back story and robbed the original Roald Dahl's original book of both its charm and character, while only emphasizing how amazing the original movie was. This movie adds all of the current techno bells and whistles and still can't compare to Disney's own animated version. 3. Tim Burton used to make interesting movies about interesting people with interesting actors: Ed Wood, Edward Scissorhands (what happened to that Johnny Depp?) More Sweeney, less fantasy, please.4. Why do Anne Hathaway's arms not straighten? What's up with that?EVerything that makes Lewis Carroll Lewis Carroll has been leached out of this movie."
71,tt1014759,1,"It is amazing that they managed to make a remake that is worse than the original IN EVERY ASPECT. This film looks like a B movie, the animation, styling and scenery are flawlessly default and most of the movie visuals looks like the designers downloaded a pack of 3D stock models and colored them a bit. If you watch a showreel of almost ANY decent animation studio you will see much better and creative stuff than this.The direction is ridiculously non-interesting, some short shots are just plain stupid and I have no idea HOW is THIS possible in this budget. There is no rhythm, there are just a bunch of scenes with a little bit of this and a little bit of that. Sound editing is retarded with voices overlapping each other, atmospheric sounds are sometimes loud and sometimes non-existent. At the scene where the Mad Hatter gives a speech and makes a riot in Queen's castle the cheering crowd sound behind his speech is AWFUL! You can download better crowd samples FOR FREE.Music sounds like a bunch of sampled ""ooouuuooo"" shitty, spooky loops of crappy classical music in a default Burton way. Acting is WHATEVER and seems like everything was written and shot in 5 days. The voice dubbing of 3D models is worse than the earliest works of Dreamworks.There is no drama, there is no crescendo, there is no playfulness that makes Alice in WONDERLAND such a powerful story. There is not a shred of IMAGINATION here. I mean, even the opening credits look like they were done in 1 hour. To top it all, the song in the ending credits CANNOT be more cheap and that pathetic attempt of the final ""DANCE"" - some miserable version of a popping' breakdance is disgusting and is on the level of The Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers.Even on a ""woman becoming a powerful individual"" symbolism level the movie as bland as POSSIBLE.Holy ****, this movie is a humongous piece of an even more gigantic, moronic, generic feces that Hollywood is happily sitting in. Join the feast."

Truthfully i wanted to love this movie, I'm a huge Tim Burton/ Johnny Depp fan. But this just didn't do it for me. I came out of the theater wondering if it were just the mediocre script or the director who had failed to meet my expectations. The best part of this movie is probably Johnny Depps portrayal of the mad hatter who truly is mad. However, Mia Wasikowska presents Alice in a dull manner that had me checking my watch every ten or fifteen minutes. Overall this film isn't awful, but at the same time its no masterpiece, for an interesting film to look at I suppose this would be an alright choice, however if you want a great story and compelling acting, you might want to check out something else, because this isn't the movie you're looking for."

The only metaphor I see is Lewis Carroll appearing at the end in the figure of the Jabberwokie, and Alice, slaying him. Carroll is dead, long live 'Alice does Hollywood'."
78,tt1014759,3,"Sometimes I think that I should like Tim Burton movies more than I do. Don't get me wrong, the man has made some excellent films, such as the masterful Ed Wood. But all too often, despite an agreeable tendency towards visual flamboyance, I leave his films feeling somewhat underwhelmed. Alice in Wonderland is a case in point. It's a movie where CGI effects rule the day. But the trouble is that the true weirdness that is at the heart of this story is not captured at all with all the computer-generated imagery on-screen. Sure it's very efficient and well-designed but like CGI in general, it's far too polished to really strike a chord and convince. There is a distinct lack of wonder in this Wonderland. The otherworldly weirdness is dissipated too by the use of overly-familiar voices to give life to the various denizens of this world, we are left thinking 'Oh that's Stephen Fry, hey isn't that Alan Rickman, I'm sure that's Christopher Lee and isn't that the bloke from Little Britain, etc'. It consistently takes us out of the movie and grounds the characters in a way that is just counter-productive. We want weirdness from an Alice in Wonderland film, not slick CGI and famous voice-over actors.There is also a dangerously cosy predictability at play here too. Tim Burton, Johnny Depp, Danny Elfman – they say familiarity breeds contempt, well that's a bit strong but it IS seriously lacking in surprises and you cannot help think that all three individually talented men could do with taking a break from each other for the good of their careers. Depp's Mad Hatter is pretty uninspired by his standards, while Burton's visuals and Elfman's music are nice but ultimately completely forgettable. I found it very difficult to care for any of the characters in this film, and that is never a good thing. It also meant that the conclusion came across as deeply trite, as we have been given nothing to empathize with. We don't know or have any interest in these characters, so when Alice goes around her extended family one by one imparting her new knowledge onto them, it means nothing. It also doesn't help that the journey to Wonderland has made absolutely no difference at all to the title character's state of mind – at the beginning she does not want to get married to the upper-class chump and at the end she does not want to get married to the upper-class chump. So you are left wondering what exactly was the point?I saw this in 3D and if there is one thing that this film has taught me it's that I am done with this 'new and improved' technology. I sensed it was a gimmick even before I watched Avatar; now I am certain. A bad film is a bad film, and no amount of extra visual depth is going to change that one iota. It's all surface-veneer, and really that's this movie's ultimate problem, there is nothing of interest within the CGI/3D. A great shame, as the source material is undeniably compelling.I realize that I am almost done here but I have not even mentioned the worst thing about the film. What was it? It was when the Mad Hatter and then, subsequently, Alice do a truly cringe-worthy little dance near the end of the film. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I half-expected Britain's Got Talent winners Diversity to pop up in a cameo appearance at this stage and join in with some urban street dancing manoeuvres. That didn't happen. And that is, at least, one saving grace."
79,tt1014759,1,"Here is a tale of two Lewises. One wrote a small but great children's book that still delights, surprises and enchants. The other wrote a large, artistic series of children's books that push Christian sermons at us in the guise of adventure fantasy. The first author, Lewis Carroll, wrote Alice in Wonderland. The second, CS Lewis, wrote the Narnia saga. Here is what happened – in my theory – when the light bulb went on above the head of Linda Woolverton, who wrote the original screenplay for the new Alice in Wonderland.""What if we turn Wonderland into Narnia? What if an older Alice revisits her dream world, now called Underland, and discovers a giant battle in progress between good and evil? We could have a Red Queen's army fighting a White Queen's, a Mad Hatter as saintly mediator, and a lot of Armageddon spectacle sure to bring in the youngsters and spawn a video game.""Thus is Hell born. You cannot believe the dreadfulness of Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland – gifted director takes on gaga script – until you see it. Enchantment has gone that-away. Once down the rabbit hole Alice, played with brave but doomed grace by Australian actress Mia Wasikowska, discovers that her old chums all walk a darkening land bearing Tolkienish/Lewisite names. The dormouse is Mallymkun, the Cheshire cat Chessur, the caterpillar Absolem. Soon the throng is joined by dragons who seem to have come from Avatar. The tea party has 10 seconds to flatter us with incipient charm – its chaotic table and moth-eaten March Hare suggest a Samuel Beckett revamp (that would be a good spin) – before it too is sacrificed to sword, sorcery and showdown. Johnny Depp's Mad Hatter shows promise for a little longer – this actor does deranged innocence better than anyone (Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood) – but finally he too drowns in the Sea of Tacky Bombast."
80,tt1014759,1,"I am shocked by both this movie and my visceral reaction to it. Unlike Avatar, which used the 3D technology as an integral part of the movie, 3D adds nothing to this movie. And frankly, the glasses darken the screen so much that the already dimmed image (thanks to projectors that aren't as bright as they used to be) was pretty bland. Let me state for the record, for anyone who doesn't know, the movie conflates the two books, and adds in Jabberwocky for the hell of it. And back story (19 year old Alice is about to marry the wrong man (she was too old for Lewis Carroll). The Queen of Hearts becomes the Red Queen. And the Knaves of Hearts become a cross between the clone robots for Star Wars:Clone Wars and sow bugs. 1. A bland, blond, Victorian Dorothy Gale lives in Kansas, er, England, and is about to marry a prig. She has recurring nightmares about Oz, er, Wonderland, er, Underland, and falls down the rabbit hole. Unlike The Wizard of Oz, there is really no sense of wonder when she opens the door from her black and white existence (filmed in color, which ruins the supposed effect) to Wonderland. Nor does Alice exhibit and curiosity or joy at being in Wonderland. The actress registers no emotion about anything. 2. Johnny Depp used to be a wonderful actor in quirky films. His movies now resemble the parodies that Carol Burnett used to do on her show. (Sweeney Todd being the exception). He has now ruined to wonderful movies, with a lot of help from Tim Burton: Charlie And The Chocolate Factory was excruciating in its twee-ness. And as with Alice, added too much back story and robbed the original Roald Dahl's original book of both its charm and character, while only emphasizing how amazing the original movie was. This movie adds all of the current techno bells and whistles and still can't compare to Disney's own animated version. 3. Tim Burton used to make interesting movies about interesting people with interesting actors: Ed Wood, Edward Scissorhands (what happened to that Johnny Depp?) More Sweeney, less fantasy, please.4. Why do Anne Hathaway's arms not straighten? What's up with that?EVerything that makes Lewis Carroll Lewis Carroll has been leached out of this movie."
81,tt1014759,1,"It is amazing that they managed to make a remake that is worse than the original IN EVERY ASPECT. This film looks like a B movie, the animation, styling and scenery are flawlessly default and most of the movie visuals looks like the designers downloaded a pack of 3D stock models and colored them a bit. If you watch a showreel of almost ANY decent animation studio you will see much better and creative stuff than this.The direction is ridiculously non-interesting, some short shots are just plain stupid and I have no idea HOW is THIS possible in this budget. There is no rhythm, there are just a bunch of scenes with a little bit of this and a little bit of that. Sound editing is retarded with voices overlapping each other, atmospheric sounds are sometimes loud and sometimes non-existent. At the scene where the Mad Hatter gives a speech and makes a riot in Queen's castle the cheering crowd sound behind his speech is AWFUL! You can download better crowd samples FOR FREE.Music sounds like a bunch of sampled ""ooouuuooo"" shitty, spooky loops of crappy classical music in a default Burton way. Acting is WHATEVER and seems like everything was written and shot in 5 days. The voice dubbing of 3D models is worse than the earliest works of Dreamworks.There is no drama, there is no crescendo, there is no playfulness that makes Alice in WONDERLAND such a powerful story. There is not a shred of IMAGINATION here. I mean, even the opening credits look like they were done in 1 hour. To top it all, the song in the ending credits CANNOT be more cheap and that pathetic attempt of the final ""DANCE"" - some miserable version of a popping' breakdance is disgusting and is on the level of The Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers.Even on a ""woman becoming a powerful individual"" symbolism level the movie as bland as POSSIBLE.Holy ****, this movie is a humongous piece of an even more gigantic, moronic, generic feces that Hollywood is happily sitting in. Join the feast."
82,tt1014759,6,"Adding a little bit of a background story and a few more characters to Alice's adventures didn't do as much as i thought it would for the story. Truthfully i wanted to love this movie, I'm a huge Tim Burton/ Johnny Depp fan. But this just didn't do it for me. I came out of the theater wondering if it were just the mediocre script or the director who had failed to meet my expectations. The best part of this movie is probably Johnny Depps portrayal of the mad hatter who truly is mad. However, Mia Wasikowska presents Alice in a dull manner that had me checking my watch every ten or fifteen minutes. Overall this film isn't awful, but at the same time its no masterpiece, for an interesting film to look at I suppose this would be an alright choice, however if you want a great story and compelling acting, you might want to check out something else, because this isn't the movie you're looking for."

84,tt0045197,7,"I remember as a small lad seeing this on Walt Disney's hour television show where he regularly segmented his feature films for broadcast. Unfortunately this Robin Hood gets overlooked next to Errol Flynn's and the silent with Douglas Fairbanks, Sr. but it has enough merit to stand on its own.Richard Todd is a dashing Robin Hood and he was at the height of his career when he did this film for Walt Disney. Todd was a fine performer and should have had a much bigger career than he did.The cast is filled out with a fine group of British performers. Two in my opinion really stand out. Peter Finch gets his first real exposure to American audiences as the villainous Sheriff of Nottingham. He probably had the biggest career of all the cast members.Secondly the booming James Robertson Justice as Little John is never bad in any film he was ever in. The classic battle between Robin Hood and Little John with staffs on a log bridge was never done better.During the 1950s this version also had competition from television where Richard Greene had a successful series for about seven years. The TV series was a good one, but this film doesn't have to yield to it either.A fine adventure film, the kind just not being made any more."
91,tt0046387,8,"This is a remake of the great 1922 silent film When Knighthood Was In Flower that starred Marion Davies as Princess Mary Tudor, sister of Henry VIII of England. Glynis Johns essays the part here and her verbal duels with James Robertson Justice as Henry VIII are what gives this film it's spark. Richard Todd is a fine and dashing Charles Brandon, object of Mary's affections.It's a quaint tale for today's audiences which is now used to seeing royalty marry commoners. But back in the 16th century that wasn't done. Just entertaining the thought could get you clapped in irons. But the story of Charles Brandon and Mary Tudor is one of the great romantic tales of English royalty.Charles Brandon is a soldier of fortune who catches the eye of Princess Mary Tudor while at Henry VIII's court. Henry's idea is to get an alliance going with France by offering up his sister as the second wife of the aged Louis XII. We also have the Duke of Buckingham as the constable of England who's got his own plans concerning Mary. Mary does go to France and marries Louis XII. But inside of a year she's a royal widow. This being a Disney film and such things are not dealt with there, but it is clearly indicated that the young princess wore the old king out in every conceivable way, as might have been her plan in the first place.Richard Todd and James Robertson Justice are doing their second film for Disney having both been in the earlier Robin Hood. Todd was at the height of his career and it's a pity he faded out in the sixties. He had the looks and charisma and should have been a lot bigger.That booming voice of James Robertson Justice is a treat to listen to in every film he's in. It was years later that Henry VIII was busy changing wives and religions and chopping off heads. Here he's a merry king as he was reputed to be in those years of his reign. James Robertson Justice gives a delightful interpretation.One of Disney's better products and highly recommended."
92,tt0046387,9,"Amazingly, although this film is 62 years old, having come out when I was a teenager, and stars a load of some of my favorite English actors (Glynis Johns, James Robertson Justice and Michael Gough, to name only three), I had never seen it until tonight. I was absolutely amazed at how delightful it was, how great and authentic every scene in it looked, how seriously the actors took their very excellent dialogue - it's a bit more of a comedy than anything else, but it has its dramatic moments - and just the general air of intelligence that permeated what was, of course, a Disney film primarily intended for young audiences. Yet much in the screenplay was quite adult, perhaps most especially Mary Tudor's idea of getting the old French King (and her new husband) to imbibe liberally of the wine at their wedding festivities in order to incapacitate him and not have to consummate their marriage that night. That may not be very much in 2015, but in 1953 it was nearly licentious and quite a great deal to put into a Disney film meant primarily for kids. Of course, the trick here is that if one accepts the overly romantic nature of the film, it is one that will appeal to most intelligent adults, too, if only due to the excellence of the dialogue in the hands of Johns and Justice. And at the start I actually thought Michael Gough was going to play somebody truly noble - Michael Gough, noble? - but by the middle of the film he was deep into his usual villainy; one should never trust Michael Gough any more than one might have trusted Victor Jory a decade or two earlier! Anyway, the wrestling scene, the Mary Tudor ball and the dance introduced into it, the hunting scene, etc. looked totally authentic to me, whether they really were or not, and remember folks, this is all make-believe and made to be enjoyed rather than examined too closely. All in all, I think this has immediately become my favorite Disney live-action film (certainly of the ""costume-variety"" ones) thanks to the wonderful give-and-take of the dialogue. I think it achieves 100% of what was intended by its makers, and it's hard to find fault with that!"

The real highlight is a breathtaking 2'25"" confrontation in which a large female wasp subdues and paralyzes a tarantula with her stinger. The film also features beautiful botanical time lapse photography in brilliant color. The ""Best Documentary Oscar"" was created specifically for this film and it was the first recipient of the award.

Some of the footage is manipulated for a jokey effect, but why complain when it is such a beautifully assembled picture? Colorful and entertaining, it's the perfect primer for children.

95,tt0046246,9,"This Walt Disney (early, when Walt Disney Production was synonymous with wholesome family fare - poor Walt!) film, was actually part of a trilogy contracted with British actors Richard Todd and James Robertson Justice (The Sword and the Rose & The Story of Robin Hood and His Merrie Men were the other two). The lovely Glynis Johns, who plays Rob's wife, portrays a charming Mary Tudor in the Sword and the Rose, but is absent from 'Robin Hood'. Joan Rice is delightful as Maid Marion, but ....Admittedly, one shouldn't substitute 'Highland Rogue' for a documentary on Scottish history of the period. However, there is more than enough accuracy to explain the attitudes and conflicts of the time.Richard Todd shows, clearly, why he was one of the top British film stars of his time and why he was a popular North American import for both stage and screen . He was one of the most passionately animated actors to achieve leading man status. His dark good looks, range of expression, and obvious athleticism (he served as a paratrooper in WWII) complemented his energetic performances.Those who, after watching him, have wondered why he didn't have even greater success in North America, should remember two things: Britain, aflame with patriotic fervor after the war, had a very strong film industry of its own; therefore, many actors felt no desire to join Hollywood's 'British Colony'. Also, Todd fell slightly short, pardon the pun, of North America's standard for romantic leading men.For those concerned about coarse language, explicit sex, or graphic violence when selecting family viewing - this is a keeper. The historic struggle, warm interaction between the stars, and humour should satisfy the more mature members, while the bright colours and action sequences should appeal to all.I first saw this movie about 45 years ago and 3 scenes stayed with me until 'my good woman' was able to find a copy for me last year. (Since I watch it every month, she uses it as one of her arguments when she feels a need to remind me why I should appreciate her so much!) I also heartily recommend the other two movies from the trilogy as wonderful family viewing."
96,tt0046246,7,"The third and last of his British made films with Richard Todd is Rob Roy: The Highland Rogue. As per a Disney family audience it's a lot more upbeat than the Nineties version of this same tale that starred Liam Neeson.It's after the 1715 uprising and James Robertson Justice as the Duke of Argyll wants to bring peace to Scotland as he's figured out the Stuarts ain't coming back. But his aide Lord Montrose has a wholly different agenda going and it involves a special if unspecified grudge he has against the MacGregor Clan as headed by Richard Todd.Anyway in many attempts they just can't seem to capture Todd or intimidate the MacGregors. The Earl of Montrose is played by Michael Gough and his bloodthirsty aide is played with special relish by Geoffrey Keen.Rob Roy is not quite up to the excellence of Robin Hood and The Sword and the Rose, but Richard Todd is earnest and athletic and every inch a Scottish hero. There was definitely a special eye for the customs and mores of Eighteenth Century Scotland in the making of Rob Roy. And it holds up well after over half a century."
97,tt0046246,6,"Walt Disney's follow-up to THE STORY OF ROBIN HOOD AND HIS MERRIE MEN (1952) is this similar epic about another legendary outlaw (emanating from Scotland this time around). He is once again played by Irishman Richard Todd (who has just passed away at the venerable age of 90) and the film even re-unites the actor with his three co-stars from yet another period outing from the Disney Studios, THE SWORD AND THE ROSE (1953), namely Glynis Johns, James Robertson Justice and Michael Gough. For some reason, the film is fairly maligned (awarded a measly *1/2 by the ""Leonard Maltin Film Guide""!) but I rather enjoyed it, while readily admitting to be the least of Disney's three colorful adventures derived from the pages of English history. In traditional Disney fashion, the familiar events were simplified (though by no means rendered juvenile, as would often prove the case later) but there is enough sprawling action and engrossing drama – to say nothing of the beautiful scenery captured in gleaming Technicolor – to please most audiences. Similarly, characterization for this type of larger-than-life fare is pretty much standard but, given careful casting all round, it emerges as forceful rather than clichéd; besides, at a terse 81 minutes, the film has little chance of outstaying its welcome. Incidentally, I had found the flabby, oddly uninvolving and ill-cast 1995 remake (which had garnered critical praise and at least one top Oscar nod back in the day) a major disappointment on my sole viewing so far!"

Splendidly acted throughout, particularly by James Robertson Justice (as the sympathetic Campbell), Michael Gough and Geoffrey Keen (two wonderful villains), and Eric Pohlmann (a truly charismatic performance  one of his best  as King George), ""Rob Roy"" emerges as a rousing adventure yarn with plenty of swashbuckling excitement, hair's breadth escapes, and even a bit of humor and romance.

It's also giraffes, elephants, baboons, hippos, ostriches, wildebeests, and many other animals. The lions do return from time to time. It ends with a plague of locusts.There is no denying the beauty of these animals and Disney is there to capture it. The cinematography is great especially considering the era. Nature docs don't take another giant leap until the days of HD. The most questionable narration is the little bird cleaning up the hippos.

Still, though the movie has its heart in the right place, the Hispanic text has been smoothed over for American audiences, resulting in a coy, somewhat stilted slice of white bread.

I enjoyed the mini adventure feel that this has to it, as we follow Pablito on the run.Pablito is portrayed by Andrés Velázquez. He isn't anything special, yet I still care for the character thanks to the likeable nature of Velázquez; similar case for Laila Maley's Celita.Pedro Armendáriz and Rodolfo Acosta are solid in their roles of Torres and Chato, but it's Joseph Calleia who stands out as Padre; becoming a father figure for Pablito, which comes across as charming.The only negative here is the questionable animal welfare. I know nowadays you can make an animal do things without putting them in danger, I just doubt that was as easy a thing to do back in 1955. I don't see any horror stories online though, so perhaps it's not as bad as it looks at times.It's a rather short film, one that probably could've been expanded and built upon.

110,tt0048304,5,"It came as a surprise to me that ""The Littlest Outlaw"" is still circulating in home video, while ""Song of the South"" has been denied a proper home video release in the United States, for matters related to ""political correctness"", for while one is accused of racism and left in the vaults, the other is free of critique in spite of its scenes showing cruelty to animals. Not that I am for the banning of these films, Nazi movies or comedies with white actors playing African- Americans with black pancake, because I understand that all these products have to be seen as signs of different times or modes of thought in mankind's existence on Earth, but this Disney double standard seemed to me a good example of entrepreneurial false morality. In this times when bullfighting is almost universally condemned, the last act of ""The Littlest Outlaw"" is built around one such scene in which animals (and humans, including a toreador who seems to be actually gored by a bull) are hurt for the pleasure of the masses. Unfortunately this sequence is perhaps the only segment in which ""The Littlest Outlaw"" is less insipid and becomes vivid, because otherwise it is a routine melodrama with equestrian choreography and a little comedy here and there. The Mexican locale is merely an excuse, for the story can happen anywhere, but in the end that intent for narrating something ""latino"" proved to be the worst aspect of the movie. By 1955 Mexican director Roberto Gavaldón had made fine melodramas, including ""The Kneeling Goddess"", ""In the Palm of Your Hand"", ""Night Falls"", ""The Three Perfect Married Women"" and powerful rural tales as ""Rosauro Castro"", ""The Shawl of Soledad"" and ""Green Shadow""; while there were more appreciable works to come after this Disney production: """"Ash Wednesday"", ""Macario"", ""Rosa Blanca"" and ""The Golden Cockerel"". But in this tale of boy and horse wandering through the country side, conceived by producer Larry Lansburgh (whose filmography shows a strong liking for animal movies), Gavaldón could not avoid the Disney formula, with a saccharine relationship between boy and horse, odd and funny secondary characters, a silly song called ""Doroteo"", and a kid that hardly looks as a rural Mexican boy of indigenous ancestry, who would look more comfortable in a suburb of Mexico City. Pedro Armendáriz and Rodolfo Acosta play the rude men they used to portray in their sleep, the rest of the Mexican actors are efficient and likable, and everybody seems to enjoy what they were doing. I am sorry to say that I could not share their enthusiasm."
111,tt0049279,8,"As I have mentioned previously there are a limited number of commercial films about the American Civil War. Most people will instantly say GONE WITH THE WIND, but much of that film deals with the ante - bellum South before war begins, and an hour and a half deals with Georgia under Reconstruction into the late 1870s. There is the twin films GODS AND GENERALS about the rise and fall of the magnificent military partnership of Robert E. Lee and Thomas Jonathan ""Stonewall"" Jackson, and GETTYSBURG. There is also THE HORSE SOLDIER about Grierson's Raid into Mississippi during the Vicksburg Campaign. There was the ""Shiloh"" segment of the HOW THE WEST WAS WON about the battle there. There was THE RAID about the attack of the Confederate Raiders from Canada on St. Albans, Vermont in the summer of 1864. Quantrell and his raiders appear in several films, most notably DARK COMMAND. There is also the prototype for GONE WITH THE WIND about the collapse of southern society called SO RED THE ROSE.It is notable that the emphasis is on raiders from the southern states or with southern sympathies (William Quantrell or Cantrell, or the St. Alban Raiders). But there are two films on one incident where the raiders were Northern raiders - the raid led by John J. Andrews in his celebrated February 1862 snatch of the locomotive ""The General"" in an attempt to damage southern railroad tracks and bridges in Georgia and Tennessee. The incident has ended up being the most discussed military operation of the land forces of the Civil War in film. First it was immortalized in what may have been the funniest war comedy ever made, Buster Keaton's THE GENERAL (1927). But Keaton, using the Andrews raid as a start, changed the story by having the Union raiders succeed for awhile in bringing the Confederate locomotive to Union lines and has his southern hero ""Johnny Gray"" steal it back. Unfortunately, Andrews and his raiders never had such luck. Indeed their fates were quite savage in reality.This 1956 film by Walt Disney is not as well known as Keaton's classic, but it come closer to being factually correct. It shows the planning of the scheme by Northern spy Andrews and his picked crew, how they stole the ""General"" in a surprise act when the train was getting refilled, and how they ran it for a twenty mile chase until the train reached the end of it's coal supply. Here the reality of the story gets more savage. Andrews and his men fled into the forests of Tennessee, and were tracked down by Southern troops who recaptured most of them. Andrews and several others were hung. The other captured raiders were sent to prison camps.For people who only think of Fess Parker as Walt Disney's ""Davy Crockett"" may be fascinated to see he played another role for that producer - and did a good job at it. And like the last episode of the series about the ""King of the Wild Frontier"", Parker's character died heroically, but violently again."
112,tt0049733,1,"A Walt Disney TRUE-LIFE ADVENTURE Feature. Ants, bizarre ocean dwellers & the remarkable history of the honeybee are among the SECRETS OF LIFE revealed in this splendid documentary. Time-lapse photography is highlighted in a fascinating bloom bolero' sequence. The film ends with eye-popping views of volcanoes. `This is an authentic story of nature's secret world...of her strange and intricate designs for survival...and her many methods of perpetuating life. The intimate and unusual scenes were made possible through the development of new photographic techniques...and through the skill and patience of many scientist-photographers.' Winston Hibler is the narrator."
113,tt0049733,7,"Disney True Life Adventure chronicles the lives of plants and animals using special photography techniques. We watch plants grow through time lapse and we see animals do their things thanks to micro photography and special cameras. Its pure eye candy. To be sure you can see similar stuff on cable TV's Animal Planet or the Discovery Channel, but there is still something neat about seeing the ""hidden"" world of nature right before you that never gets dull. Lets face it, in the 50 years since this film was first released we still haven't stopped marveling at ants up close, fish shooting their prey, and the motion of stationary plants. The photography here is incredible and in most cases hasn't been improved upon despite five decades of technological improvements. No matter how jaded a nature documentary snob you think you are, odds are you'll find something here to make you go ""Oh Wow"". Granted the film isn't perfect. The opening sequence about geology isn't all that great (I'm guessing its there just to book end the film with the volcano at the end) and the narration leaves a great deal to be desired, but it doesn't matter since the animals and plants in motion are enough to over come the poor extras. Absolutely worth a look for anyone who likes nature."
114,tt0049733,1,"Anyone of a certain age can certainly recall being dropped off at the movies or gathered together on a Sunday evening at 7:00 to watch ""Disney"" on NBC TV, and often, they would show one of these engaging documentaries that got children interested in the world around them. I recall sitting in the theater watching ""The Living Desert"" years ago and then later seeing it on TV, and the thrill it gave me. As an adult, I was upset by the lack of these types of films, although ""Animals are Beautiful People"" is one that came out that was worth seeing over and over again. On home video, many of these films made their way out, and the most recent of these that caught my attention was Warner Brothers' 1954 3-D ""Animal World"" that gave a quick overview of the history of evolution and how animals and man came to be based on scientific research, in a way that made it both educational and fun, and certainly films that in the right schools can be shown today to engage the students to want to learn more.This rather short documentary doesn't overstay its welcome, but I would certainly have welcomed another 10-20 minutes based on how entertained and interested I was in the areas this did cover, mainly the insect world and the goings on in the bottom of the beautiful briny sea. Using a combination of animation and live action footage (sped up through photographic special effects), the audience gets to see the worlds of vegetation, how alive and animal like they almost are, moving much slower than insects, but often seeming to be much more than just your every day ordinary plant. This shows the various vegetations at their stages of life, showing how forest fires can actually bring about new life, how seedlings move to create new plants and trees, and the impact of natural events on everything around them. The world of the insects are fascinating, from the bees who instinctively know exactly what their life will consist of and how to go about it, to the ants who become very territorial, even facing a large snake like worm that invades their lair. Along with the underwater segment, these scenes almost make these creatures to become monster like, something which obviously influenced film makers of the 1950's with the enormous number of ""creature features"" that came out during this time. I hope never to come across the notorious ""cobra plant"" that attracts bees and never lets them out, although a bee eating its way out of a closing flower at night is fascinating to watch in the sped up motion of the photography. Under the water, there are some other deliciously monster like animals: fish who use a worm like appendage to fool unsuspecting passerby smaller fish (swallowing them whole then burbing after gorging), fish who spawn on the beach and must get back into the water before the tide goes away, male crabs with one huge claw used to attract a mate, and the decorator crab who pulls leaves off of ocean vegetation to disguise itself in order to catch a meal. The funniest is the footage of the spitting fish who shoots water from underneath the ocean at insects resting above then gobbles em' up the minute they hit the water. This shows how entire continents are changed simply through evolution, the impact of volcanoes and how nature often will re-invent itself, yet how much it will stay the same. That makes this fascinating viewing for ""children of every age"". It is an absolute must see, one that will keep your kids or students transfixed and want to see more of these true-life adventures that stand the test of time more than 60 years after being made. Unlike Godzilla or other movie monsters, these aren't men in rubber suits: these are the real deal."
115,tt0049733,9,I don't know when I first saw this Disney documentary. I certainly remember seeing some of the time-lapse photography of plants and the closeup insect footage although it's possible that Disney repurposed them in later movies. It's very probable that I saw this in grade school.The movie starts with a bit of animation about the birth of the world and animations form breaks between sections of the movie. The time-lapse photography is memorable. The seeds moving around is a wonder every time. The montage is beautiful. Winston Hibler's narration is old timey. The close up footage of insects are amazing. This is an early nature film from Disney. It is truly the wonderful world of Disney. This is definitely educational but also beautiful to behold. The ants battle is gruesome. There is no Disneyfying the dog eat dog nature of the world. It is eat or be eaten. This movie doesn't shy away.
116,tt0049945,8,"This is one of several westerns that the Walt Disney studio tailored for Fess Parker in the years immediately following Davy Crockett's success. The first half hour is an enjoyable but relatively routine wagon trail tale, involving a stalwart boy (David Stollery, of Spin and Marty fame) who, like the legendary John Colter, must run from hostile Indians on foot. The action-oriented first half culminates in a rugged shootout that action-western fans will enjoy. In the minds of many, Westward Ho slows down there as the train arrives in Fort Laramie and no further big battles occur. In fact, this is where the movie takes off dramatically, promoting the sort of racial tolerance and mutual acceptance so essential to the Disney vision. Parker is a doctor, and along with a Lakota medicine man (Iron Eyes Cody), helps a dying Indian boy. ""Two medicines are better than one"" is the message, and a beautiful one at that, suggesting that mutual cooperation is indeed possible between the races. Fess even gets to sing several sings, and one of them, ""Wringle Wrangle,"" became a top ten hit. This is a forgotten treat, waiting to be rediscovered."
117,tt0049945,6,This western was Disney's attempt to cash in on the popularity of Fess Parker and the Mousketeers. The lean story is about a wagon train that is obliged to pass through Indian country during a westward trek. The attack on the train is done in fine style by Yakima Canutt. The battle is intense and the Indians display expert horsemanship but seem more content to capture horses than to lift hair. Parker comes through as the hero later in the film as a doctor who must match skills with a medicine man to save a boy's life. The movie has the usual Disney gloss and fine western vistas but seems self-conscious and mannered. The Mouseketeers maintain their wholesomeness through the stress of the battle and tensions at the fort. Kathleen Crowley is pretty as Parker's romantic interest.
118,tt0049945,6,"How well I remember seeing this film in theaters when it first opened back in 1956. For those of you not old enough to remember the Mickey Mouse Club attained a cult following among juveniles back then. So Westward Ho The Wagons had a built in audience before a dime was made at the theater box office.The dividing line between Walt Disney's television work and his theatrical work was invisible, both supported the other. As it happened back then his theatrical releases eventually were part of his Wonderful World of Color show and the films were built with the places obvious for commercial break.This was never more true than with Westward Ho The Wagon. In fact it's like two separate films spliced together, the better for a two part extravaganza on TV. The first part consists of the Oregon bound settlers fending off a Pawnee attack until they can get through a canyon gap. Once through they're in Sioux country where Chief Iron Eyes Cody has taken a fancy to little Karen Pendleton of the Mouseketeers because his medicine man says that blonds are scarce and little blonds bring good luck. Her sister Kathleen Crowley has a big divergence of opinion on that premise.In addition to the Mouseketeers playing children on the Oregon bound wagon train, the train has Fess Parker fresh from Davy Crockett as the scout. No doubt Parker's presence brought a few dollars in, he was another icon at this height of his career.Playing the head of the wagon train and father of several Mouseketeers is George Reeves who was making his final attempt to escape typecasting as Superman. Reeves wears a beard, the better to hide his well known face and be accepted as another actor in a role rather than in his iconic character from those days.Despite being episodic Westward Ho The Wagons holds up very well for today's audience if it were only seen. But Disney's old products for the most part are in the vault while we see endless reruns of Zack and Cody."
119,tt0049945,5,"Fess Parker is his usual stolid self leading wagon train to Oregon, crossing paths with bloodthirsty Pawnee tribe. Fans were attracted to Parker's workmanlike acting style and amiable, almost-shy personality. He's a headliner simply by default. This Disney film has nice outdoor scenery, some strong scenes of survival and a good supporting cast (including hammy, amusing Sebastian Cabot and a few Mouseketeers); otherwise, it's a formula-bound, banal sagebrush saga. B-grade director William Beaudine does his usual anonymous work behind the camera. Tom Blackburn adapted his screenplay from Mary Jane Carr's book, ""Children of the Covered Wagon"" (also the film's pre-production title). ** from ****"
120,tt0049945,8,"there was no Dracula in this western. so i guess Beaudine fanz might be a tad disappointed. this also wasn't terribly exciting either and sort of deserves it's ""westward ho-hum the wagguns"" rep, and it is a little derogatory in it's depiction of the United States/native American conflict, but still, i enjoyed it immensely and found it very entertaining. then again, i'm partial to old school Disney films and i also happen to LOVE Fess Parker. so i think i'm bias here in my criticism.is there any such thing as a quasi-musical? if so, then i think this is one. there is not just one or two songs here, but at least four that i can think of, so i think this qualifies as practically a musical. not quite, but almost. it's also a reminder, that Fess Parker was really the last of the true singing cowboys. something Fessy is never given much credit for and something people who berate the film needlessly seem to forget. it's the kind of western where the singing cow dude is the draw, not the action sequences. if you're in this for the action sequences, you'll be a bit disappointed.the attitude toward native Americanos needs to be discussed and mentioned here too. sometimes the depiction of Indians is good and somewhat accurate, other times it's just plain racist and arrogant with the white settlers calling the Indians savages and ignorant heathens. not good unca Walt. but i can't exactly say John Ford's film masterpiece 'Stagecoach' is exactly sympathetic to the native American conflict either. but basically the attitude here is ""whitey good. Indian bad and in need of big heap spankum"".mostly i bought this movie because of Fessy and the Meeskateers. Doreen Tracey plays BoBo Stephen. no academy award here but she plays a BoBo very well. Cubby O'Brien and Karen are here also for a little added scrumptious cuteness. Marty, of 'Spin & Marty' Disney fame, basically plays himself. Tommy is here fer the ol' role call too. i miss Annette though. Annette would have really livened things up. she could have sung a duet with Fessy."
130,tt0050837,8,"There are a lot of very interesting nature shots in this movie, some quite beautiful. It is not an animated movie, like Bambi, and does not approach the truly remarkable beauty of that movie. But there's a lot to enjoy here, if you ignore the one musical number about couples, which is not at the level of the rest of the movie.I would say that this might not be appropriate for small children, but then, as I still remember almost 60 years later, seeing Bambi was very frightening for little children as well. There are a LOT of scenes of animals hunting other animals, and sometimes they catch them. There is no focus on limbs being ripped off corpses or anything gruesome like that, of course, but you do see wildcats carrying off rabbits, etc. If you feel this would unduly upset your child, you might want to have a talk about nature's ways before letting your child see it."
131,tt0050837,8,"Our cat, who never pays any attention to the television, watched this film with great interest for about the first hour! He even moved to sit right in front of the TV. It dragged a bit near the end, but was worth watching."
121,tt0050567,1,"When I was 7 years old I was taken by my older brother to the local 'flea pit' to see a double feature, the main film was 'Bambi' and the supporting film was 'Johnny Tremain'. Being only an ankle biter at the time, the film I was looking forward to seeing was Bambi, I had never heard of Johnny Tremain and had no interest whatsoever in watching it, however, once the lights went down in the cinema and the film started, I found myself enchanted by what I was watching, being an English boy I knew little or nothing about the American War of Independence, I had never heard of the Boston Tea Party and had always presumed that Britain and America had always been on friendly terms, we were never taught about it at school, which is hardly surprising I guess, seeing as the Colonists took on the might of the British military and won! The story of Johnny Tremain was told in such a simple and enjoyable way, in a way that only Disney could tell a story, that even a 7 year old English kid could understand the plot and historical background. It is 52 years now since I saw the film but it made a such a lasting impression on me that I can still remember the words to the song (which admittedly being a very short song with few words, is probably not saying much). I would assume that to todays youngsters this film would prove to be dated and uninteresting, after all there is no sex,no bad language and the violence is sanitised, but it was made in a time when values were a lot different and Disney was the king of family movies. Times have changed, but for all the digital special effects and hype, I for one, reckon you can't beat a good old fashioned movie telling its story in an uncomplicated way, standing or falling on plot, direction and good acting."
122,tt0050567,1,"Disney makes another book-movie in 1957 with ""Johnny Tremain,"" based on Esther Forbes' award-winning novel of the same name. It is about a boy named Johnny Tremain, who worked as an apprentice until his hand touched hot molten silver. Now he had to find a new job, until he decided to go into battle. This had taken place in Boston back during such wonderful events in history like the Boston Tea Party and the invasion of the British (One if by land, Two if by sea).I have read this book in Calvert School back in 7th grade, I believe. It was such a wonderful book; my mom even enjoyed it, too. Our library had a classroom version of this movie on DVD (although a regular version can also be purchased), and we had just checked that movie out and we enjoyed it so.""Johnny Tremain"" is real good Disney, indeed: a great book made into a great movie portraying terrific American history.Ten stars."

124,tt0050837,1,Perri is a beautiful movie. It features wonderfully developed characters and some excellent cinematography.

This superb family film was initially to be part of Walt Disney's continuing True-Life Adventures series, yet is (arguably) improved upon with the additions of plot, comedic effects, and a beautiful squirrel-dream sequence. The photography is superb, the bemused narration enjoyable, and (as always) Disney underscores the rote stretches with blissful music. Perhaps a bit lengthy for some viewers, but bright children should really enjoy it. Quite entertaining! *** from ****"
126,tt0050837,1,"This is a wonderfully photographed movie. It will be out on DVD on Dec. 5th in the Walt Disney Legacy Collection, True-Life Adventures, Volume 4. It will be restored and remastered so the picture should be like new. Having seen some other True-Life Adventures 30 years ago I am in suspense for this release. Disney Studios produced some of the earliest nature photography and this movie is a wonderful example. This movie is based on a novel by Felix Salten, the author of Bambi. It's the story of a pine squirrel named Perri who lives in the mountains of Utah. She finds a mate, Porro, and together they share many adventures. Many other animals' lives in addition to squirrels are examined in the film, including raccoons, martens, skunks, foxes, beavers and rabbits. Can't wait!"
127,tt0050837,1,"I just saw this on the Turner Classic Movie (TCM) channel, and, as with all other Disney Productions, especially their 'wildlife' movies...this is excellent! It comes from a time when children, people in general, were more pragmatic and realized that the rules of a civilized society don't apply in nature. Yes...there's predation depicted here.The movie is primarily about a baby female pine squirrel, 'Perri,' that goes through life, from a helpless infant to a mature adult. However, the goings-on around her are also examined as well...families and babies of martens; raccoons; skunk; etc. Also featured are a goshawk; wild cat (bobcat); weasel; corn snake; flying squirrels; foxes; and, other wonderful woodland creatures of 1957 wild Utah.The narration is perfect, and, this is a ""must-see"" for anyone who loves the wilderness and the creatures it is home to! :)"
128,tt0050837,1,"Having collecting older 16mm movie films, i have recently come across an old forgotten Disney film called ""Perri"".  having heard of it in my childhood , i was courious and asked to borrow it , to my surprise i was very impressed with it.  this is truly a forgotten treasure of a film,it brings back the old glory days when disney was king. it is similar in part to  walt disney ""bambi"",  but still very impressive. unfortunately to my knowldege this film is not on video, and will thus largely remain unknown or forgotten."
129,tt0050837,1,"Perri, one of Disney's finest examples of ""true life fantasy"" nature movies is best described as a purely cinematic experience.  Few films demonstrate the potential of motion pictures, but Perri does.  Contained within this masterpiece of film is a hibernation/dream sequence that cannot be described in human terms.  I don't know what God is, but I know it when I see it; and Perri is divine revelation ."
181,tt0054390,1,"My 7 year old grandson was held spellbound by Toby Tyler.  I'd love to buy him his own copy, but it's not available.  I'd be thrilled to see Disney release a lot of their archival films. How about a DVD starring Jiminy Cricket?  I can still hear Jiminy singing ""I'm No Fool"".  ""Seabiscuit"" is riding a wave of current popularity, but I still remember Nautilus, Disney's ""The Horse With the Flying Tail"".  A recent commercial on T.V. features rabbits multiplying out of control, but way back when there was a Disney short cartoon about multiplying guinea pigs.  It would be great if future generations of children could savor and enjoy these little cinematic gems."
132,tt0050837,8,"This was gripping. Always wanted to watch a film about a squirrel. Can finally tick that one off! Disney's ""true life fantasy"" was quite effective in its portrayal of the life of Perri and her lover, Porro. After all, who doesn't create their own stories and narratives when watching wildlife documentaries?It has a bit of everything:Squirrel romance and dodgy 'home' renosBeaver chewing down a tree with a squirrel in itRaccoons and skunks brawlingA skunk joining a raccoon family by mistakeThe cosiest squirrel den everA psychedelic dream sequenceA magpie poking a squirrel on the assRaccoons fishing""The face of death""It definitely showcases the cycle of life and was a bit sad in parts. There's certainly a lot of bad things out to get you in life and Perri doesn't shy away from it. It also features a wildfire sequence sure to trigger fellow Australians after we lost 1 billion animals to our bushfire crisis earlier in 2020.Ultimately, I really liked this and found myself smiling and laughing throughout. Go Perri!"
133,tt0050798,1,"While there are many really good dog films out there, in my honest opinion, they all submit to the leader of the pack, and that leader's name is Old Yeller. I first saw this film when I was 10 years old, and have been a huge fan ever since. While the acting is superb, and the story is top notch, the real star of this film is the 170 pound Labrador/Mastiff mix named Spike who played the part of Yeller with heart and soul. If you are one of the few in the world who does not know the story of ""Old Yeller"", be warned that you may shed tears after seeing what many consider to be one of the most heartbreaking scenes in movie history. But that scene only makes you love this movie even more as through tragedy comes hope and learning experiences. Don't miss one of the greatest classics of all time."
134,tt0050798,1,"I must have seen this when I was a kid (on TV), but I'd forgotten just how good a movie this is.  The technical aspects are great (that color!), the acting believable and naturalistic, and the story moves along at a really nice pace.  There's nothing condescending or ""cutesy"" here, and the plot point of the kid trying to play grown up (ie, Tommy Kirk as man of the house while his father's away) is played out without the traps that so many coming-of-age films fall into:  In this boy's world, being an adult is about working and taking responsibility, not sneaking drinks and experimenting with sex.  Also, the ""messages"" were woven nicely into the script, not tacked on and rammed over your head.  It also helped that they had actors, rather than ""stars"".  This is really what family filmmaking (a term I generally hate) should be:  Something that kids and adults can appreciate."
135,tt0050798,8,"Old Yeller is one of Disney's Best.  Superb performances all around, a very touching (especially for dog lovers, it might even be to painful for some i.e. my wife) with a very heart-wrenching ending. They don't make them like this any more. If you enjoyed Old Yeller, may I recommend you give The Yearling a try.  Which is even better (if possible) than Old Yeller."
136,tt0051864,4,"I confess that Conrad Richter's ""The Light in the Forest"" is one my all-time favorite books which I have literally read over a dozen times. So my opinion of Walt Disney's film is heavily influenced by my love of the book.Richter's novel is set in 1764 colonial America when the Ohio tribes were forced to return all their white captives in order to ratify a peace treaty with the British. Among these captives is 15 yr old True Son who was born John Butler and abducted by Delaware Indians from his Pennsylvannia home when he was four. True Son was adopted into the tribe and during the course of his eleven year captivity ceases to believe that he's a captive, forgets his real family, and views himself as an Indian. He also learns to hate all white people. Yet despite these views and his love for his Delaware home and family (which are the only ones he knows), he's forced to return to the family he was born into. He rebels against this with his whole being. He regards his real family as abductors. Even worse, he finds himself related to men who butchered a village of peaceful Christian Indians. True Son dreams of escaping this white prison and returning to his beloved life as a young god in the forest. Eventually, circumstances created by racial hatred cause True Son to find himself rejected by the two worlds that have laid claim to him. It is deeply moving and sad novel of a young man torn apart by the claims of blood and loyalty.So how well did Disney's film capture the message and tone of Richter's novel? It didn't. To put it bluntly, this movie is a complete butchery of Richter's novel. It starts off badly with a cheesy choir singing a song entitled ""The Light in the Forest"" during the opening credits and it gets a whole lot worse. James MacArthur with his stocky frame and curly light brown hair is physically wrong to play the part of the lithe, dark, and black-haired True Son. Also, he did not have the acting ability to capture melancholy sadness and hostility of the character.However, these are quibbles when it comes to the main fault of the movie- sanitizing and/or completely doing away with the entire theme of racial hatred which is the central subject of the novel. True Son knows that he was born white, but he loathes how white people live. He knows that some of his white relations are virulent racists (the character Uncle Wilse is a murdering butcher of Indian women and children) and later is confronted by the fact that the Delawares are not guiltless of committing atrocities. Of course, all this heavy stuff was too much for a 1950's Disney movie so it is not touched upon. However, that leads to the question- why did Disney buy the film rights if they were not going to address the main point of the novel?So if film abandons the central focus of the novel then what is it about? Basically, the movie has a made-up, syrupy teen romance replacing all the dark elements of the novel. Upon his return to his white family,True Son is befriended by a lovely indentured servant girl and a gentle romance starts to bloom (ignoring that in the book True Son finds white girls unattractive in comparison to Indian girls and wants nothing to do with them). True Son escapes to his Indian family, but then decides he liked being with white people after all and returns to his blonde girlfriend. It is a far cry from the novel's ending: a forlorn teenage boy alone in the forest with tears filling his eyes and asking: ""Then who is my father?""Maybe I am being overly harsh on this film. On its own merits, its a well-made piece of Disney escapism. But as a film version of a beloved novel it is an insult."
137,tt0051864,5,"A couple of young players, James MacArthur and Carol Lynley, got their breakout roles in Walt Disney's The Light In The Forest. I saw this way back when I was a 10 year old kid, urged as I always was by the Disney publicity machine greatest in the world then. I doubt any kid who saw both the Disneyland TV show or the Mickey Mouse Club let their parents alone until they saw this or any number of other Disney products.Seeing it almost 60 years later and knowing now what I know of the source of this film, Conrad Richter's novel a whole lot had to be strained out in order to make this G rated entertainment. The Paxton Boys that are headed by Pastor John McIntire were quite real and as murderous a gang of thugs on the frontier as you would find. There is the Conestoga massacre eluded to in the film. That was quite a real incident where many Delawares were slaughtered without reason or provocation, a colonial era Sand Creek. McIntire's character John Elder though had a certain plausible deniability in the affair. Stephen Bekassy's character General Henry Bouquet is also real, he pops up in the Cecil B. DeMille epic Unconquered. The rest is Richter's tale of a young white captive returned to his people by terms of a treaty with Chief Joseph Calleia. MacArthur goes back and accompanying him is scout Fess Parker who kind of eases him into acceptance by his long lost parents Frank Ferguson and Jessica Tandy and others.One who doesn't accept him is Wendell Corey who is a swaggering Indian hating bully. Corey could play some truly hateful people on the big and small screen and he's one of the worst. The climax is the showdown between MacArthur and Corey and I will say viewing it now, what happens makes no sense.Carol Lynley plays a young indentured servant bound to Corey and this is a topic I see rarely discussed. In order to obtain passage from Great Britain one could bind one self over into essential slavery for a period of seven years. Corey who's a cad besides everything else is real interested in Lynley for other than house work. Fess Parker has also a love interest in McIntire's daughter Joanne Dru.Maybe one day we'll get a more true to the book adaption of this story. But The Light In The Forest is a decent Disney film that served its cast well."
138,tt0051864,7,"James MacArthur is very good in early role as young white man in 1760s Philadelphia who, years earlier, was kidnapped and raised by the Delaware Indian tribe, now being traded back to his people as part of a peace agreement. The white man's customs have the kid alienated and sullen, but a sympathetic frontiersman and a lovely servant-girl try to help him adjust. MacArthur has a great masculine stance and a firm jaw--and he's unhurt by his Mohawk haircut--but he's perhaps too rigid; the character might have stood some silly, self-effacing moments. Everything in this adaptation of Conrad Richter's book is taken with the utmost seriousness, but where's the heart of the piece? And with whom should our sympathies lie? Wendell Corey overdoes his role as a town bully--not only racist and a liar, but an alcoholic as well--though Fess Parker's good-hearted scout relieves some of the tension in this solemn scenario. Carol Lynley makes her film debut (playing a white girl named, of all things, Shenandoe!); she's sweet flirting with MacArthur, and looks like Alice in Wonderland in her apron-dresses. Well-produced Walt Disney effort given by-the-books treatment, as if it were written and directed by stodgy history professors, though still engaging for fans of old-fashioned entertainment. *** from ****"
139,tt0051864,8,"WE HAVE READ that Mr. Disney did not have a reputation for his being much of a champion of Civil Rights and for Equality among the members of the Brotherhood of Man. These accusations dated to the early 1960s and even earlier; when the movement was in its infancy. Walt passed on in 1965.ALTHOUGH BY TODAY'S standards and with the benefit of 20-20 hindsight, it would appear that there is some merit to these accusations. But one must take into account that Disney was born 1901, long before the First World War and hence, his attitudes were those of so many others of that period.HOWEVER, HIS THOUGHTFUL and kindly handling of sensitive issues that were very important then as now, was indicative of the true feelings of the man. As case in point, consider his adaption of the Joel Chandler Harris 'Uncle Remus' stories; which was set in the South where it was the labor of Black people in bondage to the plantation owners that drove the agricultural economy.THE RESULTING PICTURE in the form of a mixture of both animation and live action, SONG OF THE SOUTH, is touching, humorous and pays particularly close attention to the emerging culture of the Black American.* AS FOR THE story, it is a well plotted, beautifully photographed drama of the pre-Revolutionary War American Colonies. SET IN OLD Philadelphia, circa 1760, it is done up in a most convincing manner; as to transport the viewer back to the days when even Benjamin Franklin was somewhat youthful. It may have been Disney's best physical production in the Period Piece tradition.THE PLOT REVOLVES around the return of a Caucasian boy, born Johnny Butler, who had been kidnapped by hostile Indians. The boy was raised from the time as a young child as a member of the tribe as, in native aboriginal tongues,""True Son"". The young man, now a teenager, is caught between two peoples' cultures; which was really two worlds.HE IS TORN between the two very different ways of life and finds that he is considered to be alien to both. Eventually, we get the drift that he is going to resettle and be assimilated into the society of colonists; thus returning to his original, biological family. The repatriating of the young man is happily facilitated with his romantic involvement with a beautiful, young blonde colonial girl (played by beautiful, young and blonde Carol Lynley.** THIS PICTURE, PERHAPS more than any other Disney Live Action production, boasts of an outstanding assembly of supporting players. In addition to young Miss Lynley and Mr. MacArthur, we have: Fess Parker, Joanne Dru, Wendell Corey, Jessica Tandy, John McIntire, Joseph Calleia, Frank Ferguson, Marian Seldes, Dean Fredericks and others.*** ALTHOUGH THE STORY'S adaptation is said to have certain liberties with the storyline and certain of the characterizations, it was both very dramatic and effective in its ending. It is a call to action for all to be more understanding and kind to others; regardless of whatever is their membership in any racial, ethnic, national or religious affiliations.AND THIS MESSAGE is the one imparted by Mr. Disney, himself.NOTE * It is never clear in the movie as whether or not that the Black People are slave or free. The topic never really comes up.NOTE: ** On a DIDSNEYLAND TV Episode that was a promo for the movie, it was announced that this was Carol Lynley's first on screen kiss. (It was a far different time!) NOTE: *** Even Iron Eyes Cody, the son of Sicilian immigrants, was featured as an Indian of the Delaware tribe."
140,tt0051864,1,"Disney's great movie. A very beautiful, unforgettable movie. It is a very human and very exciting film.The movie has a very interesting argument,the readjustment of a white boy raised by Indians, who lives many years with the Indians and he is forced to return to white society,after the signing of a peace treaty. I am charmed with James MacArthur.I like James MacArthur.He is beautiful and excellent, great actor.He has soul, a great captivation. My favorite scene is when Johnny (MacArthur) returns to his home and meets again with his biological parents, and also the scenes of love with Shenandoe (Carol Lynley). Others excellent actors who appear in the movie: an magnificent Fess Parker, splendid Frank Ferguson, affectionate Jessica Tandy, lovely Carol Lynley, beautiful Joanne Dru, Wendell Corey, Joseph Calleia,Rafael Campos...It is one of the Disney's best histories.The movie has emotion, romance, nice music and beautiful landscape.Wonderful movie."
141,tt0051864,9,"""The Light in the Forest"" is a live action Disney film that I found on YouTube. I was surprised, as I had never heard about this one before....which is odd since it's a very good movie...one of the better live action films they made during this era.The story is set in the Colonies during the 18th century. A new peace treaty has been created between the British and the local tribes. A provision of that treaty is that all folks kidnapped by these tribes will be repatriated. This story is about Johnny Butler (James MacArthur), a young man who has little recollection of his years spent with white folks. All he really knows is the tribe that raised him...and he was the adopted son of the chief. So, his transition to life among the colonists was problematic, to say the least. The man responsible for returning him to his folks (Fess Parker) isn't planning on leaving the colony until Johnny has adjusted...which might just be a very, very long time.This is a tremendously sensitive film for its time in its portrayal of the natives and because of this, it makes for a fine film...with excellent writing, direction and acting. Well worth seeing and historically fascinating. See this one!"
142,tt0051864,8,"Mainly, the story, based on the novel of the same name, of a boy: True Son(James McArthur), Caucasian by birth, captured by the Delaware 11 years ago, when 4. It takes place in southwestern Pennsylvania and adjacent Ohio in 1764, which is just after the conclusion of the French and Indian War. At this time, most Delaware are located in Ohio, on their gradual westward migration ultimately to Oklahoma. The British want the Delaware to sign a peace treaty granting them exclusive rights to the general area of present Ohio. One of the provisions is that the Delaware must give up all white captives. Unfortunately, this rigid provision makes no allowance for the fact that some of these captives much prefer to remain identified as Delaware. This is especially true of those captured when young in the distant past, and those who have given birth or fathered a child while so captive. True Son was adopted by Chief Cuyloga(Joseph Calleia), cannot remember his natal parents, and has no wish to be returned to white society. Thus, the crux of the story relates to True Son's forced repatriation into white society, where he takes on his birth name: Johnny Butler, and is housed with his birth parents. We experience some of the hardships he encounters toward becoming an accepted member of the white community. He refuses to give up his Mohawk hair style, which constantly reminds others of his Delaware past. He must relearn English ,and learn to chop down and split trees, making fences of some, and various other skills. He must face people like Uncle Wilse(Wendell Corey) who hate all Indians, and perhaps have killed some. Also, he should try to cultivate a friendship with a girl of his age range(He does, with indentured servant(Shenandoe, played by 16y.o. Carol Lynley). ...
At one point, Johnny runs back to become True Son again. But, Chief Cuyloga tells him he must return to the whites. At this point, he doesn't feel comfortable being a Delaware or a white man. What to do? Whom to trust?
See the film to find out. I will say that the film ends on an upbeat note, but how long can it last? The film is especially suitable for teens, but many adults will enjoy it too."
182,tt0054390,7,"But not quite as much as some make out...the circus characters in the book were not that grotesque, not was Toby in an orphan's home, constantly being punished for dishonesty. And, he did become a star, in a sense, on horseback. However, he was a glutonous boy who runs away to the circus, for no reason other than his own selfish ones. He does have a hard life. And his riding on the horses lasts for only about a day, but for that day, he and the girl who rode with them were required to do encores of their performances,Anyways....the story is cute. Yes, Mr. stubbs lives in the movie, but that is typical Disney giving a happy ending, and is to be expected. Watch it for fun, not because you want to compare it to the book. Personally, I like both."
143,tt0051864,5,"While this Disney film attempts to give more sides to the story, it seems to be missing important plot developments and characterization necessities that would have made for a much stronger film. James MacArthur is a white teen raised by native Americans who taught him to hate his own race based upon genuine fears of ""the white devil"". A truce has been declared among the natives and white settlers, but only on the agreement that all whites abducted by the natives be returned to their families. MacArthur, the natural son of John McIntire and Jessica Tandy, has learned the ways of the Indian brave too deeply and at first rejects the white man's ways.But through the patience of kind mother Tandy (initially at odds with supporting his native American ways), MacArthur slowly begins to adapt, especially when he befriends the pretty Carol Lynley whose own family was allegedly slaughtered by another native tribe. However, Lynley's cruel, native hating foster father (Wendell Corey) makes life difficult for MacArthur, and he escapes to be reunited with his tribe and best friend Rafael Campos who came to bring him home.One of the issues I have with this film is it's true lack of a point of view. Is it pro-native, or trying to show how the natives needed to switch to the European ways to survive in the old world that had been taken over by newcomers? Performances are fine (especially Corey as a truly despicable character), and the photography is pretty, but there's just a little too much Disney ""cutesiness"" to truly deal with the harsh topics. what other reviewers have said, perhaps one day there will be a realistic story told about similar topics that makes its viewpoint clear, but this is not it."
144,tt0051864,7,"I had a fun enough time with 'The Light in the Forest'.It isn't one that had me on the edge of my seat or anything like that, but it's a decent story about a young boy choosing his destiny; albeit in the midst of the questionable White/Native American theme. The low run time and enjoyable cast more than likely help nudge my feelings upward.James MacArthur (Johnny) and Fess Parker (Del) are both good, admittedly you could describe their acting as wooden in patches though I actually think they work for this film and together. I liked Johnny's friendship with Rafael Campos' Half Arrow, also.There's not much more to note really, it's simply a solid production."
145,tt0052300,8,"Originally, this was to have been called ""Comanche,"" the title of the novel it is based on. Just before the Disney company was about to release their latest western, though, a B oater starring Dana Andrews with that name hit theatres. That one dealt with Comanche Indians. This one, with Comanche, a horse owned by a member of the seventh cavalry that survived the Little Big Horn and led to the tradition of the riderless horse still in existence today. Disney changed the name to Tonka, which is what a young Sioux boy, White Bull (Sal Mineo) calls the horse after catching it - short for Tonka Wakon, or the Great One. The change of titles actually works to the film's benefit, for Disney and company placed more emphasis on the Indian side of the story than the cavalry's, making this the first movie ever made to tell the story of Custer's Last Stand from the Indian point of view, at least up to Little Big Man (1970) - and in truth that was from the point of view of a what man raised by the Indians. Mineo, who would again play an Indian youth in a much bigger film, John Ford's Cheyenne Autumn (1964), is believable, and the film is sympathetic to Native Americans, without being patronizing or condescending, in a way that we expect today, but which no Hollywood filmmaker but Disney did back in the fifties - he was P.C. before P.C. existed, and may just have created the climate of tolerance that we strive for today. Philip Carey plays the sympathetic cavalryman Miles Keogh, and it's worth noting that this was the first Disney western NOT to star Fess Parker, who had been their headliner since Davy Crockett four years earlier. Very accurate staging of the Little Big Horn battle, as this is one of the only films ever made to reveal that Custer (Britt Lomond, the villainous Monastario on Disney's ZORRO TV show) had his hair trimmed short just before the battle, and that he did not carry a sword to the battle - and neither did any of his men. Those who expect Disney films to be sanitized ought to catch this one, as the Last Stand is quite bloody considering the time period in which it was made, forcing child viewers to deal with the unromantic truth of warfare on the plains, circa 1876. A little gem worth rediscovering."
146,tt0053285,1,"When I was a little girl, Sleeping Beauty was my all time favorite Disney film. I was so in love with this story, it's crazy how many times I wore out the VHS. But growing up, I lost touch with the story, but I recently bought the DVD and re-watched the film and you know what? I'm still in love with this movie. I really miss these old Disney movies where the animation was so bright and beautiful, the characters were so lovable, and the story was so magical. I'm not bashing Disney films from today, just I'm sure we could all relate on this subject where the older Disney films just had a certain charm about it. Sleeping Beauty is just a timeless story and has so much wonderful romance, I guess since I'm a girl, I just couldn't help but still be in love with this beautiful story.Princess Aurora is born and is the future queen of her land, three fairy's, Flora, Merryweather, and Fauna bless her with three gifts: beauty and song, right as Merryweather is about to bless Aurora, the evil witch, Maleficent, comes in and curses Aurora that she shall touch a spinning wheel by her 16th birthday and die! Merryweather changes it to where she won't die, but sleep and could only be woke up by the kiss of true love. The fairy's wish to keep this from happening still, so they take Aurora and raise her as their own. One day Aurora on her 16th birthday goes out in the forest and meets the charming and handsome Prince Phillipe, but she doesn't know he's a prince and she doesn't know he's fhe man she's actually betrothed too. She is told by the fairy's that she can never see him again and that she's a princess; later that night the curse happens! Now the fairy's need Phillipe to save Aurora before it's too late.Everything about Sleeping Beauty is just a perfect Disney film and I can't wait until to show this to my future kids one day. I know that their generation is going to have just the CGI animation, so it's good that at least we still have these films, they're treasures. The voices, the animation, the story, Sleeping Beauty is the most romantic fairy tale that anyone could easily fall in love with. If you are a Disney fan, this is a must see, it's a great family film or if you're just a film buff in general, I'm a grown up and I still tear up when I watch Sleeping Beauty.10/10"
147,tt0053285,9,"""Sleeping Beauty"" was envisioned by the great Walt Disney as his masterpiece--the feature-length cartoon par excellence. And, in many ways, it is. The then-record budget (six million dollars) was the largest ever for an animated motion picture. The widescreen Technirama 70 process had never been used for an animated feature. The six-track magnetic stereo sound was a step upward from the ""Fantasound"" system employed in ""Fantasia"" (1940). Also new and trend-setting was the style of the animation--a more realistic, geometric design which, surprisingly left many critics and audiences cold. The extra expense needed to showcase the widescreen film properly, together with the lukewarm reviews, prevented ""Sleeping Beauty"" from turning a profit at the box office when it was released (with much fanfare) in 1959. But time has been kind to the film, subsequent reissues have finally put it in the profit margin, and both viewers and critics are appreciating it for the beautiful fantasy it has always been. However, like it's predecessor ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" (1937) which was Disney's first fairy tale, as well as his first full-length film, this screen adaptation of ""Sleeping Beauty"" strays from it's origins. While the Charles Perrault version of the tale is given as the source, there are new variations. The original story is as follows: When a baby girl is born to a King and Queen, they invite seven (or, in the Grimm version, twelve) Fairies to the christening. Uninvited is an evil fairy, who shows up anyway, and curses the child with death on her 16th birthday. Although a good fairy is able to alter the spell, the princess is doomed to sleep (along with the court) for 100 years. Despite the precautions taken, the curse is fulfilled (accidentally, in most versions of the story) and the princess does indeed sleep for a century, after which a prince awakens her. Understandably, Disney's telling departs from Perrault here as well, because in Perrault's version, the King and Queen are the sole members of the court who do not succumb to the sleeping spell, and, eventually die of old age. The Disney version of the tale whittles the number of good fairies down to three, giving them the appearance and personalities of elderly women. Meanwhile, the evil fairy, dubbed Maleficent, is a cold, flamboyant villainess who, for better or worse, overshadows everyone else in the film (but then, the villain always does). Disney's retelling also dispenses with the Heroine's 100 year sleep which lasts merely one night. There is much emphasis put on the three fairies who secretly, in the guise of peasants, raise the baby princess Aurora, (whom they dub ""Briar Rose"" interestingly, the name given the Princess in the Grimm retelling) and, unwittingly make it possible for Maleficent to execute her curse. Also new, is the introduction at the beginning of the film of Prince Phillip, who is immediately betrothed to Aurora. The climatic battle he has with the evil fairy, here transformed into a dragon, has become one of the most memorable parts of the film, though it was purely the scriptwriter's invention. In the end, however, it is best to appreciate the film as a stand-alone creation, rather than a faithful adaptation of a classic story. Indeed, as some latter-day critics have pointed out, ""Sleeping Beauty"" has been embraced by the young and old audiences who find in it many of the same sword and sorcery elements in films like ""Legend"" and ""Excalibur"". And every penny of it's then-unprecedented budget is on the screen. One marvels at the intricate design of the animation, all accomplished well before the advent of computers, which the Technirama screen showcases to full effect. The voice talent is perfect. Mary Costa, who went on to an estimable opera career, is a lovely and expressive Aurora, while Bill Shirley is an ingratiating Prince Phillip. Eleanor Audley (so deliciously cold as the stepmother in Disney's ""Cinderella"") is the embodiment of majestic evil as Maleficent. Verna Felton (the Fairy Godmother in Disney's ""Cinderella""), Barbara Jo Allen and Barbara Luddy are the delightful (and all too human) fairies, Flora, Fauna and Merryweather. Aurora's father, King Stefan, is voiced by Taylor Holmes, with Bill Thompson as Phillip's father King Hubert. A word should also be said for Candy Candido, who provided the sounds made by Maleficent's goons. The Tchaykovsky ballet score provides both the background music and melodies used for the new songs. All this blends perfectly in an epic adventure/fantasy seldom experienced on screen, and one with enough heart to capture the most cynical viewer. The Special Edition DVD, released in 2003, and currently out of print, is another example of what a ""Special Edition"" truly encompasses, including a fully restored widescreen print of the film, a new 5.1 stereo mix which fully showcases the Academy Award nominated score, as well as many bonus features with appeal to all ages (including a widescreen/fullscreen comparison which should be the last word on that subject). Also included are several complimentary historical shorts like the Academy Award winning ""Grand Canyon"" which accompanied ""Sleeping Beauty"" on it's initial release. Trailers, games, interviews with Mary Costa and surviving animators, vintage featurettes which delve into the making of the film, and last, but not least, footage of Disney himself, complete the dazzling package. Finally awakened from her long slumber, and more refreshingly lovely than ever, ""Sleeping Beauty"" is a film (and DVD) for the ages."
148,tt0053285,8,"...which is that it may have been designed more for an adult audience than a children's. At any rate it was way ahead of its time in 1959. ""Sleeping Beauty"" was one of the movies I watched as a child, and its grandness overwhelmed me even at the age of ten. I couldn't be happier to see it finally in the DVD format. But watch closely; you'll notice many subtle, sophisticated things which other viewers have touched on in earlier reviews. The animation is almost surreal-- so incredibly lifelike that it abandons its cute, 'Disneyesque' pretensions from previous fairy tales. There are no talking mice, dogs or cats anywhere to be seen. Here the animals are silent, as animals are supposed to be. (I love the sequence with the forest animals as they are awakened by the singing of the barefoot princess and join up with her, like multiple chaperons, in harmonious whistles.) Even the fairy godmothers- who may initially appear as sugary stereotypes- spend so much time bickering (well, two of them do anyway) that you get to identify them as thoroughly fleshed out personalities. The adaptation of the original Perrault fairy tale is also impressive. An ingenious move was to have the prince and princess meet in the forest *first* and fall in love- unaware that they are already engaged to be married. Someone mentioned the chilling sequence which shows the princess, cloaked in an eerie green pallor, actually being lured to the fateful spinning wheel. So dark, so frightening- when was the last time you saw something like this in a Disney fairy tale? And then immediately afterwords is a cleansing sequence of unmatched beauty showing the fairies sailing through the sky like fireflies, magically dusting the rest of the castle to sleep. It is, of course, only matched by the film's finale which shows storm clouds, lightning, a forest of thorns, and a flame-spewing dragon-- all seamlessly bringing the story to a 75-minute conclusion. It stands, in my opinion, as Disney's masterpiece."
149,tt0053285,1,"I grew up in the Disney era where ""Little Mermaid,"" ""Beauty and the Beast,"" ""Aladdin"" and ""The Lion King"" reigned supreme among me and my elementary school pals (and to this day, if you ask one of my peers what their favorite Disney movie is, it's probably one of those or one of the Disney-Pixar creations).  But one Disney film has always remained my utter favorite and that is, indeed, ""Sleeping Beauty.""Like most children, I grew up watching Disney movies -- everything from animated films like ""Snow White"" to ""Lady and the Tramp,"" the semi-animated like ""Mary Poppins"" and ""Bedknobs and Broomsticks,"" and the non-animated such as ""The Parent Trap"" and ""Old Yeller.""  But ""Sleeping Beauty"" remains my favorite animated movie and you'd better believe at seventeen years of age, I'm still watching it.  I cannot believe how the animation has been knocked in some reviews -- it's beautiful!  They captured the medieval period so well and even the people look like, well, people.  The score is beautiful and the songs ""I Wonder"" and ""Once Upon a Dream"" are sung wonderfully by Mary Costa.  What a voice!  Aurora is by far one of the prettiest Disney princesses (one thing that initially drew me to the movie as a child), following the formula with those trademark doe-eyes that Disney bestows upon all of their princesses and heroines.  Prince Phillip actually does more than just show up to sing a song and say one line, a welcome change that answers the age old question, ""What does she see in him anyway?"" The three fairies are delightful (I always wanted to be Fauna!) and funny. And of course, there's the quintessential villain -- Maleficent.  She scared me when I was younger and when I view the film now, no wonder.  (For the longest time, I was also scared of Eleanor Audley period, but she's truly a marvelous actress.)  And when Phillip kills her -- yeah, you'd better believe that's some scary business.  The story is beautiful and funny, the animation is divine, the music ethereal, and the voice talents extraordinary.  This is a personal favorite and it comes highly recommended!"
150,tt0393735,7,"I took my 12 year old grandson to see it and he was rolling on the floor for most of the film. I was surprised that it was actually funny,much more surprise than I was prepared for. This is a funny movie for those preteens and early teens as they seem to really enjoy it. Sure it is not full of high tech special effects and should never be compared to the Matrix, but it is a Disney! movie --- get it... a Disney movie. Take that into consideration ... how many Disney movies achieve high ratings anyway, other than the classics? This is a fun movie. I saw the original and it was funny too. Remember way back when everything was black and white and not color? The special effects in this movie are not very high tech and some of the metamorphosis takes place when you do not see it, so do not expect ""the wolf-man"" changes to be shown, nope, one shot he is a man, the next he is a dog. Some of the other critters are pretty funny too and kids seem to love this movie."
151,tt0393735,8,"So it's a dumb movie with a dumb plot - what do you expect? Agatha Christie? Robert Ludlum? This is a Disney film for children!As a kids' movie, it's a lot of fun with plenty of slapstick and lots of laughs. The plot is goofy, but the basic premise is hardly meant to be realistic. This is not cinema verité. People give ""What Women Want"" with Mel Gibson a much higher rating, but that's just as daft.There are plenty of set-piece chases, as you would expect with a storyline about dogs. If you want clever, go see the Usual Suspects, just don't take your under-eights."
152,tt0393735,7,"Went today to see this film. another remake but admittedly haven't seen the original. And I personally thought it was OK. Had three kids with me...14 yr old 8 yr old and 6yr old who all sat watching it, enjoying it and laughing away. Me too. Tim Allen was great as usual and def suits the comedy side of acting. Bit samey with the oldest child a teenage daughter who wears different clothes and wants to be rebellious...father works a lot and isn't the most committed father..mother who seems to do it all and has had enough and then the younger son who just seems to want to do his own thing but hasn't the nerve to say it. BUT apart from that the dog was great, Tim Allen and Robery Downey Jnr were great(nice to see Downey in something), some funny scenes with the actors and with the animals. Bit slow to start with but gets better. Def entertaining for kids and adults..if only Disney done more like this, seem to have dome some fantastic films years ago and then lost the plot a bit. Worth seeing"
153,tt0393735,5,"It's a funny movie. Don't ""compare"" it to the older one, it just isn't the same, it's made for the youth of today. Not sure what some expected, but those rating this a ""1"" obviously don't get out to see many movies, or are looking for something that just isn't this movie. It's funny, not Awful as a rating of 1 would suggest. Now, as far as Disney or the like goes, it's an average movie, below that which Tim Allen is capable of, this is more what I might expect to see on Sunday night TV, not on a big screen. Unfortunately as the Disney Corporation becomes more and more ""corporate"" and moves further from it's founding principles, its products are slowly failing to impress and differentiate themselves from the hordes of the plain and ordinary and unimaginative.Wow, blah blah, just an average new age Disney movie, not awful but certainly not anything to write home about."
154,tt0393735,7,"I took my daughter to see this movie, and we both enjoyed it very much. We can't wait until it comes out on DVD to add to our personal collection. I really was happy with the fact that there wasn't any profanity throughout the entire movie. It reminded me of the good old days when rated PG movies could be watched by the entire family. We laughed throughout the entire movie, and it managed to hold my 8 year old daughter's attention, which is commendable within itself. So, I really wanted to say Thank You to all of the individuals who were apart of the decision making process of making sure that this movie was completely decent for our children to watch."
155,tt0393735,1,"Assistant D.A. David Douglas (Allen) finds himself barking up the wrong tree, after he's bitten by a dog being experimented on in a laboratory and suddenly finds himself acting and the turning into a dog himself.Tim Allen's film career is a case of hit or miss. The Santa Clause movies are offset by Joe Somebody and Christmas with the Kranks. Unfortunately, The Shaggy Dog is in the latter group. To be blunt, the film is pretty bad. The movie was not funny and it was quite dull. I know it's just a harmless family film but did it have to be so boring and humorless? Of course it didn't. I always thought family movies were supposed to entertain the entire family not just one age group of the family. The Shaggy Dog may prove to be an enjoyable treat for the kids but most people over the age of 13 will probably hate it.The acting is only okay and the decent cast keeps the film from completely sinking. Tim Allen gives a decent performance as Dave but he really needs to stop doing lame family movies. Kristin Davis also gives a decent performance and she is also way above this material. I really don't like Spencer Breslin. He just annoys me and his acting isn't very good. The Shaggy Dog did not change my opinion about him. Zena Grey just gives a bland performance, nothing special from her. Robert Downey Jr. gives a decent performance as the bad guy. Danny Glover is wasted in his role and he barely appears on screen.The first twenty minutes or so are actually pretty enjoyable. After that, the movie starts reusing the same jokes and it becomes more serious. There was probably a break from the laughter for about 30 minutes since the movie was handling serious issues in a lighthearted way. I think the director did this to attract both adults and children but he ended up alienating both of them. The stupid humor will probably bore adults and the serious scenes will probably bore the children. I have never seen the original Shaggy Dog movies and maybe that's how those films were handled as well. However, the film seemed a little misdirected to me which isn't surprising since there are five(!) credited screenwriters. Behind the camera, it seems like things were a little messy and it shows in the movie. In the end, The Shaggy Dog is a harmless yet humorless family film that should appeal to the kids. Everyone else should skip the movie. Rating 3/10"
156,tt0393735,9,"Tim Allen may be the most underrated and generous comic actor working today, willing to pursue any honest laugh to please his audience. But he's clever about it, and the slapstick in this remake rivals the pioneering skill of silent film comedians. This is Allen's best work since ""Galaxy Quest.""The ultimate test of this movie is the child you take along (including the one we carry in our heart). My daughter laughed and had a great time. She even explained the DNA cloning technology in such a way that demonstrated just how much craft when into the screenplay -- ""make it understandable to a kid under 12"" -- even though the pseudo science of the plot often distracted my adult mind.I never saw the original flick with Fred MacMurray. But I did see Lon Chaney play The Wolfman, and a dozen other werewolf movies. This is a G-rated version of the same mythology, and it resonates for me as an adult, but flies over the head of my youngster. ""The Shaggy Dog"" works on two distinct levels while satisfying both audiences -- I only wish all family movies were this good."
157,tt0393735,1,"OK, you know what let's get to the chase: ITS AWFUL!!!!!! The Shaggy Dog was obviously targeted for kids, and you know what? I'm not sure if they liked it! This is a pitiful movie and I can't believe some people paid money to see this! (Don't worry, I got free tickets.) This is movie I would never, ever recommend, and PLEASE take this advice and use it! I mean, don't get me wrong, Kristin Davis and Tim Allen are good actors, but this wasn't for them. heck, I don't think Reese Witherspoon could have saved this trailer trash!I know Disney is trying to become a more broad studio, but this movies is in with Gigli and In the Mix, and for some advice for Disney, this isn't a place you want to be.

There are several funny scenes like the bathroom and park scenes that are just hilarious. I think they wasted their money on the CG effects on the cat chasing scene.

(Note: The dog is actually a bearded collie.) (Walt Disney, Run time 1:38, Rated PG) (5/10)"
160,tt0393735,7,"I took my 12 year old grandson to see it and he was rolling on the floor for most of the film. I was surprised that it was actually funny,much more surprise than I was prepared for. This is a funny movie for those preteens and early teens as they seem to really enjoy it. Sure it is not full of high tech special effects and should never be compared to the Matrix, but it is a Disney! movie --- get it... a Disney movie. Take that into consideration ... how many Disney movies achieve high ratings anyway, other than the classics? This is a fun movie. I saw the original and it was funny too. Remember way back when everything was black and white and not color? The special effects in this movie are not very high tech and some of the metamorphosis takes place when you do not see it, so do not expect ""the wolf-man"" changes to be shown, nope, one shot he is a man, the next he is a dog. Some of the other critters are pretty funny too and kids seem to love this movie."
161,tt0393735,8,"So it's a dumb movie with a dumb plot - what do you expect? Agatha Christie? Robert Ludlum? This is a Disney film for children!As a kids' movie, it's a lot of fun with plenty of slapstick and lots of laughs. The plot is goofy, but the basic premise is hardly meant to be realistic. This is not cinema verité. People give ""What Women Want"" with Mel Gibson a much higher rating, but that's just as daft.There are plenty of set-piece chases, as you would expect with a storyline about dogs. If you want clever, go see the Usual Suspects, just don't take your under-eights."
162,tt0393735,7,"Went today to see this film. another remake but admittedly haven't seen the original. And I personally thought it was OK. Had three kids with me...14 yr old 8 yr old and 6yr old who all sat watching it, enjoying it and laughing away. Me too. Tim Allen was great as usual and def suits the comedy side of acting. Bit samey with the oldest child a teenage daughter who wears different clothes and wants to be rebellious...father works a lot and isn't the most committed father..mother who seems to do it all and has had enough and then the younger son who just seems to want to do his own thing but hasn't the nerve to say it. BUT apart from that the dog was great, Tim Allen and Robery Downey Jnr were great(nice to see Downey in something), some funny scenes with the actors and with the animals. Bit slow to start with but gets better. Def entertaining for kids and adults..if only Disney done more like this, seem to have dome some fantastic films years ago and then lost the plot a bit. Worth seeing"
163,tt0393735,5,"It's a funny movie. Don't ""compare"" it to the older one, it just isn't the same, it's made for the youth of today. Not sure what some expected, but those rating this a ""1"" obviously don't get out to see many movies, or are looking for something that just isn't this movie. It's funny, not Awful as a rating of 1 would suggest. Now, as far as Disney or the like goes, it's an average movie, below that which Tim Allen is capable of, this is more what I might expect to see on Sunday night TV, not on a big screen. Unfortunately as the Disney Corporation becomes more and more ""corporate"" and moves further from it's founding principles, its products are slowly failing to impress and differentiate themselves from the hordes of the plain and ordinary and unimaginative.Wow, blah blah, just an average new age Disney movie, not awful but certainly not anything to write home about."
164,tt0393735,7,"I took my daughter to see this movie, and we both enjoyed it very much. We can't wait until it comes out on DVD to add to our personal collection. I really was happy with the fact that there wasn't any profanity throughout the entire movie. It reminded me of the good old days when rated PG movies could be watched by the entire family. We laughed throughout the entire movie, and it managed to hold my 8 year old daughter's attention, which is commendable within itself. So, I really wanted to say Thank You to all of the individuals who were apart of the decision making process of making sure that this movie was completely decent for our children to watch."
165,tt0393735,1,"Assistant D.A. David Douglas (Allen) finds himself barking up the wrong tree, after he's bitten by a dog being experimented on in a laboratory and suddenly finds himself acting and the turning into a dog himself.Tim Allen's film career is a case of hit or miss. The Santa Clause movies are offset by Joe Somebody and Christmas with the Kranks. Unfortunately, The Shaggy Dog is in the latter group. To be blunt, the film is pretty bad. The movie was not funny and it was quite dull. I know it's just a harmless family film but did it have to be so boring and humorless? Of course it didn't. I always thought family movies were supposed to entertain the entire family not just one age group of the family. The Shaggy Dog may prove to be an enjoyable treat for the kids but most people over the age of 13 will probably hate it.The acting is only okay and the decent cast keeps the film from completely sinking. Tim Allen gives a decent performance as Dave but he really needs to stop doing lame family movies. Kristin Davis also gives a decent performance and she is also way above this material. I really don't like Spencer Breslin. He just annoys me and his acting isn't very good. The Shaggy Dog did not change my opinion about him. Zena Grey just gives a bland performance, nothing special from her. Robert Downey Jr. gives a decent performance as the bad guy. Danny Glover is wasted in his role and he barely appears on screen.The first twenty minutes or so are actually pretty enjoyable. After that, the movie starts reusing the same jokes and it becomes more serious. There was probably a break from the laughter for about 30 minutes since the movie was handling serious issues in a lighthearted way. I think the director did this to attract both adults and children but he ended up alienating both of them. The stupid humor will probably bore adults and the serious scenes will probably bore the children. I have never seen the original Shaggy Dog movies and maybe that's how those films were handled as well. However, the film seemed a little misdirected to me which isn't surprising since there are five(!) credited screenwriters. Behind the camera, it seems like things were a little messy and it shows in the movie. In the end, The Shaggy Dog is a harmless yet humorless family film that should appeal to the kids. Everyone else should skip the movie. Rating 3/10"
166,tt0393735,9,"Tim Allen may be the most underrated and generous comic actor working today, willing to pursue any honest laugh to please his audience. But he's clever about it, and the slapstick in this remake rivals the pioneering skill of silent film comedians. This is Allen's best work since ""Galaxy Quest.""The ultimate test of this movie is the child you take along (including the one we carry in our heart). My daughter laughed and had a great time. She even explained the DNA cloning technology in such a way that demonstrated just how much craft when into the screenplay -- ""make it understandable to a kid under 12"" -- even though the pseudo science of the plot often distracted my adult mind.I never saw the original flick with Fred MacMurray. But I did see Lon Chaney play The Wolfman, and a dozen other werewolf movies. This is a G-rated version of the same mythology, and it resonates for me as an adult, but flies over the head of my youngster. ""The Shaggy Dog"" works on two distinct levels while satisfying both audiences -- I only wish all family movies were this good."

This is a pitiful movie and I can't believe some people paid money to see this! (Don't worry, I got free tickets.) This is movie I would never, ever recommend, and PLEASE take this advice and use it! I mean, don't get me wrong, Kristin Davis and Tim Allen are good actors, but this wasn't for them. heck, I don't think Reese Witherspoon could have saved this trailer trash!I know Disney is trying to become a more broad studio, but this movies is in with Gigli and In the Mix, and for some advice for Disney, this isn't a place you want to be.

170,tt0052722,9,"I saw this movie on TV as a child, and the scenes of the banshee and the death coach scared and impressed me so much, I carried the memory of them all my life.  When I was an adult and saw it on video, I was astonished to find that the scenes are STILL impressive and creepy!  Considering how sophisticated special effects have become since 'Darby O'Gill' was made in 1959, that's quite a tribute to the moviemaking skills of the day.  The scenery is lovely, the actors skilful and wholeheartedly into their work, the music catchy and delightful, and really there's nothing not to like in this movie.  The duels between Darby and his nemesis, King Brian, are wonderfully funny, as each tries to outsmart the other.  The village characters are all well-drawn and likeable personalities.  Pony Sugrue seems more 'American' than the others, but then, he's not supposed really to fit in in the village, and his punishment at the end is an enjoyable comeuppance.  Favourite scenes - the banshee and death coach at the end, as mentioned, and all the leprechauns dancing under the fairy mountain then riding their little white horses out into the night as Darby plays them a wild tune on his fiddle.  Don't be put off by the date on this movie; it's as good now as the day it was made."
171,tt0053352,1,"One of the well hidden Disney classics is Ken Annikens Third Man on the Mountains released in 1959. It stars Michael Rennie as Captain Winters who comes to a Swiss village to climb the Citadel, one of the worlds highest and most dangerous mountains and the peak that claimed the life of Rudy Matt's father, played by James McCarther.  It was filmed on location in Zermatt Switzerland where the 14,000 foot Matterhorn stands. It is one of the great adventure films of all time taken from the book Banner in the Sky by James Ramsey Ullman. Very few movies have been made about mountain climbing, The Mountain with Spencer Tracy, The White Tower with Glenn Ford and The Eiger Sanction with Clint Eastwood. But Third Man on the Mountain has the most heart. All of the above films are on video tape."
172,tt0053352,1,"I saw this film on the old Disney show back decades ago, and liked it very much, then sort of forgot about it. These days the Disney channel shows it periodically, and whenever it's on and I'm watching television, I can't help but stayed tuned to this one. For anyone who's ever climbed a mountain this movie is a treat. The story is beyond simple: a young man in 19th century Switzerland whose father was killed trying to climb the Citadel (which is what the Matterhorn is called here) wants to become a mountaineer himself, and of course climb to the top of the Citadel, which no man has done. His mother strictly forbids it, and his uncle downright nasty to him whenever the subject comes up. Persistent fellow that he is, the boy hooks up with an English mountain climber, then coaxes his uncle to take him along on a climb, makes an ass of himself, then has a go at it again. The boy doesn't really have the maturity for the task, but persists, and in time he grows up, almost in spite of himself.There's a larger than life quality to this movie, which was filmed on location. Director Ken Annakin, who never achieved his potential, shows himself a first-rate movie man here. The Swiss village and the looming mountains beyond convey an odd mood, as the place feels alternately dangerous, as if on the edge of the world, and beautiful, because of what one sees out the window every day. There's an intimacy between the clannish villagers, with their peculiar garb and gingerbread homes, that's caught to absolute perfection by Annakin and his crew. Everything seems real in this film; stylized as it sometimes is, it has an unmistakable ring of (admittedly Disneyfied) truth.As to the climbing scenes, they are wonderfully photographed, with the camera seemingly in the right place at all times. One gets just close enough to experience at least some of the danger and excitement of mountain-climbing, with the camera pulling back periodically to show a larger view, invariably breathtaking. The actors are all competent. James MacArthur's non-charisma actually helps movie the picture along, as one is often more aware of who he's with than his character. He fades into the background somewhat, as young men often do, with the older, more experienced adults dominating. James Donald is brilliant as his uncle, creating a fully rounded portrait of a man who looks after  his nephew, who for reasons never wholly explained, likes to belittle him. Michael Rennie is sturdy as the Englishman and Janet Munro makes a perky love interest. Herbert Lom almost steals the show as Saxo, the outsider from beyond, who also wants to climb the Citadel, and has a disagreeable disposition. He dresses differently from the others, and even wears a different sort of hat. Lom comes across as foreign, as we can see why people don't take to him in this little close-knit society. There are few surprises in this film, but it tells its familiar and largely predictable story with great flair and feeling for the people it's about, showing once more that one can make an outstanding, maybe even great film, out of seemingly routine, even threadbare material, if one hunkers down really hard and gives it one's best shot, as clearly everyone connected with this movie did."
180,tt0054390,1,"You can't find this one to buy anywhere. I finally found it at Moviehunter.com. It was a thrill to see the most important film of an eleven-year-old's life. I saw this film when I was eleven and never forgot it. I sat in the movie theater all day and saw it three consecutive times. You could do that back then. I would have seen it a fourth time, but I had to go home for dinner. This is a sweet, warm, loving, exciting adventure film about a boy joining the circus and making new friends, including a mischievous chimp and a dishonest boss. It's the old Disney style all the way. It's great for kids, and there's nothing negative to say about it. Too bad Disney doesn't realize it and re-release it and make it available on DVD and VHS. Barbara Beaird is a blonde 12-year-old in this film, and she was the first puppy-love of my young life. I always wonder what ever happened to her. Kevin ""Moochie"" Corcoran steals the show, or maybe I should say the chimp does."
173,tt0053352,1,"Third Man on the Mountain ranks among the very best live-action films ever produced by Walt Disney. Period mountain-climbing film works as both a white-knuckle adventure thriller and compelling coming-of-age story. Highlights include sensational location photography and stunt work, strong character performances, terrific period detail, and a fine screenplay by Eleanore Griffin. Film takes its time establishing its characters, before building towards unusually gripping second half, where the human drama becomes as suspenseful as the high-altitude acrobatics.Current DVD uses badly-worn elements for its source, with swarms of dirt, scratches, and ugly grain. It might, in fact, be the exact same transfer used in the 90's for the laserdisc release. Modern DVD resolution and large-screen televisions make the result unacceptable, especially for a film of this caliber. Disney Home Video needs to revisit this title and give it the respect it deserves.Trivia: The Matterhorn ride at California's Disneyland theme park is based on the killer mountain seen in this film."
174,tt0053352,1,"I was eight years old in 1970, when our primary school in Northern Ireland assembled all the students into the gymnasium to see ""a film"". The film was Third man on the Mountain. A quiet loner who detested the boredom of sports that chased an object around an enclosed playing field, I was captivated by this film, and knew that I wanted to climb. I am 43 years old now, and have spent my life climbing and enjoying the beauty of the mountains. I have just purchased this film on DVD but will wait until Christmas Eve, to see it for the first time in 35 years.In an age where Hollywood gratifies violence, profanity, and promiscuity, caring parents would do well to, not only let their children see this great adventure story; but to sit with them and watch it as a family. As a teenager, I never once attended a 'house-party', drank, or engaged in the trash that often creates arrogant, ungrateful, and belligerent adolescents. The memory of this film never left my mind, and kept me focused in life. Honour, self discipline, respect for our elders and caring about what others think of us; as well as a great story of personal determination and effort, young people today need to be presented with the values that used to be 'normal' in society.The real locations used in the filming provide a welcome relief from the slick, computer-animations and green-screen fakery of modern celluloid, and the climbing depictions are far, far superior to anything that has since been passed off by Hollywood, as 'mountaineering'. Having to EARN respect, working and striving for goals, personal sacrifice, and a good story: parents owe this film to their children."
175,tt0053352,8,"This visually stunning film about the true story in the mid-19th century of a young man's need to conquer a mountain in the Swiss Alps that claimed the life of his father 16 years before is an exciting, gripping story that the entire family can enjoy. Young Rudi Matt (James MacArthur) is helped in his quest by famed British climber Captain John Winter, played by Michael Rennie, and their easy, warm chemistry also helps to make this a delightful film for all ages. If you are a fan of Michael Rennie, this film is a must-have for your collection, as his role is large and he gives a wonderful performance. If you are a fan of family adventure films, I recommend this film to you as one that your children will undoubtedly find entrancing, as will you. ""Third Man on the Mountain"" is a heartwarming, emotionally satisfying journey of a youth into a young man as well as an exciting story of mountain climbing in the 1800's."
176,tt0053352,9,"Young man in 1860s Switzerland, working as a lowly dishwasher, longs to climbs The Citadel--the same treacherous mountain his beloved father died trying to scale. Live-action Disney film has colorful production, strong performances and a sincere script about following your dreams and overcoming the odds. Sturdy lad James MacArthur is well-cast in the leading role, and his shy manner and yet driven spirit is engaging; Janet Munro once again plays the proverbial Disney love-interest, but she's appealing here too, a feisty, devoted female. Based on James Ramsey Ullman's book ""Banner In The Sky"", and the inspiration for Disneyland's Matterhorn ride, this is a well-plotted family film that thoughtful kids should really enjoy. ***1/2 from ****"
177,tt0053352,8,"Wonderful stuff! I saw this at a school screening in 1970, noticed over the years afterwards it was seldom shown on UK TV, however never forgot it even though I was never interested in becoming a mountaineer or a sherpa when old enough. It's a simple wholesome family Disney live action adventure, today's cynical polluted generations could probably spend days poring over its stereotypes and corn and missing the point: to enjoy a harmless 107 minutes with a feelgood movie.Young lad Rudi (James MacArthur) dreams of climbing the Matterhorn but is forced to be a hotel dishwasher instead, therefore something's got to give: you can't bottle the wind after all. He gets his chance when kindly top mountaineer Michael Rennie takes him under his wing much to his cautious uncle James Donald's disgust and later greasy guide Herbert Lom's disdain. Some splendid shots of bodies climbing impossible rocks, lovely sunny Swiss scenery and much angst between the characters leads to an admittedly rather flat conclusion, but all was well anyway. Rudi's doe eyed ever smiling girlfriend Lisbeth (Janet Munro) was perfect in her supportive role; it's always sad to recall how real life turned out so crap for her. Favourite bits: her charming meeting under her umbrella with Rudi and his boots in the rain; Rudi squeezing up the ""chimney"" – I nearly felt the panic. And as a sign of his parts to come I almost wished Lom had ended up stuttering and twitching!All in all, totally inconsequential entertainment, lovely to revel in and regret that not even Planet Disney can be as wholly heartwarming any more."
178,tt0053352,7,"Until I rented it on disc I'd never heard of 'Third Man On The Mountain' - and what a lovely surprise it was.What's not to like? The alpine location photography, abetted by select matte paintings which, for a 1959 film, hold their own against all such in Cameron's 'Titanic,' is simply gorgeous. The solid cast gives rock-solid performances, making 'Third Man On The Mountain' a splendid Disney coming-of-age adventure animated with believable, earnest characters. Through the story's onward and upward progress Ken Annakin's gives sure-handed and sure-footed direction: he has a story to tell, and he orchestrates his actors and camera to tell it.And, oh, I second what my Canadian cousin, ""oldyale6,"" from up there in BC, said in his IMDb review about this film's rock-solid values (we used to call them ideals): this is most definitely a film children ought to enjoy and profit from. 'Third Man On The Mountain' is timeless worthy fare for all."

I am 49 now and I would still watch it many times--if I could only find it.Classic Disney--family oriented, familiar cast from other Disney films, great storyline.

What sets this one above the rest is it does NOT rely on a sound-track to keep the interest of the viewers. Toby is an orphaned boy being raised by his aunt and uncle. His uncle tells him he is a burden, so Toby joins the circus. What makes this movie most entertaining is Toby's horse training!  As I said, this movie does not rely on a sound-track to keep the interest of the viewers, but in fact it is this very aspect that makes it a charm!  As Toby is trained to ride a horse, you see him fail, fail, learn, learn some more, then eventually succeed!  All the time, the only thing you hear is the trot of the horse!"
184,tt0054390,6,"I knew absolutely nothing about this movie when I picked it up off the library shelf. I thought my daughter might watch a few scenes just because she likes the boy from Old Yeller and Swiss Family Robinson. She put it on, and we watched from start to finish, and we've re-watched several times since. It is pure fun, just an enjoyable family film that has somehow been forgotten.Part of what children will like is the animals, especially the chimp Mr. Stubbs. They got some great moments out of him. As an adult, I enjoy it as a period piece. There were some scenes that took place on the Main Street of an early 1900s small town that looked great. The circus workers were colorful characters and very likable. Kevin Corchoran does an amazing job as a kid who runs away to join the circus and has his ups and downs along the way. The story takes place in a more innocent time, and there was a charm in seeing how people might have dealt with these situations in a more innocent time. For example, the nastiest thing the villain does is hide the boy's mail from him. Most of the traveling workers are honest, hard working people, and the movie presents a fairly chaste image of this life. However, there are some moments that some parents may object to, particularly those who are sensitive to images of firearms in family films. Other than one or two non-pc spots, this is a harmless movie that is totally free from irony or the snide, wisecracking characters that fill family movies today."
185,tt0054390,6,"Walt Disney who certainly liked to make films that take place in earlier simpler times like when he was young has Toby Tyler set during the era before World War I at the turn of the last century. Kevin Corcoran plays young Tyler who is an orphan and foster child of his uncle and aunt Tom Fadden and Edith Evanson. When the circus comes to town he neglects chores and when they tell him he's 'millstone around their necks' young Corcoran runs away.The rest of the film tells of Toby's adventures with the circus where he first works for concessionaire Bob Sweeney who has a really nice role as a not so lovable carny who takes really bad advantage of Toby. Fortunately he does not stay under Sweeney's tutelage and makes some real friends in circus strongman Henry Calvin and clown Gene Sheldon.Calvin and Sheldon were from the Disney TV show Zorro and Sheldon played Guy Williams's dumb valet Bernardo. Sheldon was a great pantomime comedian and rarely spoke in his performances on stage, film, or in Zorro. He's great here, but it was nice to hear him. Broke a bit of the illusion, almost like having Harpo Marx talk.And Toby also meets young equestrian performers Dennis Oliveri and Barbara Beird. Beird likes him, but Oliveri is rather full of himself, really odd for someone so young. Toby gets his chance as a performer and to escape Sweeney when Oliveri gets injured showing off.As this is a Disney film naturally it all works out in the end for everyone but Sweeney. And when you see the film I think you'll agree with me that he got off very lightly indeed.Toby Tyler holds up very well after over 50 years, still a nice children's classic."

KEVIN CORCORAN DOES HIS OWN STUNT WORK HERE. so do the other two children. i have read many reviews like Leonard Maltin's and even looked at the wikipedia for this film and nobody points this obvious fact out. i mean what a thing to leave out. if you don't at least mention this you are not giving Kevin Corcoran the true credit he deserves for his outstanding performance. if one more person writes a review of this film without mentioning this i'm gonna scream ""foul""! you might really like the film but if you don't mention this you are being too forgetful, unobservant, and unfair.hopefully one day this minor children's classic will get the good treatment it so richly earns and deserves. it is definitely one of Disney's very best from the studio's golden age. it is very solid film making and even though there might be better films, few films have achieved this kind of neat and tidy perfection. every little element works beautifully.not to mention the film is very cute with an abundance of simple heart. i was surprised to find out the book was so unpleasant. i read 'Toby Tyler' when i was about nine yrs old but i don't seem to remember anything about the book. i certainly didn't remember it was that dark. but i'll take that reviewers word for it. the books themselves are usually darker and grittier than their Disney film adaptations which tend to be more wholesome. i always remembered the film better because i saw the film a few times first. i remember loving the film but not having much of an opinion about the book. probably because i was afraid of it or something.besides an amazing performance by the film's lead, Kevin Corcoran, the film also highlights the wonderful Henry Calvin and Gene Sheldon, two of my favorite Disney performers. they were both cute and funny when teamed up as Laurel and Hardy look alikes for 'Babes in Toyland', but their performances here resonate more warmth and realistic human appeal. especially Calvin, who i think should have been nominated for this. but Disney films were not taken seriously in the ""actor"" categories back then. Kevin Corcoran should have at least been given a special ""outstanding juvenile performance"" award.it's also fun to see veteran Disney Composer/conductor Oliver Wallace in a cameo role as the circus band leader.love the heck out of this film. i first liked it because of the cute monkey 'Mr. Stubbs', but now i appreciate so much more about it's timeless appeal and cheery message. this is one of those Disney ""feel good"" movies that always reminds me why i am such a ""Disney groupie, fanatic""."
187,tt0771329,1,"Given the show was canceled after 3 weeks on NBC, I would assume there would be quite a bit of skepticism around the show. That being said, everyone makes mistakes and NBC made a big one here. Kidnapped has the same complex characters, interesting plots and strong acting that makes 24 such an addictive franchise. But apparently NBC lacks patience and would rather create another lame game show for its programming. Anyway,Kidnapped is a great show. If you like 24, you'll like this show as well. Several strong plot lines - some are more relationship driven (father/son, husband/wife, co-workers, etc.) some are more of your typical action drama related (who are the good guys, who's the mole, etc.), but, for the most part, the plot line are well written and not terribly predictable like many shows on the air these days. The acting is superb as well, throughout the cast. Most of the lead characters are complex and are relatively well developed even though NBC decided to cut the number of episodes down from 22 to 13. If it ever comes out on DVD, check it out."
188,tt0771329,1,"Everything about this series is exceptional, the production values, the casting, and the riveting plot. While most of today's crime dramas seem to center around the same old tried and true CSI and Law and Order formulas of-crime committed, investigation proceeds, cops figure it out and prosecution is executed (within an hour), this series involves the exploration of the affect of the crime on all of the individuals touched by it. The fact that the writers have an entire season to explore reasons, relationships and consequences, gives this show a level of depth that most movies, let alone television series are no where near achieving."
189,tt0771329,1,"I do not really care for TV unless I am absolutely bored and there is nothing better to do, but this show made me drop everything I was doing and just watch in awe. It was by far the greatest show I have ever watched. The acting was superb and I commend all of them on their wonderful jobs. Jeremy Sisto is especially incredible. I have never seen him in anything before, but I will definitely be keeping an eye out for things he is in in the future. I cannot, for the life of me, imagine why NBC would cancel it, but it is their loss. I will definitely be buying the DVD now that I know it is available. I wish NBC would bring it back!"
190,tt0771329,9,"Cancelling this show for whatever reason is beyond me! Luckily somebody put up the remaining episodes for anybody to see! This show was exciting and moving from the start till the end with a hell of a cliffhanger and closure! In that aspect it succeeded where ""Vanished"" failed! The cast is great and the plot is thrilling! The characters all have their good points and flaws! Even the bad guys show their caring side! Which was refreshing to see! So the people portrayed in the show seem very human! It is easy to sympathize with many of the characters which makes the viewing experience more enjoyable! ""Kidnapped"" is full of surprises and never gets boring! This series deserved air time and even continuation for an extra season! Why do these so called experts canceling these great shows? Don't be fooled by their judgment! ""Kidnapped"" is top quality entertainment and drama!"
191,tt0771329,1,"This was the best thing I've seen on TV in a long time. The casting, direction, music..... everything was excellent. It was too bad I had to watch the remaining episodes online at NBC.com, but we were all thankful we could at least see them. NBC made a huge mistake in cancelling this show. This was a show that we all looked forward to week after week. It was not just another Law & Order. Even though I love Law & Order, it is just so predictable. That's what made Kidnapped great....all of the twists and turns. We are all hoping it comes out on DVD. I'll buy it even though I've already seen it .... especially if they add back in episodes that were not shown! :)"
192,tt0771329,1,"Kidnapped is a show that will keep you asking questions thats for sure! From the 1st show I couldn't take my eyes off,and I keep coming back for more , Will Leopold get away ? will he make friends with Otto an get help from him ? Does Sully have anything to do with Leopolds kidnapping ? Will Conrads Dad help from a far to close the gap of father an son ? Will the Mom play a bigger role in the family secrets? No wonder it takes a whole season for this all to play out !! Did Knapp get someone killed is that why he's not a agent anymore ? This show gives you a look into the family of the victim, lets you get to know some history of these people and understand how it effects them.Kidnapped does not just jump in and show you whats going on , it lets you get to know others that may have some shady past and dealings with the Cains, it tells you a story if your willing to see the out come of this show for the season you will be pleased and come back for more. I can't wait, I keep coming back for more it's my NBC addiction ! Check outkidnapped on Nbc Wednesdays... Might be moving to Saturdays 9/8."
193,tt0771329,1,"This was too great of a show to be canceled! Nbc made a BAD decision to cancel it without giving enough time for people to discover this excellent drama. Even though it is now canceled and they even stopped showing the episodes online at nbc.com, there have been tons of newcomers who join the Kidnapped board on nbc.com. Please join us if you would like to see Kidnapped return for a new season =). The characters are ALL well thought out and played really well by the actors. Especially Will Denton, for a ""child"" actor, he REALLY can act! GOOD JOB!!!! He really has a great future in acting. This was a much better show than Heroes! BRING KIDNAPPED BACK NBC!!!"
194,tt0771329,1,"Viewers hooked on Kidnapped, which was far-too-quickly yanked from NBC's 2006 fall line-up, watched a superb cast that included Jeremy Sisto, Delray Lindo, Dana Delaney and Timothy Hutton, play out the multiple twists and turns of this suspenseful thriller on-line. Will Denton delivered a focused, utterly believable performance as Leo Cain, the 15-year-old kidnap victim, who played a gripping psychological cat-and-mouse game for survival with his captors, brilliantly portrayed by Robert John Burke and Otto Sanchez. Even secondary characters had gripping back stories and the acting was uniformly excellent. The plot kept viewers guessing and stressing. When and if Sony provides a Kidnapped DVD, SNAP IT UP!"
195,tt0771329,1,"I've just finished watching this excellent series and cannot believe that it was cancelled mid-way through it's run in the USA, and after the ambiguous end to series 1 it is not been picked up for another series. It has been a while since there has been such an intelligent, complex and well acted show on TV. This show could have run and run in the same way 24 does, as the premise is quite similar. All of the actors involved were exemplary but hats off to Jeremy Sisto as the anti-hero Knapp and what I believe was the best acting seen on TV by an actress this year in Dana Delaney....every single word she spoke rang true from the off. Ultimately very disappointed but happy to have seen the one series available. Thnaks Channel 4 in the UK for airing a show they knew had been cancelled."
196,tt0771329,1,"I sent the following message to site (http://members.optusnet.com.au/nickhalloway/episodes.htm) streaming last episodes: Thanks to your terrific site my wife and I were able to watch all of Kidnapped (just finished day 13).It is simply unbelievable how stupid the major networks were in cancelling this in N. America. We hope it comes out on DVD the same way Firefly, Boomtown and Wonderfalls did.Many thanks and happy New Year.Trevor and Donna Montreal--------------This series felt like, and was as good as Man on Fire. The writing and acting was tight; the full story and denouement were amazing. When viewers chase (on the internet) after episodes promised and not delivered by the networks then the quality was evident. Only most will never know how good the story and series were, and what it potential was."
197,tt0054195,8,"A vast improvement on the cutesy, blatantly unrealistic and cliched story on which it is based, the Disney film Pollyanna is a truly enjoyable, BELIEVABLE film.  It has a very charming, nostalgic feel to it.  The period costumes and sets are very good, and the direction is good, too.  The best thing about it, however, are the performances.  The talented cast really makes you believe in them and forget they're all stereotypes.  Jane Wyman is quite good as Aunt Polly, as are Agnes Moorehead, Adolphe Menjou, and espicially Karl Malden.  And Hayley Mills more than holds her own, giving a very good, subtle, believable performance.  This Pollyanna does not spend all her time chatting her mouth off and misinterpreting every cold act of her aunt's as an expression of love, which made her very annoying in the book, but rather, she really gets to know people and very subtly brings out the best in them.  A truly good family film, much better than the book, and one really worth viewing."
198,tt0054195,9,"As Pollyanna would say, the movie is simply ""gorgeous""! In my 57 years I've seen this movie more times than I should admit. Just watched it again on Hallmark and felt compelled to offer my first comments on IMDb.Everyone can feel down, lonely or put upon at one time or another. ""Pollyanna"" is just the right medicine for those ailments. I realize this is early Disney, but that is a positive attribute, not an indictment. Cheezy? How about ""touching"" instead? The cast, the performances, the setting, and most of all, the message are right on. The film makes me laugh and cry every time I view it. How could you possibly ask for more? Guess I'm just a soft touch. Highly recommended for all but the terminally cynical."
199,tt0054195,1,"A period piece that boasts about ""The Glad Game?""  Ready to tune out?  So was I, until I got what was happening.  This movie is profound, not only in its execution of story, but in the relevant, lovely message it naturally brings, as opposed to the message it sells.  I've viewed it 5 times and each time, I am newly informed as to how I can adjust my attitude for a better way of life.  I come from a school of thought where sunny is ridiculed and message movies are tedious, so the lead is an obvious target of disdain. Stay with Pollyanna awhile and watch her reform all the bitter, crusty malcontents on the planet into fans with a straightforward logic and uncanny point of view.  A true heroine."
200,tt0053977,8,"This is the last of Disney's A TRUE-LIFE ADVENTURE Feature. It follows a female jaguar in the Amazon as well as the wild life world she comes in contact with. There's the wild Iguazu Falls before it's over-run by tourists. The sloth is endearing and a real eye-opener back then. The lengthy battle between the jaguar and the anaconda is epic.This is an old style nature film. Disney has been called out for manipulating footage. Certainly, they humanized the animals to make them relateable. It's an old fashion concept. Old photographs of Civil War battlefields were manipulated as much as these films. It was another era. While one can talk about some of these deficiencies, one also cannot deny the wide-spread appeal of these films and its influence on nature-conservation."
201,tt0053977,8,"I give it a high rating considering that Disney was a pioneer in nature films as family entertainment. Decades before the Discovery Channel, Disney and his filmmakers were winning awards for these films. Cinematography has come a long way in the ensuing 58 years, but this film captures close ups and action shots of the wildlife without giving the viewer headaches. Just compare anything Disney did in the 40s and 50s to the entertaining 1974 nature film ""Animals are Beautiful People"". I loved the jokes, but I hated the headache I got from the blurred photography that simply could not keep up with the motion of the animals. Now back to the story.The film's main focus is a spotted female jaguar living in the South American jungle who chooses a black male jaguar as a mate and produces two cubs - one being identical to dad and one identical to mom. They are portrayed as being a family unit throughout the film, probably to humanize them so people could relate, even though jaguars actually separate after mating. To supplement the footage of the jaguars, there is a discussion of many of the animals living in this ecosystem including the otter, the capybara ( a rodent), the monkeys - who are vegetarians and live in the treetops - who tease the sloth, and the tapir, which is a favorite prey of the jaguar. It is these other animals who, though fascinating, act as filler for the story of the jungle cat. The finale of the film shows the adult male jaguar in a face off with a giant boa constrictor, and where they fight very definitely determines the outcome of the battle.I'd recommend this one as it is still entertaining today both in its form and substance."
202,tt0053977,5,"This is a famous Walt Disney documentary, on the Amazon Rainforest and its Jaguar. I found that most of the scenes were edited to make a humanized appearance of the animals. In its day, this film was something special. Today it is historic to Disney lovers. Accustomed to watching the Discover Channel and Animal Planet, it appears hokey, much like John Ford's Battle of Midway. It contains some great footage that was either staged or edited to add character to this documentary. Disney must have wanted to portray animals as humans, there is a family of jaguars that are the main characters in this film. Seems to me that Reptiles are the bad guys in most of his documentaries. Human traits are the common thread in these Disney films, more about the human way of life applied to nature. All in all it is a historic film worth an hour of your time, even for a good laugh at the voice overs."
203,tt0053977,7,"First-rate nature documentary from Disney with lots of amazing footage which captures the Amazon jungle life up close in a way that could hardly be improved upon even with the help of today's more advanced technology. There are exciting fight scenes (the film does not shy away from the violence inherent in nature), moments of comedy and playful tenderness, and a variety of beautiful and/or strange creatures (those sloths certainly live up to their name!) *** out of 4."
204,tt0053977,7,"Saw this film back in the 60's, when I was around 8/9 years old, and I was very impressed by the amazing filming of two jaguars hunting together and tackling crocodile,anteater and anaconda. Back then such footage was very rare and this film became a top favourite of mine- 10/10 . But, as an adult I now believe that it must surely have been staged and, as jaguars are such hard to film creatures, then perhaps more than two animals were filmed and lots of smart cutting and editing used. But, still... 7/10..."
205,tt0053977,6,"I was a little surprised to see how low the rating for Walt Disney's Jungle Cat was. We are a little spoiled with the creation of shows like Planet Earth and the advancements in technology. In my opinion, for a film from 1959, Jungle Cat is a pretty cool documentary. In just over an hour, you are introduced to a number of different animals, and you get to observe quite a few unique situations. If you combined today's technology with the scenes that were captured in '59, I think you would have some much better viewer ratings. If you are a Disney history nerd, you've got to imagine Jungle Cat is exactly what Walt set out for in his nature films. Jungle Cat is well worth the watch (so long as you don't constantly compare it to Planet Earth)."
233,tt0310778,7,"An interesting pairing of stories, this little flick manages to bring together seemingly different characters and story lines all in the backdrop of WWII and succeeds in tying them together without losing the audience. I was impressed by the depth portrayed by the different characters and also by how much I really felt I understood them and their motivations, even though the time spent on the development of each character was very limited. The outstanding acting abilities of the individuals involved with this picture are easily noted. A fun, stylized movie with a slew of comic moments and a bunch more head shaking events.7/10"
206,tt0054372,7,"Many of the Disney live-action films from the 50's and 60's are too easily derided these days for their sepia-toned view of the past, and American past in particular. The main example of this would be Disney's interpretation of Davy Crockett. But without Walt's enthusiasm for the creation of America and it's people many a folk hero would be lost in time. So even though Disney may have painted a sugar-coated vision of these stories at least they were brought to the attention of a wider audience who could then discover them for real.Ten Who Dared is a perfect example of this with it's exploration (pun intended) of the adventures of John Wesley Powell and his team who were the first people to explore and chart the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon in 1869.As you can expect they get in to some scrapes with Native Americans as well as the river itself and a rebellion in the camp has some dire consequences.Although the film may not sit with the best westerns ever made it is a fun journey, with a group of characters recognisable to any fan of men- on-a-mission movies, and is a great way to spend 90 minutes and learn some American history at the same time."
207,tt0054372,6,"Ten Who Dared is a purportedly factual account of the John Wesley Powell expedition of 1869 exploring the Colorado River and its tributaries. In the course of that trip Powell became if not the first white man to see the Grand Canyon, the first to plot its exact location on our globe.Now how much license the Disney Studios took with the expedition is open to interpretation. I suspect there was some license taken to make it an interesting story for the juvenile audience it was primarily marketed for.John Beal plays the one armed former major in the union army who was with its topographical corps and who spent the Civil War surveying and map making for the top Union brass. It's where he lost his right arm. James Drury plays his younger brother Walter who has his own set of issues regarding the late war where he was in Andersonville prison. He and former Confederate Ben Johnson have their conflict which is one of the subplots.Brian Keith plays one of his patented frontier characters who leads a mutiny among the men who are not sure when or if they'll come to the end of the Colorado gorge. Keith is always interesting in any film and right about now he was in about every other Disney film out there, or at least every one that Fred MacMurray wasn't or so it seemed back when I was a lad.Nice location cinematography is the most distinguishing feature of Ten Who Dared. I think more than a juvenile audience will appreciate this film."
208,tt0054372,1,"Supposedly factual account of the first group of men to explore the mysterious Colorado River, led by one-armed Civil War Major John Wesley Powell. Disney-made adventure isn't well-produced or well-written, but it does have a sort of ambling charm. Brian Keith is terrific as usual playing a grizzled amateur astrologist, Ben Johnson lends his solid support, but who is responsible for casting John Beal as Powell? He's unbearably wooden and has about as much screen-appeal as a desert tortoise. Overall, pretty slack, and not likely to engage youngsters."
209,tt0054372,7,"Good enough, though definitely could've been better.'Ten Who Dared' is pretty reminiscent of 1959's 'Third Man on the Mountain', with a dangerous exploration being riddled with in-house arguments. In comparison to that, I think this is inferior. There's still enough here to enjoy, albeit marginally.I didn't really connect with any of the characters, none of the actor performances blew me away either. John Beal as Major Powell is the most likeable, alongside David Stollery's Andy. The one who I actually rated most, though, is Brian Keith as Bill - not so much the character, more so Keith himself.The shots of the Colorado River and its surroundings look pretty nice, but overall this film is just missing things that stop it from being greater. I've seen worse from Disney, that's for sure."
210,tt0055254,8,"A large part of Disney's triumph cannot be detected by the naked eye.  His last animated film had been `Sleeping Beauty', which was the most extravagant and spectacular animated film of all time (excluding `Fantasia').  It wasn't a financial success.  `101 Dalmatians', much less extravagant, was.  In the two years between `Sleeping Beauty' and its successor there had been a revolution.  The entire army of inkers who had carefully translated animators' pencil drawings into smooth, flowing lines were replaced by a machine that simply photocopied.  This changed the character of animation so much that `Dalmatians' is almost the precise opposite of `Beauty'.  Outlines are rough and black; the entire film looks decidedly drawn rather than painted, even the bits that are in fact painted; and the rich variety of colour of Disney's earlier films has been replaced with the stark white-with-black-spots coat of a dalmatian, with the occasional splash of startling red.  The art directors were as determined to get the most out of the new technology as they had been to get the most out of the old technology. And it has its own quiet extravagance.  A title promising over one hundred spotted dogs was (probably still is) the kind of thing liable to make animators feel faint.  It couldn't have been done without the photocopier; and even so, getting spots to stay in the right place on a featureless white background is a huge headache.  None of this leaps out an audience.  We simply see a hundred adorable dogs.The story is simple, clean, civilised, and warm.  It moves slowly but this doesn't matter.  Preventing the film from becoming lethargic is Cruella de Vil.  She can drive like a maniac through the snow, smoke a cigarette through a holder the length of a sword, wave her arms like a windmill ... yet she handles quiet determination and gritted teeth equally well. Character animation doesn't get any better than this."
211,tt0055254,9,"If there's any classic Disney movie that's less likely to be forgotten because of the modern Disney movies, this would be one of them. Part of the reason may be the live action version and its upcoming sequel. Skip those remakes and watch the real deal. The other part of the reason is because this movie is just so charming. Cruella De Vil is one of the more memorable Disney villains ever made. Romance abounds in this movie, and don't forget those adorable puppies. This may not have the animation or the big fancy songs of the moderns, but all that fanciness usually distracts from the story. Classic Disney always rocks, and this is no exception."
212,tt0055254,1,"101 Dalmatians is, no doubt, my all-time favourite story and also one of the greatest films I have ever seen. When I was small, I never got tired to listen to or to read the story, and because of thinking especially much about Cruella de Vil I very early noticed that in fact I like wicked characters. But, of course, the unforgettable dogs are best in the film. Because of this story I have loved real Dalmatians all my life and also thought that only the names of the film's dog figures are really suitable for Dalmatians. I have also read Dodie Smith's original story, and I was really glad that it's so much like the Disney film."
213,tt0055254,1,"When two Dalmatians named Pongo (Rod Taylor) and Perdita (Cate Bauer) are blessed with fifteen puppies, they couldn't have been happier. But when their new family gets stolen, along with eighty-four other puppies by the evil fashion designer Cruella De Vil (Betty Lou Gerson) for the intention of making fur coats out of them, Pongo and Perdita must call on numerous other animals to help them rescue the puppies from their fate. Important in animation history as the first Disney animated film to heavily use newer xerography methods for the purpose of cheaper animation methods, One Hundred and One Dalmatians may lack the visual beauty of Disney's earlier fantasy films, but the modern UPA style of the film helps it stand out as one of the most visually unique films of the 1960's. The infamous Cruella, thanks to Marc Davis's incredible character animation and Betty Lou Gerson's piercing voice makes her one of the most memorable villians of all time and despite a lot of it would end up being reused for numourous films produced during this cost-cutting era, George Bruns's score is fabulous with the best example of his work being the jazz-inspired opening credits that would set the mood for the more laid-back films of this time period. Overall, One Hundred and One Dalmatians deserves it's reputation as not only one of the most important films in the companies history, but also as a fun thrill ride for all ages."
214,tt0055254,9,"One of Dodie Smith's friends once looked at the novelist's dalmatians and said: ""Those dogs would make a lovely fur coat!"" It's this single phrase that inspired Mrs. Smith and led her to write what was about to become her most popular and influential novel: ""The Hundred and One Dalmatians"". I don't know who was this friend and what was he/she doing for living and what was his/her name. But whoever this person is, he/she inadvertently changed popular culture forever. This shows at which point the simplest sentences can become monumental.Smith's novel was adapted by none other than Mr. Americana himself, Walt Disney. ""101 Dalmatians"" was Disney's first work of the '60s, the last decade of his life, but it doesn't mean that old age slowed him anyway.It is Disney's 17th animated-feature film and 7th focusing on furry animal characters. It's the story of Pongo and Perdita, a dalmatian couple, whose puppies have been kidnapped by Cruella De Vil, one of the most cruel and diabolical characters portrayed by Disney and his crew. Cruella collected every dalmatian she could, so she would be able to make a fur coat from them. But Cruella didn't plan that Pongo, Perdita and a whole network of animal companions would unite their efforts in order to win back the puppies and get home safely.As previously said, Cruella is by far the most interesting character of the lot. We never know how Perdita's mistress Anita became friend with Cruella, but we guess that Cruella's not interested in Anita: she only wants the dalmatian. Cruella has a scary look. She looks like an old witch. She doesn't respect anyone and she's only interested in her desires. That's what makes Cruella one of the creepiest and most interesting villains of Disney's universe.But my predilection goes to the puppies themselves, which are absolutely adorable and charming. My favorite scenes are those where Pongo, Perdita and their 15 puppies watch a western on TV.We don't get to know each one of the 15 puppies, but some are highlighted. There's Patch, who is probably the group rebel, with his black spot on his eyes and his love for hard words; there's Rolly, whose favorite phrase is: ""I'm hungry"" and there's Lucky who looks like the precursor of Generation X, because he always got the nose on the TV.The viewer is also introduced to the dogs' own communication system: the ""twilight bark"", which looks like a large-scale Chinese whispers game. This is wildly imaginative and it's one of the most fascinating aspects of the dogs' own world.Outside of the dalmatians, my favorite animal characters are the ""military shed"": a horse called Captain, a sheepdog called Colonel and, last but not least, Sgt. Tibbs, a courageous cat who is assigned to save the puppies from their countryside prison.Cruella is sided by two stupid and running-gag henchmen, Jasper and Horace. These two foolish guys provide most of the film's laughs and they're not too overshadowed by their horrible boss.Animation, even if it doesn't break any ground, is excellent, but not perfect. Victorian houses of London are well pictured, but it's not exceptional. It's the animals who are the best drawn. The dalmatians weren't easy to draw, because they don't have a uniform fur. Artists had to draw them white and then adding the black spots over and over, during 70 minutes of screen time. It must have been a monumental task.Every classical Disney aspect is here: drama (the main plot), comedy (Horace & Jasper and some secondary/tertiary events), fearsome elements (Cruella), suspense (Sgt. Tibbs' puppies rescue) and action (the climatic car chase). And let's not forget some potentially symbolic images, such as the dalmatians' long walk in the blizzard and the puppies watching TV.Also a thumbs-up for the music, and especially for the Cruella's title song. The soundtrack is mainly made from jazzy parts and it's very adequate.Another feature, another classic. Walt Disney never deceives us. After this film, we became more familiar with two elements, both from the title. First, the number 101, when heard, is almost instinctively associated with this movie, and so is the dalmatian dog itself. It's another success that both parents and children will like for generations to come."
215,tt0055254,8,"One Hundred and One Dalmatians is a classic Disney film from the company's brilliant late 50's and early 60's period. The film has a number of Disney high points including fantastic supporting characters, great suspense and a heavy atmosphere. The film can be considered another excellent feature for the legendary company.The story sees Dalmatian Pongo and his 'pet' Roger find love with two of their kind in Perdita and Anita. When Perdita gives birth to 15 puppies the cruel Cruella De Vil wishes to buy them but is turned away. With the help of her bumbling henchmen she kidnaps the puppies in order to make fur coats of them. Its then up to Pongo and Perdita, with the help of a collection of animals, to find the puppies and return to London. The story is simplistic but wonderfully executed. It has so many great elements that make it such an engaging movie, from the way dogs view their owners to the many escape attempts. The characters are superb. Rod Taylor is perfect as the very likable Pongo who we see as brave and caring as the film goes on. The relationship between him and Perdita is better than most as they do care for each other. Cruella is one of Disney's stronger villains, it's the way she is so crazed and manic but always trying to be stylish that makes her so entertaining. Jasper and Horace are brilliant henchmen, supplying lots of fun comic relief. Their so inept and clumsy that there's never a dull moment with them. The team of the Colonel, Tibbs and the Captain are brilliant. The Colonel is lovingly silly and Tibbs is so likable due to his never say die attitude. Roger and Anita are good as they are presented as a normal pleasant couple. The other dogs that help out like Danny the Great Dane and Towser are nice, solid supporting characters.Though the rougher animation isn't to everyone's taste it does fit in really well here. The way it looks fits in with the gritty darkness of London and the wilds of the countryside, it's a nice change from the angular style of the films preceding it. When you consider the amount of puppies they had to animate it's an impressive feat. It is certainly one of the Disney's most suspense filled and exciting films. It's not very often that a Disney climax has a car chase and it's an outstanding sequence. The whole search for the puppies has a brilliantly tense feel and watching Cruella search for them has some really well made strong moments. This leads on to another highlight which is the atmosphere the film has. The whole 'twilight bark' is a great piece and the scenes where Tibbs and the Colonel investigate the matter have a really effective dark feel. These are underlined by the superb visuals of a gloomy London and the demonic looking 'hell hall'. The music is also very memorable as it contains the usual solid score Disney does, as well as the fantastic songs ''Cruella De Vil'' and ''Dalmatian Plantation''. The other effective scenes include a humorous look at how dog owners are similar to their pets and the what's my crime TV show that's funny. This is one of Disney's most entertaining movies filled with many great elements."
216,tt0054594,8,"The Absentminded Professor was the second film that Fred MacMurray in his second career rebirth with Walt Disney as the midwife. He scored an enormous success in The Shaggy Dog and Disney films together with his My Three Sons TV series established MacMurray as the quintessential family father figure which would endure for the rest of his life.I do remember seeing this in the theater back as a youngster and back then the younger ones in the crowd were looking at Tommy Kirk who was at the height of his Disney popularity. Nevertheless MacMurray gives a delightful performance as science professor Ned Brainerd who's accidentally invented a variation on rubber which has a great deal more bounce to it.He's so wrapped up in his experiment that he's even forgetting his wedding day to Nancy Olson, AGAIN. She's about had it with him and ready to fall for the wolfish English professor Elliott Reid.MacMurray has his own troubles. Other than helping his college win a basketball game with a team that they are way overmatched against, he's not quite decided what use this stuff he calls flubber is good for. But wealthy Keenan Wynn sure wants to get his hands on it.Funniest sequence in the film is Keenan Wynn after MacMurray and Olson trick him into wearing flubberized shoes is seeing bounce slowly into the stratosphere before a quick thinking Tommy Kirk devises a way to counteract his flubberized dad.The AbsentMinded Professor was so popular with audiences that Disney did another version with almost the entire same cast in Son of Flubber.That one was almost as funny, but this still has a lot of laughs even after almost fifty years."
217,tt0120783,7,"There is only one movie in history that I can name that my wife, my mother and my six-year-old daughter enjoyed equally. This is it.This is an astonishly effective and pleasant remake of a very good film. It's light, romantic, touching and downright funny. You cannot pour enough accolades on young Lindsay Lohan, who effortlessly plays both twins, and, if you listen closely, juggles four accents. (She changes her Brit accent when she plays her own American alter-ego pretending to be herself in England - if you saw the film, you know what I mean).Natasha Richardson and Dennis Quaid with that big, goofy, infectious smile, give the film its romance and maturity, without stepping on the fun-filled kid's plot. This is simple, easy-to-watch family entertainment.There is also a great editing and effects element. You never once notice a split screen or cheap over-the-shoulder shot when both of Lohan's characters are on-screen - its really quite astounding how seamless it is.My daughter, after seeing this in the theater, quickly proclaimed this her favourite movie ever. We own the video, and I have watched it with her at least a dozen times without growing tired.A perfect rental after a bad day, or when you want to have a family movie night. *** out of ****."
218,tt0055232,1,"One thing can be said about Disney in the 50s and 60s, and that is it put out some great films with animal stars, from the True-Life Adventure series to ""Old Yeller"" and others.  This film combines a True-Life filmmaking approach with a good adventure story, and the result is entertaining family fare.  The Malamute and the bear cub are adorable!  Both adventure and nature commentary are shown, combined with gorgeous on-location photography (filmed in Canada) and a nice music score."
219,tt0055232,9,"I know most people think the Disney live-action movies of the 1960s were a rather pathetic bunch, made only to cash in on the organization's name...but if that's true, how do you explain their appeal?  -Nikki- is a perfectly good film, with some amazing scenes of interaction between a Malamute pup and a bear cub.  The setting--northern Canada--is lovely enough to captivate people, and of course it's a nice flick to show to your kids. One word of caution:  some of the people portrayed in the ""mining town"" are a rowdy bunch, so you might want to wait 'til the kids are over 5 before you show 'em...just in case they start asking questions.  (Don't worry, it's *rated* ""G"".)"
220,tt0055232,7,"This movie is based on ""Nomads of the North"" by James Oliver Curwood, who also wrote ""King Grizzly"", which was made into the movie ""The Bear"".Nikki, a malamute that's 1/8 wolf, and his kind fur trapper owner encounter an orphaned bear cub. The cub and puppy initially don't get along. An overturned canoe separates them, while tethered together, from their master, and they set out on their own in a ""Defiant Ones"" sequence that shows their different approaches to survival in the wild. The puppy wants to hunt critters, but can't catch any due to the cub stubbornly anchoring the other end of the tether. The cub tears into a rotten tree stump to get at a beehive, but the puppy runs away after getting stung, dragging the cub along with him. The cub climbs a tree to sleep, resulting in the puppy trying to snooze with his rear end slung a foot off the ground. After a number of weeks they escape their tether and become friends, until the bear hibernates, and Nikki heads out on his own. Over a year or so, he grows up, gets into scuffles with a wolverine, and tries to join a wolf pack who let him know violently that he's not welcome. Eventually Nikki gets captured by an evil fur trader who beats him into an aggressive pit fighting dog. At the movie's end, his original owner confronts a snarling bloodthirsty Nikki, but both eventually recognize each other, and resume their friendly travels.NOTE - there are many fights in this movie: bear vs bear, Nikki vs wolverine, wolverine vs lynx, Nikki vs wild wolves, Nikki vs wolf-dog, and even good fur trader vs bad fur trader, and a number of ""dead"" animals are shown. An Indian is treated in typically poor 60's cinematic fashion as well, although he is shown as noble and smart, becoming a companion to Nikki and the good fur trader at the end.All -in -all though, this is a Disney dog movie that deserves to be a little better remembered. The DVD I saw was put out by a company named Anchor Bay, and not Disney, so there were no extra features at all. This, combined with Disney's ""Alaska Sled Dog"" from 1957 would make a good Disney DVD package."
221,tt0055232,8,"I remember loving to watch this movie on Wonderful World of Disney as a kid. It's about a malamute puppy who becomes separated from his master. He befriends an orphaned bear cub named Neewah and the two are together for about a year. After Neewah starts hibernating, Nikki is very lonely and seeks out the companionship of wolves, but is rejected.I thought it was a very dramatic movie for being about an animal. It shows how a dog passes through the hands of two masters, one kind and one cruel. How easily trust can be shattered and how things must be put right again. The friendship between the dog and the bear was great too because they had to compromise in such things as diet and sleeping position.I'd definitely recommend this movie for a kid I loved, especially one who loves dogs."
222,tt0055232,7,"I watched ""Nikki"" (1961) and ""Benji the Hunted"" (1987) back-to-back today, and since there are not enough things to say about those two films in two separate reviews, it's better to compare them in one. They have very similar storylines (a dog tries to survive in the wilderness) and they are both primarily aimed at kids, but the quality levels differ: ""Nikki"" (**1/2) is a simple, straightforward, adventurous, well-made Disney tale, while ""Benji the Hunted"" (*1/2) is a sleep-inducing one.  Voice-over narration is often regarded as an annoying gimmick, but the narrator in ""Nikki"" has a very pleasant voice and agreeable material to work with, while ""Benji"" omits the narration entirely and replaces it with an obtrusive, often inappropriate music score. In short, ""Nikki"" is much better."
223,tt0055232,7,"'Nikki, Wild Dog of the North"" is a live action animal film typical of the Disney studios in the sixties. Its stars are a dog that is part wolf (Nikki) and a bear, who grow up together. This is a story that feels like a Jack London tale, full of adventure and celebrating the natural world.The filmmakers impose their story on some real action sequences and, probably, also stage their animal ""stars"" to conform to the desired story. A voice over is used to pull the parts of the story together and to provide human interpretations of animal behaviors. This anthropomorphism, while a large part of what makes the film enjoyable for some, trades in common misconceptions of animals and furthers inaccurate beliefs about animal psychology. When the narrator says the dog feels certain emotions or make judgments based upon rational decisions, it obscures the real nature of the animal. While children will find much of the story adorable and engaging, they should be disabused of the conceit that the animals have thought processes like humans. Besides, it is not necessary for dogs to think and feel like humans for them to be good companions.While the interactions between some of the animals usually can be explained by the filmmakers imposing their story on natural behavior, one has to wonder about the scenes involving the dog and a wolverine or the dog and some rats. Were any animals harmed in the making of this film or were animals put in harm's way?In the end, there are some incredibly beautiful scenes of nature, including towering mountains and lovely blue waters in all seasons. And the values inherent in this film are kindness and respect for life."
224,tt0055232,7,"Nikki is a malamute / wolf hybrid (the narration informs us that he's 1/8th wolf) who's the devoted companion to late 19th century French-Canadian trapper Andre Dupas (Jean Coutu). One day, after they've acquired a black bear cub as a third member of the group, their canoe capsizes in some rapids, and the man and the animals are separated. The bulk of the tale details what happens as Nikki and the cub (dubbed Neewa) form a friendship and survive in the wilderness together.The novel ""Nomads of the North"" by James Oliver Curwood (whose writings were also the basis for the 1989 film ""The Bear"") seems ideal fare for the Disney company, if perhaps a little intense and violent at times for the youngest of children. But there is still very little blood, and there are a steady parade of engaging animal characters (including a mean-tempered grizzly) to keep younger viewers enchanted. Ultimately, the film is one of those appealing tales that either enriches our appreciation for nature, or helps to develops it. The scenery (this was actually filmed in the Canadian wilderness) is as beautiful as one would expect it to be, and the pacing & storytelling pretty succinct. (This only runs an hour and 14 minutes). The final portions, with Nikki forced into a brief bout of dog-fighting, will be uncomfortable for members of the audience.This does come off as a little cheesy and precious at times (with amusing, genial narration spoken by Jacques Fauteux), so it likely won't be to all tastes, but the animal action is top-notch. The animals are actually more engaging than the human characters, who aren't really fleshed out. All you need to know about trapper Jacques Lebeau (Emile Genest) is that he's a very bad man. Uriel Luft plays Lebeaus' Indian companion Makoki, a much more kind-hearted individual. Nikki himself is simply adorable.Written by Ralph Wright & producer Winston Hibler, and directed by Jack Couffer (also one of the cinematographers) and Don Haldane. Since the cast members were French-Canadian, they did the dubbing for the French-language version.Seven out of 10."
225,tt0055232,7,"Scripted nature film from Walt Disney seamlessly mixes wildlife footage with the engrossing, entertaining story of Nikki, a Malamute dog (1/8 wolf) separated from his owner in the Canadian Rockies after rescuing an orphaned bear cub up a tree. The unlikely bond between dog and bear survives different methods of sleeping and hunting for an amusing effect (the film is very careful not to dwell on the carcasses). But when winter comes and the bear must hibernate, Nikki forges off alone and is nabbed by a trapper who wants to use him for dog fighting. The animals are marvelous, though the cinematographers (all five of them, including William W. Bacon III, Lloyd Beebe, Ray Jewell, Donald Wilder and Jack Couffer, who also co-directed) are the stars this time. Jacques Fauteux provides a warm and funny narration, and Oliver Wallace's background score is very lively. The different types of film used is noticeable on occasion, and the speed is played with (slowed down or sped up) a few times; otherwise, a first-rate family product from the studio, one with the requisite tug at the heart at the finish line. *** from ****"
226,tt0055232,4,"More of a documentary than a film.The premise, or at least the stuff that holds it together, to 'Nikki, Wild Dog of the North' is rather light; particularly for the first and second acts, the third has a little more meat on the bones.There's also extremely questionable animal welfare, a lot of it could be trained but it's difficult not to be cynical with some of the stuff you see - especially across the opening twenty minutes. It affected my enjoyment, way more than a few other Disney films with similar issues.Cast-wise it's almost non-existent, Jean Coutu and Émile Genest are solid as Andre and Jacques respectively. Jacques Fauteux narrates the film, he is arguably the only good part to this - his delivery is near perfect.I can't honestly say I liked this as I simply didn't, the animal stuff alongside the weak plot makes for uninteresting viewing. Each to their own, as always."
227,tt0056249,6,"While the technical aspects of this ""space age"" comedy from the early 1960's are understandably dated, the major problem with watching ""Moon Pilot"" now lies in its slow pacing. Virtually every scene runs longer than it should and the conversations within each scene are too often marked by needless pauses and languid delivery. The result is a 70-minute story that's been s-t-r-e-t-c-h-e-d into a 98-minute movie.Tom Tryon seems an unusual choice for the title role. His dark, brooding, sexually-ambiguous looks would qualify him to play ""Heathcliff"" but ""Moon Pilot"" is virtually his only foray into farcical comedy. However, his innately serious quality helps him to anchor the movie more securely than would a Dick Van Dyke or a Dean Jones, but he really doesn't shine in this kind of material. His image as a juicy slab of ""beefcake"" remains intact, however, since even this family-oriented Disney comedy finds an excuse to strip him down to his boxer shorts in order to display his hairy chest in two separate scenes."
228,tt0056249,7,"I'd missed out on this one as both as a VHS rental and on local TV in the past but which, bafflingly, hasn't been available anywhere else (not even on DVD) until nowor, perhaps, not so strange  since it's considered pretty much an outdated early movie about the space program!That said, the film has always enjoyed a reputation as one of the better Walt Disney live-action efforts  an opinion I was happy to share after watching it for myself (especially given my recent disappointment with such other popular albeit ultra-juvenile fare as THE GNOME-MOBILE [1967] and the two ""Witch Mountain"" outings). In fact, this has very few concessions to the typical Disney 'cuteness' (basically extending to the inevitable romance and an over-eager member at the space center breaking into a would-be hip ""Go, man, go!"" routine with every shuttle launch) and is clearly elevated by the presence of strong actors  Tom Tryon is ideally cast in the lead, though it's Brian Keith as his constantly exasperated superior and Edmond O'Brien as the dogged yet bewildered Federal Security man who dominate much of the proceedings (especially when the two engage in shouting matches between themselves).Anyway, as can be gleaned from the title, the plot involves attempts by the U.S. to orbit the moon: the first guinea-pig is a chimp which, however, goes berserk on returning home; undeterred, a human volunteer is requested  Tryon, of course (though he's actually air-sick!). Soon after, he begins to be followed by a petite girl of obvious foreign origins (Dany Saval, whose gaucheness starts off by being corny but eventually proves disarming)  who not only knows all about his supposedly top-secret mission but actively wants to impart to him vital information about his safety 'up there'; however, he believes her to be a spy and tries his best to avoid her! Still, she manages to turn up at the most unexpected places (even after O'Brien has him 'kidnapped' to a hotel) and eventually confesses to being an alien  clearly possessing advanced knowledge and who, atypically for the sci-fi genre, intends to extend help to Earth people rather than conquer them! MOON PILOT, then, resorts agreeably to such well-worn albeit effective suspense/spy movie trappings as the ""McGuffin"" (in the form of the missing element which would allow humans to adapt to the atmosphere in outer space), chases, impersonation and, it goes without saying, the growing affection between hero and heroine thrown into this unusual situation. Apart from the obvious space gadgetry, the sci-fi aspect of the film is evident in the scene in which, to demonstrate her powers, Saval gives Tryon a foretaste of his/their future. As always with Disney films, however, comedy is as much an intrinsic ingredient of the formula: best of all are the running 'unreliable elevator' gag with Tryon and O'Brien, and the potentially campy suspects' line-up of beatniks (under whose guise Saval has descended to Earth  clearly a sign of the times). Keith's queasy look during the latter sequence is pricelessas is his final flustered off-screen outburst when Tryon and Saval sign off in space courtesy of a Sherman Brothers love song!"
229,tt0056249,3,"I never did get around to seeing Moon Pilot back when it was in theaters when I was a lad. Looking at it now, I'm sure glad I didn't waste the money.By 1962 the NASA Program for sending someone to the moon was launched and the public generally familiar with it. I can't believe that even the Disney Studios could have worked within the parameters that were known to the public, even for this innocuous comedy.Tom Tryon before Otto Preminger tried to make him a major star in The Cardinal was a Disney contract player and best known for the Texas John Slaughter films on television. Instead of going through the exacting selection process to be an astronaut, Tryon gets to be the first man to go to the Moon because the chimpanzee who had made the trip previously had stuck a fork in him, causing him to jump and make General Brian Keith think he volunteered.But that isn't all for our intrepid astronaut, this mysterious woman with a French accent played by Dany Saval keeps trying to contact him to make sure a special coat of paint is used on the space ship. Otherwise Tryon will exhibit the same behavior as the chimpanzee. And that wouldn't be good because Saval's getting a thing for him.Saval's not an American, but she isn't French either. She's from a faraway planet called Beta Lyrae and Tryon's attempts to at first shake her involve the Air Force as personified by Keith and the Federal Security Agency as typified by Edmond O'Brien. Due to reasons of national security these two keep working at cross purposes and of course neither are solving anything.I have to hand it to Keith and O'Brien. Both these veterans realized this film was a turkey and then they proceeded to enjoy it the best they could with one of the great blustering contests of all time. You have to be your own judge to determine which one you think is overacting more. Please note that the euphemism Federal Security Agency was used for the FBI. No one, least of all at Disney Studio was going to make fun of them in 1962.Moon Pilot was one of the least successful of Disney films, it certainly hasn't aged well. All of the cast did better things, even at the Magic Kingdom."
230,tt0310778,7,"It's wartime drama - WWII, with French and Jews and Germans, but this one is somehow fun, earnestly so. Director Jean-Paul Rappeneau co-wrote the script to his well-received film ""Bon Voyage"" (2003). Unlike director Bertrand Tavernier's ""Safe Conduct"" aka ""Laissez-passer"" (2002), w-d Rolf Schubel's ""Gloomy Sunday"" (1999), or w-d Claude Berri's ""Lucie Aubrac"" (1997), ""Bon Voyage"" is as chipper as its title sounds - c'est la vie (whatever) - and we have the beautiful talented Isabelle Adjani to thank for. It is her delightful performance throughout as the center of attraction (and attention), the cause and effect of it all, that made the film so enjoyable as it is. Hell, what's another derailment of her plan and expectations - will worry about that another time. The backbone of the story does revolve around a pair of young enthusiasts: Grégori Derangère as Frédéric and Virginie Ledoyen (from Francois Ozon's ""8 Women"") as Camille. The incomparable Gérard Depardieu, the witty Yvan Attal (of ""My Wife is An Actress"") and versatile Peter Coyote (juggling French, English and German here) are some of the stellar cast involved. There are many characters coming and going in this plot of a movie, and how it's all juggled is a skilful knack that requires no analysis - Rappeneau is simply a genius. The story just builds upon itself, one episode after another, or even with overlapping events, but never confusing - that's the delight of it all, somehow every detail turns out right on the screen and we just lap it all up like a tastily presented French dessert, literally so. There's thrills, trills, tender hesitant moments and taut ominous escapes, all playing out in front of our eyes.  From reading the Director's Note on the Sony Pictures Classics' Bon Voyage official site, Rappeneau indicated this is his most personal and successful work ever. Depicting Bordeaux 1940 from memories of his childhood years is very much close to his heart and he ""had worked and reworked the script for almost 3 years."" This film is a labor of love all round, the cast and crew complementing the director's passion and a formidable script by collaborative writers along with the director and his son Julien - adaptation efforts by Gilles Marchand, Patrick Modiano, and Jérôme Tonnerre.Music by Gabriel Yared (varied in tone from his previous film scores like ""The English Patient"" or ""Talented Mr. Ripley""), who provided a befitting theme that kept the pace and rhythm of the plot going - almost like a train going non-stop, reflecting Adjani's Viviane's vivacious energy (even when she's tired), keeping her going as she meets whatever comes, walking on with head held high and stylish attire always, no looking back, let alone time for regrets. Ah, mustn't forget the wonderfully translated, skilful subtitles by Ian Burley, who also did subtitles for films in Italian: ""Bread and Tulips"" (2000) aka Pane e tulipani, ""The Last Kiss"" (2001) aka L'ultimo bacio, and Tom Tykwer's ""Heaven"" (2002).If you find this much too light a wartime relationship drama, try w-d Mäx Fäberböck's ""Aimée and Jaguar"" (1999, in German, based on a true story) with brilliant performances from Juliane Köhler as Aimée and Maria Schrader as Jaguar."
231,tt0310778,9,"This movie travels farther on 8 gunshots, 2 kisses and 100 clichés than should be possible. Yet it still works. Brilliant.As I was driving home from the theater, I tried to figure out how it got away with movie staples like the pages of a novel manuscript blowing across a beach or the impossible series of fortuitous coincidences without the entire audience standing up and screaming, ""I've seen that a million times before! And you've pushed beyond the edge of believability!"" But the actors were so enchanting and the screen so filled with believable extras that I forgot to care. A friend who saw it with me said it transported him to Paris so perfectly that he was disappointed when we left the theater and realized we were still in Indiana.Overall, a romantic-comedy-thriller with subtlety, wit and elan."
232,tt0310778,9,"Director and auteur Jean-Pierre Rappenau was 8 years old during the spring of 1940 as France's Third Republic disintegrated in a matter of a few weeks. It was a time, he says, when ""all the adults were a little bit insane."" He and the production staff have lovingly and meticulously recreated that world in a film where all the characters are essentially fictional. The structure, a classic farce, is ideal for the period as multiple plot lines zip and intersect only to come together in a logical, satisfying conclusion. The peg for this plot is Frederic, played by brilliant newcomer Gregory Derangere, who is fully up to playing opposite Adjani, Depardieu and Ledoyen. The real strength of the film is in its supporting performances. M. Rappeneau has cast the film exquisitely with actors who volunteered ideas for both action and dialogue and who know and prove that it is possible to fully realize a character with just two short sentences of dialogue. Though not yet as widely influential as Renoir's 'Rules of the Game,' 'Bon Voyage' richly deserves to be a companion piece to that classic. Though it demands a lot of the audience, it gives much back. One of its demands is tolerance for a certain coyness and misdirection as to the exact genre we are watching: a crime melodrama, no, a spy thriller, ah, a romantic comedy. Recommend it to cinemaphile friends. Just be sure to let them discover for themselves that it is a romantic comedy."
234,tt0310778,9,"In Paris, a few months before the Nazi invasion, the manipulative actress Viviane Denvers (Isabelle Adjani) uses her former sweetheart Frédéric Auger (Grégori Deràngere) to hide the body of a man killed by her. Frédéric hits the car, the dead man is found and he is sent to prison. When the Germans invade France, Frédéric escapes with another prisoner, Raoul (Yvan Attal), and they become friends. In the runaway to Bordeaux, they meet in the train Camille (Virginie Ledoyen), the young assistant of the physicist Professeur Kopolski (Jean-Marc Stehlé), who is trying to leave France with his research of heavy water. Once in Bordeaux, the group meets Viviane with her new lover, the minister of state Jean-Étienne Beaufort (Gérard Depardieu), and is chased by a German spy, the journalist Alex Winckler (Peter Coyote), while Paris is falling and the population is confused. What a delightful and magnificent romantic adventure ""Bon Voyage"" is! The excellent and complex screenplay has action, romance, war, comedy, espionage, drama and lots of characters, played by a fantastic cast, indeed a constellation of stars; the direction is stunning; the music score is wonderful. I really loved this marvelous film, and I have to finish my review due to my limitation of adjectives to describe such a gem. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Viagem do Coração"" (""Travel of the Heart"")"
235,tt0310778,1,"When I went to see Bon Voyage, I expected a good, skillful multidrama on the order of Grand Hotel (1932) and Les Enfants de Paradis (1944). It was better than that. With few exceptions, none of the characters were totally good or totally evil--just as in real life. The acting was wonderful, especially those who played Frédéric, Raoul, and Camille. The photography was amazing, as it recreated the period perfectly and managed to be shot in/around Bordeaux during a time of new public works but managed the ""look"" of June 1940. Costumes and make-up were accurate. There is so much in this movie that it's worth a second viewing. It's exciting, funny, and, ultimately, touching. N.B.--Be sure to see it in a theatre with good quality projection. It's in wide-screen, and in the theater where I saw it (the Clairmont in Montclair) the first 30 minutes had the subtitles at the bottom in focus but the actors' faces slightly fuzzy! This was ultimately corrected but detracted from the pleasure of the film."
236,tt0080437,8,"Some movies are like buried treasure; someone manages to slip them into the theater, practically under every critic's nose, where they either thrive or famish and then vanish into the nearest video catalog. ""The Big Red One"" is one of those films. For all the hoopla created by ""Saving Private Ryan"" (another excellent film, which, in my opinion, had a better understanding of it's subject than a lot of it's critics gave it credit for), it owed a great deal to what Sam Fuller did a decade and a half before.Lee Marvin, an actual WWII veteran himself, holds the film together as the tough but exhausted seargent. When he tells Mark Hamill (yes, Luke Skywalker, folks) that you don't murder animals, you kill them, the look on his face after that seems to say that he wished it could be some other way. It's hard to grab defining moments in this film as stand-out, but the two sequences that stick the most to my mind are the taking of the insane asylum and the horrors of the concentration camp. While other movies have focused on specific campaigns, ""The Big Red One"" deserves high marks for painting the broad canvass of the Second World War from the perspective of the guys who actually had to do the work."
237,tt0055740,1,"This movie should have much exposure than it did. I can't really add much more to the existing comments.It's a marvelous family movie, and especially heartwarming for any boy who has any musical talent - singing or playing - to watch.Why Disney hasn't put this and some of their other timeless classics onto restored DVD's, I have no idea. I'd be waiting in line to buy this one if it were available.So if any of you greedy format-inventing Disney dorks are reading, get some of the old stuff out and remaster it. You'll be even richer than you already are!"
238,tt0055740,1,"This is an excellent movie, especially for those who enjoy listening to The Vienna Boys Choir. There is nothing better, as far as I am concerned, than listening to the soprano voices of a Boy's Choir. I myself, was once a choir boy, and enjoyed the many years that I sang in three different boys choirs. To this day, I still sing in a choir. Back to my report on this movie. This Disney movie utilizes the world renowned Vienna Boy's Choir, as the bases for its plot. The movie itself, is not a best seller, but the singing throughout the movie is beautiful. I find myself rewinding the film and playing the songs over and over. The star of the movie is a young boy Tony Fiala, played by Vincent Winter, who wants to become a member of the choir. When his parents finally agree, he goes, but is put on probation. One of the Choirmasters feels that Tony is blessed with an exceptional voice. This does not go over very well with one of the senior boys, Peter Schaefer, played by Sean Scully. I don't want to spoil this movie for you, so you will have to see it to see how this all works out. In another comment, which you can read on this site, it was mentioned that, and I quote: "" there's a scene wherein several of the boys are required to dress as girls for a public performance!"" In reading this statement, I feel that there are some overtones, that are not being said out loud. If the person who wrote this, (comment on the movie), had ever gone to a performance of the Vienna Boys Choir, he would've probably seen the boys (himself) dress up as girls. In each of the shows I saw, the boys had to dress as girls, so as to perform the small musical that they put on. It was always and accepted part of the performance, and we, the audience, never thought anything different. To me, I don't think it ever harmed any of those boys. In fact,I myself on one occasion, on a Halloween night in the fifties, got dressed up as the mayor of our city. I won first prize in our school function for my effort. I always thought that was so cool. Today, people are not as relaxed about these sort of situations, which is too bad.This movie is an excellent movie that the whole family can watch. If you are able to get a copy, do so. They are hard to find. I was able to obtain a copy of it on ""e-bay"" and paid dearly for it. I have not regretted it one bit. I have also written to Disney to see whether they have any intention of making it into a DVD in the near future. The reply was not favourable at this time, but maybe in the future. I sure hope so. There are a lot of movies out there today that are not half as good as this film is, and they are already on DVD. So, I'm praying for a turnaround at the Disney Studios."
239,tt0056173,1,"Ernest Thompson Seton's story has been brought to the screen in a remarkable and unique way.  There is no dialogue in the whole movie.  The story is told through narration by Rex Allen (who had the perfect voice for this sort of thing) and music performed by the Sons of the Pioneers.  (The title song, which reappears throughout the film, was written by the Sherman Brothers.) Oliver Wallace provides a nice music score and the outdoor photography by Jack Couffer and Lloyd Beebe is beautiful.  All of these elements combine to form a very entertaining film.  May the legend live on."
240,tt0056173,1,"Being the big fan of wolves that I am, finding a copy of ""Legend of Lobo"" on VHS a few years back at the local Musicworld was a real treat for me.This movie is one of my all-time favorites; I just cannot give it enough praise. For once, the wolves are portrayed the way they should be. They are neither sugarcoated nor villified, but rather are shown to be both a efficient predator and a devoted parent in times of encroaching human settlement. The scenery is excellent, as is the storyline which is not too complicated for young ones to follow. I love the theme song catchy and the characters are believable. About the only thing I can say negative about this movie is the extensive use of canned sounds, especially for the wolves, but this really does not detract from the rest of the film. Legend of Lobo is a beautifully made movie that I would recommend to anyone!"
241,tt0056173,9,"I'm a little biased; the writer (Dwight Hauser) is my wife's father. We were looking for a copy and came across this site. It was fun for me to watch Marcia (my wife) watch the movie. And as with many thousands of other old folks, I remember it from my own childhood.I wonder if Lobo's mother was really injured. It certainly looked like it. I asked Marcia, but she didn't know. It seems doubtful Disney would have gone about it that way. Kinda heart wrenching, but an accurate reflection of the disdain held for wolves in those days...heck...even these days by a remaining few.This is a great find! We are passing it out to all the grandkids...:-)Derek"
242,tt0056173,3,"During his lifetime, producer Walt Disney did turn out some interesting animal-themed shorts and movies. However, ""The Legend of Lobo"" is one time where Disney was apparently unable to give sufficient inspiration to his filmmakers. There are a number of things I could list that illustrate why this effort is a misfire, such as the obvious padding even for a 67 minute running time, the too-cutesy narration, and an ending that is abrupt and without a satisfying payoff. But I think that the main fault with the movie is that the wolf Lobo never becomes a strong animal figure. Yes, the first half follows him around when he is a pup, but he is then an immature animal that lacks any soul. It's even worse when Lobo becomes a full grown adult wolf - you never get a sense of any kind of personality you can relate to or understand. By the way, no director is listed in the credits for the movie - if the director decided to take his name off the credits after seeing the end results, I can certainly understand his decision."
243,tt0056173,5,"Not enough there for a good film.'The Legend of Lobo' features some cute animals and interesting situations, but with its 67 minute run time and lack of any substantial characters it's hard to get into it in film terms; like 'Nikki, Wild Dog of the North', it is too close to a documentary; though, to be fair, this is better than that.The usual animal welfare concerns appear, but it does seem improved; at least compared to the aforementioned production from 1961. Rex Allen makes for a satisfactory narrator, at least. The music is decent, too.As noted, there are adorable shots of animals but there simply isn't enough to make it a film worth watching in my eyes."
244,tt0056173,6,"Another in a long line of enjoyable Disney nature films. This one tells the story of a wolf named Lobo (not Sherriff Lobo) from when he's a young pup to when he becomes an adult with a large bounty on his head. There's all sorts of corny cuteness with Lobo playing other animals and such, but the film was surprisingly realistic in the human hunters attempts to kill or capture Lobo with some pretty scary traps and hunting dogs. However, this remains a Disney films and is hardly a grim diatribe about the evils of hunting. At it's heart it's about cute animals and an appreciation for nature, which all goes down quite easy and without much pretension."
245,tt0056173,6,"It's a Disney True-Life adventure shot near Sedonia, Arizona, with the cast and crew that was becoming standard for the series of pseudo-documentaries, with James Algar directing and Rex Bell narrating, with songs by the Sherman twins and incidental music by the Sons of the Pioneers.It's the story of Lobo, a wolf in the 19th Century, about the time cattle ranching was introduced following the wiping out of the buffalo, based on a story by Ernst Thompson Seton. There's the usual amazing photography, not just of the red butte-and-mesa land, but the amazingly trained animals.Enjoyable as the parts of the movie are, I noticed that the story-telling aspect had fallen into set patterns. When the young Lobo makes friends and goes frolicking with a young antelope, it struck me: in many ways, this movie is BAMBI, only Man has entered the desert, with guns and traps and dogs. There's clearly a character, an uncredited actor who has set himself against Lobo, but he is given no personality; he is referred to only as ""the hunter.""Disney was by no means a one-man operation; there were many creative people working for him. However, his management-by-wandering-around style meant that, although he might have one project at a time uppermost in his mind -- at this point, probably MARY POPPINS -- he might turn up at any point. The folks in the animation section had a warning for when was was around: ""Man is in the Forest."""

270,tt0057579,7,"Superb, sentimental live-action drama from Walt Disney concerns a young Scottish girl's love and devotion to her sickly pet cat, who gets a new lease on life from a ""magical"" mountain woman whom the townspeople believe is a witch. The screenplay, from Paul Gallico's book, tries packing too much plot into its 100 minutes and, as a result, the midsection of the movie doesn't feel fully played-out. Still, the majority of the film is captivating, beautifully shot, and the characters are engaging and believable. Karen Dotrice (best known as Jane from ""Mary Poppins"") is quite the little thespian here, and her tears and youthful anger are convincing; she's as good a child actress as I have ever seen (Walt must've had a soft spot for wholesome British lasses, Dotrice and Hayley Mills seem sprung from the same boarding school). The production is plush and Thomasina is one gorgeous feline. *** from ****"
248,tt0057518,7,"By the time Son of Flubber was released by Walt Disney in 1963, Fred MacMurray was firmly established in the third phase of his career as star of G-rated Disney films and television situation comedies. MacMurray was able to do this because of a unique clause he had written into his contract with CBS which produced the My Three Sons show that he starred in for a dozen or so years. All of MacMurray's scenes in all episodes were filmed at the beginning of the cycle so as to allow him to do those Disney films as well. It worked out great for him.Disney took virtually the entire cast of The Absent Minded Professor and added several new faces as well. In the previous film, MacMurray revolutionizes rubber by making a substance that bounces higher with each bounce than lower. That film ends with MacMurray flying to Washington in his Model T (you read it right) to give flubber for the defense of the free world.But Washington, DC red tape being what it is MacMurray and his new bride Nancy Olson aren't seeing any money any time soon. But not to worry, Fred's found a byproduct of flubber that he calls flubber gas. A lighter than air substance that really makes anything fly.In the first film, MacMurray used his college's basketball team as a test for flubber. In Son of Flubber, flubber gas is tested during a football game with the same hilarious results. In fact more so because in this film Paul Lynde is the stressed and harried play by play announcer of the college football game. For me he's the highlight of the film.In Son of Flubber, Disney gives us an entertaining and worthy successor to the Absent Minded Professor that after almost fifty years will still appeal to anyone not made of stone."
249,tt0057518,6,"There is no disguising that this is an obvious attempt on Disney to cash in on the success of ""The Absent Minded Professor"" made 2 years earlier. No one can fault them for that - however, there seems to be little originality in this version. You would think they would have made a greater attempt at new gags and originality. Unfortunately, that is not the case.There is the same sports scene set-up. In AMP it was a basketball game. In SOF it is a football game. There is the same romantic rivalry between Brainard (Fred McMurray) and Professor Shelby Ashton (Elliott Reid), over Brainard's wife, Betsy (Nancy Olsen). They do throw in a 4th party in this film for good measure -Desiree de la Roche (Joanna Cook Moore) - as Brainard's old flame who has her sights set on him again. There is another prank on Professor Shelby while he is driving in his car (this time its filling with water from a Brainard created rain cloud inside the car). You still have Alonzo Hawks (Kennan Wynn) trying to destroy Medfield College by calling in their overdue loan. You have the same cops from the prior moving getting their new squad car destroyed again. So as you see, not a lot of originality here.The worst scene in my opinion is the ending of the court room scene. The giant fruit and the marching band were way over the top. I did like the stunts on the football field, however. Some of the jumping and flying ball players looked very realistic. I also liked the closing shot of the satellites, the flying football, and earth in the background. Pretty good special effects.It is interesting that McMurray was an accomplished saxophone player, so look for him playing the actual music during the Halloween party. Also, Paul Lynde makes his film debut in this movie. I liked seeing William Demarest (later to be Uncle Charley on ""My Three Sons"") in a small role that matches him up with McMurray. He doesn't begin ""MTS"" until 1965 which is 2 years after this film. Also, you may remember Joanna Cook Moore as the actress that played Andy's girlfriend Peg on ""The Andy Griffith Show"" for 4 episodes in 1962. Perhaps it helped her land this role. She has another claim to fame - she married Ryan O'Neal in 1963 and is the mother of Tatum O'Neal.Overall, this sequel doesn't play quite as well as the first. It is still entertaining in places and has a host of noteworthy supporting players."
250,tt0057518,6,"I first saw 1997's ""Flubber"", starring Robin Williams, not long after it was released on video, and never knew it was a remake at the time, but found that out around the time I watched the movie again many years later. That was how I later got around to watching the original 1961 film, ""The AbsentMinded Professor"", starring Fred MacMurray. It's been nearly a year and a half since I watched that film, but I still remember thinking it was better than the lacklustre remake. ""Son of Flubber"" is the 1963 sequel to the 1961 live action Disney movie, so I was bound to end up watching it eventually. As with most sequels, I was expecting this one to be downhill from the original, and I think it is (just slightly), but it's definitely still better than the 1997 movie.Professor Ned Brainard has introduced his invention of Flubber to the U.S. military, but when he goes to get paid for his amazing invention, he learns that the Pentagon has decided that the substance must be kept top secret, and they can't give the professor his payment for it yet. This doesn't help the fact that the future of Medfield College is once again in jeopardy due to financial problems, and that Ned and his wife, Betsy are broke and get a huge tax bill. However, the absent-minded physical chemistry professor has a new discovery which he hasn't unleashed upon the world yet. It's called Flubber gas, and it can change the weather! He believes this new gas can end his current troubles, and Biff Hawk plans to use it to help the college football team win a game. However, as Ned experiments with this Flubber gas, he ends up causing trouble which he is unaware of, and he also finds that his marriage is in trouble.This sequel didn't seem that interesting to me at first when I got around to watching it, but that soon changed. As a comedy, ""Son of Flubber"" certainly isn't hilarious, but the gags are often funny, even if there are no huge laughs. Memorable ones include the scenes with a certain Medfield College football player's uniform filled with Flubber gas, Ned making it rain inside with his new invisible substance and the way the dog reacts to it, and the professor not realizing that the Flubber gas is making glass shatter all over town, with people not knowing how it's happening! However, there also may be times when it gets a little too silly, and I wouldn't say most of the film is really that funny. Still, at least I can say I laughed at times, definitely more often than I did when I last watched ""Flubber"", the 1997 film. Aside from the humour, the story isn't exactly great, but it was enough to hold my interest, at least somewhat, though it did seem a tad overlong to me. I also think the cast is mostly good here, including Fred MacMurray.Since I waited quite a while to watch this sequel after watching ""The AbsentMinded Professor"" early last year, they're not as easy for me to compare as they would be if I had watched one just after the other. However, I clearly remember that I wasn't amazed by the 1961 Disney film, but still thought it was pretty good family fare, and unsurprisingly a case where the original is superior to the remake. This 1963 sequel isn't as popular as its predecessor, and even though I watched it a while after the original, I guess I can understand that, but it does come close in quality. Neither is an absolute classic (many animated Disney films that Walt Disney was around to produce are superior to these two live action ones made only several years before his death), but they still have their charm decades after they were originally released in the early 60's, even if this one was more of a cash-in and didn't have much new to offer after the original."
251,tt0057518,7,"this sequel to The Absent Minded Professor is actually a better movie.i found it funnier,more entertaining and it had a better story.the character were expanded a bit more,which makes sense,since it is a sequel.unlike Professor,this one doesn't have any slow or boring moments.it's much better paced.i like the fact that the wife had more to do in this one.the movie is just as silly,but it's meant to be,and if you keep that in mind going in,you'll probably enjoy it more.it's not high art or anything,but it will keep you entertained for 102 minutes or so.and it's fun for the whole family.my vote for The Son of Flubber:6.5/10"
252,tt0057518,1,"I love This Movie I don't take it too seriously. I just think it is great fun! I think it is just as good as absent minded professor in it's own way. .Flubber becomes a victim of ""national security"" and our hero Ned Brainerd (MacMurray) returns home empty handed from our nation's capital to find creditors threatening to cancel his newspaper subscription, predators threatening to bulldoze Medfield College, the IRS threatening to ruin his life, and his wife (Nancy Olsen) looking like a million bucks in her new mink coat while holding a check for same for something poor Ned doesn't own anymore and can't sell so that we can all enjoy the wonders of Flubberoleum and can safely drop our children on the floor without the fear of being locked up by Social Services. A very frustrating start to the terrific sequel to Absent Minded Professor, all adding to the friction of MacMurray, who must now invent something entirely new so that he can save Medfield, his home, and his marriage from the slimy advances of Prof. Shelby Ashton (Elliot Reid) and the return of luscious old flame Desiree DE la Roche (Joanna Moore).All the usual suspects are here from Disney's vast arsenal of character actors to keep us entertained while Ned goes about inventing a weather making glass breaking food growing machine. The Halloween chase scene with Prof. Brainerd terrorizing Shelby Ashton from above with his new rainmaking device is one of the funniest in Disney history. And of course we're treated to another Medfield sports showdown vs. national champs Rutland in a gridiron match up where Flubber becomes the great equalizer. Paul Lynde is absolutely hilarious as the football announcer"
253,tt0057518,5,"Proving that the Disney studios didn't become cash-mongers solely in the Michael Eisner era, this sequel to 1961's ""The Absent Minded Professor"" is nothing more than repackaged goods. Lamebrained slapstick has Fred MacMurray returning to role of small town inventor who attempts to save the local high school from ruin. There are a few funny digs at the advertising business but, as with the original, MacMurray's romance problems and his run-ins with the law are dull. Terrific supporting cast (Jack Albertson, Joanna Moore, Paul Lynde, William Demarest) looks like a who's-who of suburban comedies, and the movie is fairly easy to sit through if you don't mind completely innocuous fare, but even the special effects are mechanical. ** from ****"
254,tt0057312,7,"Miracle of the White Stallions is a story set in the final days of World War II in Europe. Robert Taylor plays an Austrian Colonel in the German army. Back in his civilian days he was the head of the famous Spanish Riding School in Vienna which featured the famous Lippazaner breed of specially trained horses. The school had been operating in Vienna for four hundred years and its future in doubt with both the American and Russian armies closing in and the Lippazaner mares over in Czechoslovakia. The performances of these horses had entertained Viennese natives and visitors for generations and they were and are considered a national treasure. The film concerns Robert Taylor's efforts to save the horses aided of course by Lilli Palmer playing his wife.The criticism of this film is that Taylor's performance is too wooden. But I think the point is missed that he was a single minded man on a mission and apparently flunked out of diplomacy school. Fortunately he's married to Lilli Palmer who smooths a lot of rough edges out during the film. I think that's what was intended in this script.As the German surrender and Taylor fortunately falls into the hands of the Americans instead of the Russians, he manages to interest an American major played by James Franciscus in his quest. Who then in turn interests the theater commander who is George S. Patton.As we learned in the movie Patton, George was an old horse cavalry man and even rode in the 1912 Olympics for the United States. Good thing he was in charge instead of Montgomery. Patton is nicely played by character actor John Larch.Others in the cast of this very nice family film are Eddie Albert as Taylor's aide and Curt Jurgens as a weary German general who helps Taylor in his hour of need.Nice piece of family entertainment from the Walt Disney studio."

255,tt0057473,5,"I saw this movie within the last few years and sadly is one of those films, that while not the worst I have seen...just didn't click with me. Yes, ""Savage Sam"" had a tough act to follow, and one has to keep in mind that it should be watched with the understanding that it was not intended to be another ""Old Yeller"". But due to several factors, in my opinion, this movie could have been a lot better.*There is confusion as to how Sam is related to Old Yeller. Is he supposed to be the now grown dog seen in the original ""Old Yeller"" as a puppy? Or did Yeller stud another female around the same time resulting in the dog seen in ""Savage Sam""? Or was the spotted dog seen in ""Savage Sam"" a litter mate to the yellow pup seen in O.Y?*The acting, in my opinion seems lackluster. While Tommy Kirk and Kevin Corcoran displayed amazing chemistry in ""Old Yeller"" and many of the other films they starred in together...they seemed to be ""going through the motions"" in this picture. *The story pacing was a bit choppy...often boring. Fred Gipson's book of the same title provides some background and imagery, helping to keep the story moving along. Seems to be missing here.*Finally, yes there were settler/Indian battles from that time era, but Disney did indeed paint Native Americans in an excessively evil light. Could have been handled better...this is where background and history of the conflict could have been developed a bit better.All in all, this movie is not unwatchable...but due to flaws which I have described, I think the movie is weak...despite me keeping in mind that ""Savage Sam"" is no ""Old Yeller""."
256,tt0057473,7,"We all know that ""Old Yeller"" is a classic. It will always stand out as one of the best live-action Disney films of its time. With that said, does any kind of follow-up film deserve any attention? ""Savage Sam"" certainly does. It is another well made Disney adventure. Classic? Almost, but ""Old Yeller"" was a tough act to follow.I found ""Savage Sam"" refreshing because it made no attempt to be anything like ""Yeller"". Sam the dog is not a threat to anyone. In this movie, he is also not the center of attention. This story is different; Travis and Arliss are older. That's how it should be. Six years passed between the release of the movies.Brian Keith was great in this film. Here, he is supposed to be the younger brother of Fess Parker's character in ""Yeller"". I really liked him here.As another DVD in my Disney collection, everyone in the family enjoyed it. I give it *** out of four stars."
257,tt0057542,7,"The decade that brought us the First World War may seem an odd subject for nostalgia, but ""Summer Magic"", like ""On Moonlight Bay"" from a few years earlier, is a film which tries to persuade us that, whatever may have been happening on the battlefields of Europe, the 1910s (or the ""Ragtime Era"" as many Americans called them) really were the time of a kinder, gentler America. (It is, apparently, a remake of a 1938 film called ""Mother Carey's Chickens"", which I have never seen). Margaret Carey, a recently widowed mother from Boston, is forced to move out of the family home when she discovers that her late husband was the victim of a fraudulent investment scheme. She and her three children, Nancy, Gilly and Peter, relocate to the small town of Beulah, Maine, where they rent a large yellow house. (Gilly- pronounced with a hard ""G""- is a boy, not a girl. The name is presumably short for Gilbert, but this is never actually made clear). There are two main plot lines. The first revolves around the family's friendship with Ossian (""Osh"") Popham, the agent for their rather mysterious landlord Mr Hamilton. The kindly Osh is more than just a letting agent; he is also the town's storekeeper and general odd-job- man. The second plot line deals with the visit of the Careys' spoilt, snobbish cousin Julia and the mutual dislike which grows up between her and Nancy, especially when they fall for the same man. This was the fourth of six films which Hayley Mills made for Walt Disney Productions. Hayley was, of course, originally from England, but during this period of her career was most often cast (as here) as an American, even though she had trouble managing a convincing American accent. (Here she attempts to sound more American by shortening the long ""a"" vowels, but this only makes her sound closer to Boston, Lincolnshire than to Boston, Massachusetts). This did not, however, affect her popularity, and she became possibly the most popular teenage star of the sixties. In Britain she tended to be cast in more serious roles (""Tiger Bay"", ""Whistle Down the Wind"", ""The Chalk Garden""), but most of her American films were comedies, of which this is a good example. It is also a good example of just what made Hayley so popular in her day- her wonderful liveliness and vivaciousness, combined with a gift for conveying sweetness and innocence. By 1963, when she would have been seventeen, she performed a sort of dual role for Disney. To the older generation she was the daughter they wished they had. To boys, she was the girlfriend they wished they had, a sex symbol in the nicest possible way. Dorothy McGuire, looking much younger than her 47 years, is good as Margaret, as is Deborah Walley as the insufferable Julia. The other performance which stands out, however, is from Burl Ives as the warm- hearted, if occasionally devious, Osh. Ives had originally made his name as a folk-singer, but later became a successful actor, both on Broadway and in the cinema. I had previously associated him with serious dramas such as ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"" and ""The Big Country"", but here he shows that he could do light comedy as well. The film is also a musical with several songs, although none of them rally stand out apart from ""The Ugly Bug Ball"", which was a favourite of mine as a child. (I had no idea at the time that it was from a film). The plot at times becomes a bit hard to follow, especially the various machinations involving Osh and Mr Hamilton, and the ending seems a bit too abrupt. Overall, however, the film's cheerful atmosphere and the contributions of Mills and Ives make this a watchable example of warm- hearted Disney family entertainment. 7/10"
258,tt0057546,7,"The 90 minute cartoon is in fact the first chapter of T.H. White's novel The Once and Future King. Made for the kids, Disney does it again taking a classic story and adding fictional animal characters that can talk. Still, Disney remains loyal to the story by keeping many of the characters in the story including Kay, Sr. Pellinoire, and Sir Ector.Worth watching twice with the family. An animated classic"
259,tt0057546,9,"The Sword and the Stone is a very relaxing movie to watch. In an animation, you want humour and emotion, and this movie had plenty of both. Most of the humour comes from Sir Ektor(voice of Sebastian Cabot) and Archimedes (voice of Junius Matthews), but Merlin (voice of Karl Swenson) had some truly delicious lines. I just love Archimedes, he is absolutely hilarious, and still manages to be likable, despite being very grumpy. The animation was lovely, and the scenes when Wart (voice of Ricky Sorenson)was an animal were truly entertaining. My personal favourite was the squirrel scene, but the duel of Merlin and Mim was the highlight of the film for me. The songs by the Sherman Brothers, while not particularly memorable, were very pleasant to listen to, as was the incidental music by the composer of the Jungle Book George Bruns. All in all, a truly enjoyable movie, that is definitely underrated. 9/10 from me. Bethany Cox"
260,tt0057546,7,"This movie is another proof of the high quality of the classic Disney films. Today feature films are quite funny too... but they based mostly on simple, crude jokes and spoofing of other topical movies (remember the bullet time-spoof in ""Shrek""). There is no substance to think about in it. You can see them, laughing about them...and forgot them almost completely a few years later. Who will remember, i.e., ""Ice Age"" or ""Madagascar"" in 40, 50 or 60 years? The old Disney classics are different, there are timeless! ""The Sword in the Stone"" contains a lot of joyful gags too, but no gag stands above the characters, no joke was made only to fill a hole in the plot. The story, the plot, and the characters are primary. And Disney add not only joyful gags. As Walt himself once said: ""For every laugh, there should be a tear."" Disney take children always quite seriously, and a lot of his early films contains a lesson for life, sometimes the lesson can be very sad and cruel, like in ""Bambi"", sometimes lesser sad, like in ""The Sword in the Stone""... but can anybody forget the cute little girl squirrel, that was left by Wart, desperately crying and with a broken heart? And Merlin's closing words about love: ""Well, yes, in its own way... yes, I'd say it's the most powerful force on Earth""!This is one of the main ingredient of the famous Disney Magic: Joy and tragedy! Another is the art of hand drawn animation. The quality of the animation went downwards at Disney after WW-II too, slowly, but surely. But in 1963 cel-animation was still on a high level. Not so good as in the golden Era, when ""Fantasia"", ""Pinocchio"" or especially ""Bambi"" set the utmost high standards of perfectionism, but quite better than in ""Hercules"", ""The Lion King"" or ""The Rescuers down under"". 7 of 10 stars for ""The Sword in the Stone""! It is not the best of all Disney films, but quite better and deeper than the most of the modern CGI movies!"
261,tt0058355,7,"Sleepy, over-the-hill ""teenager"" Tommy Kirk isn't really the ideal actor to carry a movie set on a mythical college campus, one wherein everyone is relentlessly energetic and colorful. Kirk is supposed to be wacky and wonderful too, but he's the most normal of the bunch, bland and grounded. Still, there are some chuckles in this Walt Disney production about a nerdy college whiz, and love-interest Annette Funicello is lively doing the same love-means-a-wedding-ring thing she perfected in the concurrent ""Beach Party"" flicks. Much preferable to its immediate sequel, ""The Monkey's Uncle"", which--despite an opening featuring Annette on stage with The Beach Boys!--just didn't have the heart or spirit of this one. *** from ****"
262,tt0058355,7,"The movie seems to have dramatic arcs that end at 45 minutes. First 45 minutes is about mind reading. The second 45 minutes was about hypnotism. Both almost seemed disconnected from each other. If there is anyone out there who knows about the production or about this T.V. show....Uh.. oops..I mean movie, let me know. I guess I'll have to mention my guess for why this Potential television series did not happen. The scandal of Disney discovering that ""Tommy Kirk"" was not heterosexual, caused Disney to drop his contract. Since the series was already in the can, they had to do something with it. So to make some money back, they linked two of the four episodes into two feature films. Again if somebody out there has the real answer...write."
263,tt0058355,7,"This 1964 Disney film, like many other of it's era have been long forgotten except by certain aficionados such as myself. The Misadventures of Merlin Jones stars Tommy Kirk as the title character and the unforgettable Annette Funicello in the female lead.For those of you with short attention spans this movie actually wraps up one story line and continues to conclude another one...not only that, it's left open for a sequel called The Monkey's Uncle! Merlin Jones is the college campus genius who's wacky ""scientific"" experiments land him in more trouble than any good kid deserves. As a result of one experiment he gets his driver's license revoked, as a result of another he can suddenly read minds...including the mind of the judge that took his license away...and it seems that the good judge isn't all that good. Yet a 3rd experiment gets the judge himself into the same hot water that Merlin is usually in! Just as the title indicates this movie is one misadventure after another.Don't try to analyze this movie, just sit back and enjoy it. This is the kind of movie whose sole purpose is to celebrate life's little absurdities. If you enjoy being silly then you'll enjoy this Disney gem."
264,tt0058355,9,"If you're looking for something clean, family friendly and funny, here it is. The Misadventures of Merlin Jones delights from beginning to end. In this classic Disney fare, Tommy Kirk plays Merlin, an eccentric college student at Medfield college who is interested in science, in this case, hypnosis. Along the way, he and girlfriend Jennifer, payed by Annette Funicello, find themselves getting into all sorts of mischief. Included in the mischief is a chimp and a judge, who likes to write crime novels. Between the judge writing crime novels, a mischievous chimp and an eccentric student who uses hypnosis, what more in a plot could you expect or ask for? A great film for kids and adults alike that the whole family can enjoy."
265,tt0058355,4,"I kept waiting to hear that woman on the canned laughter used on ""Gilligan's Island"" saying ""Uh Oh!"" every time Tommy Kirk got into trouble. Having not seen one of Disney's generic comedies of the 60's or 70's in many years, I chose this one in an effort to go down memory lane and see why in my mind their grab bag of farcial entertainment seemed mediocre at best. Now I know the reason. These pleasant family films are basically TV sitcoms expanded for the big screen '60's and '70's style with child-like comedy distracting the viewer from realizing that they are virtually plot less.In the case of ""Merlin Jones"", I confirmed what I had suspected all along. Merlin is a geeky college kid who experiments in mind reading and hypnosis, constantly getting him into trouble. Annette Funnicello (away temporarily from the beach) is his harried girlfriend, while a slew of Hollywood veterans show up for the older crowd to appreciate. Leon Ames is the frazzled judge whom Merlin believes to be a closet criminal, while Stuart Erwin (who played his share of Merlin Jones type characters in the early 30's) is a befuddled police officer. The delightful Connie Gilchrist plays Ames' housekeeper, a reunion with him from their MGM days. For this, ""Merlin Jones"" is worth a look. There are a handful of genuine laughs to be had, but just be aware that they do not really involve a linear plot. The series of gags are part of a shell of a story. I dare not complete my review by failing to mention one of the worst movie theme songs I've ever heard in my life. It makes the same years' ""John Goldfarb, Please Come Home!"" should like ""Que Sera Sera""!"
266,tt0058355,8,"Tommy Kirk is the great comic actor that should have been and had he lived in a better world and more enlightened time he would have. He should be invited on an episode of The Big Bang Theory opposite Jim Parsons as the older Merlin Jones. In this film he is winning and charming and he does everything and more that he can with the material. He relates easily to his co star Annette who is just okay and bland, his other comic foils who are familiar faces from early and mid sixties TV. Mr. Kirk has the best way of reading the most stereotypical of lines and his expressive face is priceless. Furthermore he is good looking. And sexy. So in spite of the supposed nerdiness of his character it is easy to believe that Annette would want him. I just wonder why he doesn't want a girl sharper than her character. She is loyal but her prodding causes his life more complications. The mind reading sequences are funny, the hypnotizing of the cat is great(and great for kids) and his attempted voo doing of the judge of in court with Annette on the comb for musical accompaniment had me laughing aloud. Far from being over the hill, Mr Kirk should have been promoted and gone on to better films with substantive scripts for adults. This is no more goofy and no less satiric than ""The Thrill of It All"" of the same era with Doris Day, though that film is aimed for adults and this for kids. Even so, it is very watchable (still great for kids) and given its age holds up because of Mr. Kirk's talent as a comic actor."
267,tt0058355,7,"Merlin Jones was intended to be two episodes of Walt Disney's Sunday night hour long anthology series ""The Wonderful World of Color."" For some reason, they decided to release it theatrically instead. Disney produced some very good films for his TV series like the 3 part Scarecrow of Romney Marsh and the Gallagher Boy Reporter episodes which were very highly rated. Merlin Jones was a theatrical hit for some odd reason, though far less entertaining than aforementioned programs. One can never predict what the American public will buy but even at the time this was pedestrian entertainment. I realized that even at 10 years old when I saw it at my local movie house."
268,tt0057579,8,"If you're fond of the little fur-bearing parasites this is a movie you cannot watch without a large hankerchief. It's superior to the current family movies in a number of reasons; lovely color, the realism of a vet's life, delightful Scots Highlands locations, a fine dramatic structure bolstered by that underrated actor Patrick Macgoohan and by a pretty, startlingly black-eyed starlet named Susan Hampshire (the two represent science and faith, respectively, and they come together with an ease you wish these two opponents would share today). But the film is mostly about the tragedy of losing a cat, and the childish, unkillable hope that one day they'll return. The sequence of cat heaven, ruled by the Goddess Bast, is reminiscent of the best of Michael Powell, explicitly referencing Powell's A Matter of Life and Death. The excellent animation is done by the pioneer of the cartoon industry Ub Iweks. A family movie in the day when kids were tougher, it was memorably broadcast on Disney's Wonderful World of Color on TV. I Expect wracking sobs in the scene where a rain- soaked Thomasina comes to the window. Jeez, I'm tearing up right now, just thinking about it."
269,tt0057579,7,"Strange and exciting Disney drama that seems forgotten today.Very popular for about a month in 1965 in Australia, I saw this in its first release and remember it very well. Disney films of that period seemed to add particularly interesting adult themes into their films especially if they contained British kids. Like Pollyanna or The Moonspinners or Mary Poppins, this film is perfectly realized for children and has enough weight and wry humor for parents to feel the production works for many ages. I am surprised this film is so forgotten today and is almost completely unavailable. It is just as good as any of those mentioned above which are widely available."
271,tt0057579,1,"(Spoiler) I remember seeing this as a little girl and how it made me cry when Thomasina runs back through the rain and jumps back through the window to Mary.  I have had cats all of my life and this movie truly captures the love one has for their pet and the anguish one feels over the loss of it.It's a little distracting to watch this film and Mary Poppins too close together since the main two children are the same in both films, but they are also wonderfully cast ... particularly Karen Dotrice as Mary.  It's also interesting that the bulk of this tale is told through the eyes (and voice) of the cat.In essence, the story is all about overcoming the pain of loss and finding happiness again.  The father has lost his wife and has become hardened because of it; taking it out on his daughter by callously dismissing the feelings she has for her injured pet.  Once the cat ""dies"", the daughter shows her disdain for her father by ignoring him and acting as if he doesn't exist.  Into the mix, we get a ""witch"" who ends up enchanting the father and making him see that love is still possible -- not only with her, but also between him and his daughter.  He just has to open up to both of them. The end is very heartening which makes it sad that this movie is virtually unknown to the generation that didn't grow up with it.  I have a copy of it on laserdisc and (since it is out of print), have made VHS copies to give to friends with small children so they can enjoy it as much as I did.If you can find a copy, watch it!  Time hasn't lessened it's appeal."
272,tt0058371,7,"From Walt Disney, an overly-involved story of jewel thieves and a young girl swept away by intrigue while vacationing in Crete. I understand why some say the film is sluggish or dull; it does drag, and has one too many plots going on, not to mention far too many characters who may-or-may-not be what they seem. However, Hayley Mills is enchanting as intrepid Nikky Ferris. She gets her ire up, gets to be silly, trades quips with Pola Negri (looking regal). Also fabulous: the dizzying sequence where Mills escapes villainous Eli Wallach by jumping from a windmill (beautiful camera-work and direction). Not a taut Hitchcockian mystery, but a good attempt at one. Terrific Terry Gilkyson theme song, fine supporting work from Wallach, Joan Greenwood and young Peter McEnery, who gives Hayley her first screen kiss. *** from ****"
273,tt0058371,1,"This movie is one of my favorites from the 1960's and I watch it again every once in a while.  It's also one of my favorite Hayley Mills movies.  The locations are beautiful, interesting and different.  The story is a solid mystery with sympathetic characters, and Mills plays a feisty, strong young woman.  The production values are a bit wanting, however, especially during the windmill scenes.  There's delightful humor, also, especially in some unexpected sights.  And Pola Negri gives a fine performance.  I love this movie and recommend it for anyone who likes a good mystery or Hayley Mills or Crete."
274,tt0058371,7,"No classic, but very pleasing, old-fashioned, middlebrow entertainment of a kind we used to take for granted. A little comedy, a little romance, a lot of action, plenty of eye-filling locations, and, in particular, a trio of wonderful women. Hayley's charming in one of her first puppy-love roles; Joan Greenwood, of the delicious voice, is, as always, indispensable; and Pola Negri does some spirited scenery-chewing in a prominent cameo. They thoroughly outclass the men, including a hammy Eli Wallach and a pallid Peter McEnery.Nothing about it is exceptional, but everything about it is at least competent. The direction is a little obvious: Every time a Maguffin appears in the script, Neilson pulls in for a close-up. Perhaps that's a sop to help the kiddies follow the story, though, despite the Disney imprimatur, it's not really a little-kids' film. On the contrary, it's one of Disney's least cloying, and one of the most appealing for grownups."
275,tt0058371,7,"Based on Mary Stuart's novel, The Moon-Spinners is a nice and amusing adventure comedy. Constructed a little bit like an Hitchcock movie, where tension is building up slowly but surely and where many characters are not always what they seem to be, it is filled with memorable scenes (the escape from the windmill, for example) and good humor. Although she may not be as sparkling as in Pollyanna or The Parent Trap, Hayley Mills is nevertheless still the star of the show, both charming and endearing. Furthermore, as a beautiful grown up, she is portraying a modern heroin, not afraid to take charge of her own detective work. As the villain, Eli Wallach is also particularly brilliant. Eventually, the music and, especially, the title song by Terry Gilkyson are lively and enchanting."
276,tt0058371,7,"I guess the script wasn't top-notch... Okay, it wasn't, but there are plenty of other things to concentrate on here.  Pretty good performances from Eli Wallach as the villian, Hayley Mills and Peter McEnery as the detectives/romantic leads, and Irene Papas as the villian's nervous sister, who dosen't have much to do but makes an impression.  Also, funny comic performances from Joan Greenwood as Mills' aunt and the appearence of Pola Negri, the silent screen star, as the jewel collector Madame Habib.  The gorgeous scenery of Crete is also a big asset.  I found the film to be pretty suspenseful and engaging throughout.  I really wasn't sure just what was going to happen next.  It did keep me on the edge of my seat in some spots.  The only weak link was  a very rushed and uneventful conclusion, but otherwise very well-done.  This was Disney's answer to Hitchcock, and also an apparent attempt to get his young star, Miss Mills, into more adult roles after four years of excellent but very ""kiddie"" films for the studio. Unfortunately, she didn't get any more roles like this at Disney; her next and last was in ""That Darn Cat!"", a very enjoyable and funny film but still aimed more at kids.  She ended up having to leave the studio, do a nude scene in another film, and have an affair with an older man in order to become more adult in the eyes of the world.  Still, this was her starting point, and while Hitchcock could easily have topped this and any other suspense/mystery film, it's still fun to watch and suspenseful, never boring.  See it; you won't be sorry."
277,tt0256739,7,"This movie is based on the popular children's book, Emil and the Detectives. Emil lives with his long-term unemployed father in a small town in eastern Germany. His father finally finds work as a vacuum-cleaner salesman. Emil's mother has left to start a new life in Canada, so when his father has a car accident, has his license revoked and is in hospital, Emil is sent to stay with his teacher's sister in Berlin. However, on the train to Berlin he befriends a stranger, who drugs and robs him. From there, it's an old-fashioned adventure as Emil meets some street smart local kids who help him track down the thief. Stars Tobias Retzlaff, Anja Sommavilla and Jürgen Vogel. Directed by Franziska Buch"
278,tt0256739,4,"""Emil und die Detektive"" or ""Emil and the Detectives"" is a German film from 2001, in which writer and director Franziska Buch adapted the famous tale by children's books author Erich Kästner. I watched the 1930s and 1950s films about Emil, his gang and criminal Grundeis not too long ago and it becomes obvious how different they were compared to this one here. Clearly, Buch wanted to give the film a modern rework and there are many many aspects included that do not exist in these old films and probably also not in the book. Not sure about the latter as I have never read the book. One would be the kids rapping on several occasions, others would be Gustav's mother working in a church. Emil here lives with his father played by Karl Wiesinger early on. And also the story is about gems that the kids can recover and for which they are rewarded. And there is more criminals in here chasing the kids other than Grundeis. The latter here is played by Jürgen Vogel and he is enjoyable to watch as always, even if he gives Grundeis also a completely different approach. Still I must say that he is probably almost the only good thing about this movie. One major problem is that basically all the kids actors are pretty forgettable. The one who played Gusstav is the negative highlight here and Tobias Retzlaff who plays Emil is completely bland and not memorable at all. Sommavilla (Pony Hütchen) is still the best from the gang I guess and even she is nothing special at all. Good to see most of these left film when growing up as I cannot really see a good future for the bunch when it comes to acting. Overall, there were just not too many good moments in this 15-year-old film. I cannot recommend checking it out, especially people who love Emil (the book or the old films) should stay far far away. It's also way too long at over 105 minutes and that's why you find lots of forgettable filler material like the stuff I mentioned earlier. Thumbs down for this 2001 version."
279,tt0256739,8,"At first when i saw Emil & The detectives i did not think it was a children's film. I stumbled upon it in the school holidays when there was nothing to do.I thought it was going to be a sad drama film when i saw how Emil and his father lived - they seemed quite sad . I continued watching it to see how the film would go, but it wasn't what i expected. It's about a young boy, Emil who, because of unforeseen events, goes to Berlin to live with his teacher's sister. On the way more trouble lies, but luckily Emil has some new friends to help him out. This is probably the best German film i've seen so far. I recommend it for children under the age of 10. It also has some funny scenes. I give it 8 stars."
280,tt0256739,1,"While this movie certainly has it's flaws when watching it as a grown up, I still remember it watching it as a child. I completely remember how satisfying to watch this movie was back when I was a child myself. It was everything I could have asked for: Funny, adventurous, exciting and packed with a lot of action. This movie is easily my favorite child movie."
281,tt0256739,1,"I first watched this movie when i was in grade 6 while I was in Israel and I never stopped loving it. Over the years I have been looking for this movie in the US and Canada and couldn't find it. I was really disappointed but a couple of month ago when I was in Israel again I went into the BlockBuster (movie rental store) there, and there I saw Emil and the Detectives for purchasing and for a very cheap price too. So I quickly grabbed the opportunity and bought it. When I got home I was positive it was going to be German with subs but when i played the movie it was in English dubbed. I was amazed and I recommend if anyone wants to buy the movie to contact BlockBuster there and order it.I would rate this movie 10/10 just because it still makes me smile whenever I watch it."
282,tt0256739,7,"This engaging film takes a German children's classic of the 1920s and updates it to today's multicultural Berlin. The main characters appear to be between 8 and 12 years old, old enough to understand a lot about the world..but not everything, which adds some humor to the plot about a gang of children trying to track down a thief who has stolen money from the title character, young Emil. Some of the children are immigrants, some are homeless, and one is the son of a woman pastor. They travel through the streets of Berlin on skateboards, they rap about their adventures, and they are definitely not dutiful or respectful.I saw this movie at a film festival, and I think it would make a good family movie. Unfortunately, young Americans don't have much patience with subtitles, and it has never been released in the U.S., nor, apparently, is it on DVD."
283,tt0059793,8,"Sleuthing in suburbia--Disney style--after a small town teller is kidnapped by two bank robbers. Not only does this comedy feature the least-objectionable performance by Dean Jones ever, it also has Hayley Mills and Dorothy Provine as a wonderfully kooky pair of sisters and a fantastic feline hero. This Siamese cat is just gorgeous, and it's a lot of fun watching the bumbling humans trying to tail him down alleys and city streets. The bad guys of the piece (Neville Brand and Frank Gorshin) are also perfect, threatening but not overbearing, with just enough menace to make the kidnapped woman's predicament a little scary. I also loved the wacky next-door neighbors (Elsa Lanchester and William Demarest), Hayley's surfer-boyfriend named Canoe (Tom Lowell), and befuddled Ed Wynn as a jewelry salesman. Simply put, a wonderful modern-day caper for parents and kids which puts the remake with Christina Ricci to shame. ***1/2 from ****"
284,tt0061135,1,"This movie is excellent. Funny gags throughout the film and just a great comedic story. If you are a dog lover than you will be an ""Ugly Dachshund"" fan. The dogs are adorable and the actors do their part to make this wonderful family comedy. Totally under-rated.I suggest sitting down a group of young kids and asking them what they think of it, I'll bet that the movie keeps their attention from beginning to end. This is a classic Disney movie on the same level as the ""Love Bug"" series and all of the other great film s released by the company during those years.I recommend ""The Ugly Dachshund"" to anyone who loves family movies. *****"
285,tt0061135,1,"A fairy tale update of the classic story, this beautifully art-directed Disney movie in glorious Technicolor, stars Dean Jones at the height of his comedic powers and a very young Suzanne Pleshette.  Mark (Jones) adopts Brutus, a lovable oaf of a Great Dane, who, try as he might, can't fit in with Fran's (Pleshette) spoiled prize Dachshunds (think Lady and the Tramp's evil Siamese cats).  The film is full of sight gags and slapstick from director Norman Tokar (The Cat from Outer Space, M*A*S*H).  In true Disney fashion, the underdog wins out and saves the day."
286,tt0061135,1,"As an adult, I watch it over and over again! This is indeed one of the cutest movies I've ever seen and not to mention the best. If your child likes dogs, this is a MUST see film. Some films involving animals have some terribly sad tragedy included but this film keeps it light and fun. It still contains a happy ending and you'll giggle all the way through!"
287,tt0061135,6,"Dean Jones' second film for Walt Disney came via this minor but lively family comedy co-starring another Disney regular, the late Suzanne Pleshette (as his wife) – plus veteran comic Charlie Ruggles (appropriately cast as their vet {sic}) and soon-to-be popular Asian actor Mako (as a cowardly caterer). Although the plot sticks strictly to formula, dog lovers should be able to get a satisfactory amount of enjoyment out of this lightweight farce about a Great Dane, who being raised with a litter of dachshunds, creates all manner of chaos when he grows too large for their company and, besides, suffers from identity crisis at the most inopportune moments (namely a competitive dog show). In fact, apart from the likable pair of leads, the film's trump card is the various slapstick sequences that involve the naïve but fiercely protective Great Dane chasing the amiably anarchic dachshunds around the house (especially during an all-important garden party). Apart from the Asian caterers, a regular victim of the Great Dane's harmless ferocity is an overzealous cop who, in the film's most amusing non-canine incident, gives Jones the mother of all tickets."
288,tt0060640,8,"The Aircraft Carrier in this movie is USS Kitty Hawk. I was a radioman stationed on the 'Hawk when Disney came aboard in San Diego and filmed some launches and recoveries. When we returned to San Diego the Disney crew left to go make the movie, and Kitty Hawk left for the Western Pacific and Viet Nam. When we returned eight months later, the world premiere of Lt. Robin Crusoe, USN was held right there on the ship. Disney studios came aboard and turned Hangar Bay #1 into quite a nice theater. Having been an usher in theaters in my home town of Las Vegas NV, I was assigned some ushering duty for that premiere (and I got to meet Dick van Dyke and Nancy Kwan!) Not the ""greatest"" movie of all time, but very entertaining."
289,tt0060640,6,"As I've said before, I will go just about anywhere, cinematically, for a chance to hear Nancy Kwan's charming Hong Kong accent and to see her fabulous zygomatic bones. Case in point: ""Lt. Robin Crusoe, U.S.N.,"" a silly but entertaining Disney flick from 1966. In this one, the titular Navy fighter pilot, played by the ever-likable Dick van Dyke, is forced down into the drink of the South Pacific and, like his namesake, washes ashore on a deserted island. In the film's first half, Robin builds himself a house, discovers a decades-old Japanese submarine wreck and finds another castaway: the astro chimp Floyd! In the latter half, he finds an island mate of a more toothsome nature, a native girl who he dubs Wednesday (even though her pidgin English is perfectly fine and she's quite capable of revealing her true name), played by our Nancy, natch. And then Crusoe gets embroiled in a battle between Wednesday and dozens of her gal pals, versus her headhunter father and the devil god Kabuna. Anyway, van Dyke gives a broadly comedic performance, Floyd offers up some of the best simian thesping that I've ever seen (just look at his reaction shots during a poker game!), and Akim Tamiroff, in his role of headhunter Tanamashu, is a caricatured embarrassment. And Nancy? She is just adorable, never cuter than when playing charades in one segment; van Dyke's desire to leave his island paradise with Wednesday as his bride really does stretch the viewer's credulity past the breaking point. Six years after her yummy ""Suzie Wong"" debut, Nancy Kwan, a gorgeous Eurasian, was still one of the sexiest actresses that ANY continent had to offer; heck, she's still a looker today, at the age of 71! Besides some good performances, the picture provides some situations that are so very stoopid they're actually pretty funny (such as when Robin laboriously builds a sextant to determine his bearings, only to have it report that he's somewhere between Elmira, New York and Muncie, Indiana!), as well as some very attractive scenery (it was shot on the Hawaiian island of Kauai). The fifth-highest-grossing picture of 1966, the film was nonetheless critically drubbed but remains fun escapism 45 years later. It is an absolute must for all fans of Nancy Kwan and a perfect film to watch with your favorite 8-year-old...."
290,tt0060640,9,"This is an all time classic Disney flick, and TOTALLY underrated. I used to watch this all night long when I was sick. The humor and silliness of the film always made me feel better. Now, as an adult, I see so much more in the film. Of course you have Dick Van Dyke, who is a comic genius, who steals the show with his physical comedy, but underneath it, the film takes on some serious issues. I've used the film to teach about the women's rights movement in the USA, and even to explain the spread of democratic ideals, and the effect it can have on a society. Really! The most important thing is that this is a wholesome, family fun comedy. It makes hardened teenagers laugh, and I always get comments about how good it is. They always say ""I thought it was going to be stupid, but it was really ________ (good, funny, cute, fun, fill in your own positive). High praise indeed! I was frequently told that ""The guy from Mary Poppins is funny, but Floyd steals the show!"" I absolutely recommend this flick. It is one of the all time best!"
291,tt0060408,1,"The 1966 Walt Disney film, The Fighting Prince of Donegal was a bright memory for those of us who saw it first run in 1966. My friends and I bought the book upon which the film was based. It was an opportunity to consider Irish history not told in the encyclopedia and the junior high textbooks available in our town. We followed the acting career of Susan Hampshire as far as we could.For extra fun, We wrote short fictional stories and scenes to embellish parts we liked. We also wrote new fiction time travel stories based using these historic Irish settings. It was a lot of fun.I write this to say that we hope someday to find the film, hope to buy it, and see it again. Should anyone be listening, this is a film that should be brought back out for sale."
292,tt0060408,7,"American audiences tended to get only the glorified English version of the Tudor period in films...so this vastly pleasing piece of swashbuckling came as a breath of fresh air, telling the story from the Irish viewpoint for a change. The Disney studios had earlier tried their figurative hand at Scots history with Rob Roy; the Highland Rogue, an interesting but less successful and flawed attempt. It wasn't until the 1995 films of Rob Roy and Gibson's Braveheart that we got a better idea of the other side. Peter McEnery, at that time a great favorite Romantic lead from the previous Disney hit ""Moonspinners"" opposite Hayley Mills, had just proved in the French film ""La Curee"" that he was ripe for more mature roles. The Irish prince Red Hugh O'Donnel turned out to be arguably his best and most sympathetic role to date, a truly dashing and romantic swashbuckling hero. If you like costume epics, don't miss this one!"
293,tt0060420,7,"I was very pleased to see that Disney finally released this movie on DVD. I have been wanting to see it for a long time, but not only because it was another Disney film with Fred MacMurray. Rather, I am a Scout Leader, and can relate to many of the things in the picture, and that made it a special delight for me.This was Kurt Russell's first Disney picture. He is wonderful here as the reluctant boy with a drunken father. While he loves his dad, he is embarrassed when others see him. I have seen scouts in these positions.With my two sons in Scouting, they enjoyed this movie very much. Even my daughter, who is a Girl Scout, liked it too. A measure of a great film is when it makes you want to see it again. Out of my usual four-star rating system, I would give this: ***.5"

Drop dead gorgeous.Seeing it again a few years later, it didn't feel the same but the movie is still good light entertainment.I guess all shows seem a lot better when you're young. Nevertheless, its better than some other stuff out there that I've revisited, hence the 7 rating.If I see it out on DVD on a cheap label I plan to buy it."
295,tt0061989,7,"Not the best film ever, but with this many monkeys it can't be at all bad. Definitely worth watching. I suppose maurice chevalier also lends some class to the film. But the monkeys are the real reason for watching it. They're great. It can't be long until someone remakes this."
296,tt0061989,4,"Residents of a French village attempt to stop an American from using monkeys in place of human workers on his newly-acquired olive farm. Poor screenplay from G.K. Wilkinson's book ""The Monkeys"" actually wants us to sympathize with the land-owner, who should perhaps be forced to do his own olive picking! Forgettable Disney product with the expected slapstick interludes is well-made, if not fresh. OK performances by Dean Jones, Yvette Mimieux and wily Maurice Chevalier (in his final film), but the argument at the center of the story isn't expanded upon, and the romance which sketchily develops between Dean and Yvette seems like an afterthought as well. Obviously, this was aimed at a younger crowd, but why not give kids something to think about as well as to laugh at? *1/2 from ****"
297,tt0061989,4,"The last time Maurice Chevalier appeared before a movie camera was in this anemic comedy from the Magic Kingdom, Monkeys Go Home. Although he would contribute his voice for an animated Disney project, The Aristocats, this was his farewell to the cinema. Not the best film for France's ambassador to the world to go out on.Chevalier is the village priest and confidante of young American Dean Jones who has inherited some land in the south of France and olive groves to go with it. I will say this for the film, I learned more about the growing and harvesting of the olives more than I ever expected. The problem is in the harvesting, but Dean's got that licked so he thinks with the training of four female chimpanzees to do the labor. The chimps do work cheap and that upsets a lot of plans including those of Clement Harrari the villain of our piece who is a real estate entrepreneur. Nice to see some of them are as unscrupulous in France as they are on this side of the pond. Harrari has as a henchman Bernard Worringer who is jealous because Yvette Mimieux likes the new American settler better than him.Monkeys Go Home just doesn't quite get off the ground as a comedy, Dean Jones would have to wait until he found a Volkswagen with a soul before he scored big in Disney films. One bit I thought was a bit much for the Disney family studio. Yvette Mimieux believes in all work and no play is not good for the four female chimpanzees and buys a male. Now you don't have to have a degree in animal husbandry to figure out what's going to happen to your simian work force at that point. I'm surprised that bit got out at the Magic Kingdom.Maurice Chevalier is usual dapper and charming self, I do so wish he had a better film to make his exit with."
298,tt0061989,2,"Speaking as someone who has made an extensive study of the live-action Disney films of the 1960s-1970s I can say with some authority that this is truly one of the worst films ever released by Disney; almost unwatchable. With the charming Dean Jones and Yvette Mimieux at the center of a romantic plot this film has its moments (along with a delightful Maurice Chevalier, in what is a small role though curiously first-billed), but it is constantly derailed by the need to add monkey antics to the mix. Bringing in trained animals is a constant source of mirth in Disney live action gimmick comedies; it works in a Bubblegum Pop/ College Comedy setting (see the Disney film ""The Monkeys Uncle"") but against the backdrop of an American desperately trying to save an olive farm in Provence the entire film just fights against itself for a hundred minutes. Supporting characters rage about for no apparent reason, constantly entering and exiting the plot with no apparent motivation; and we are supposed to believe (and the plot hinges) on the concept that the entire village would be outraged that a man would use trained monkeys to pick olives for a harvest that last but three days a year instead of hiring locals is a stretch even by Disney standards (and this is the studio that convinced us a boy could turn into a dog and a car could have a mind of its own).This was released in the year following Walt Disney's death. One might wonder if he would have chucked the entire thing rather than release this to theatres under the Disney name. It is truly shocking that this film made it to DVD before many other, better-remembered titles from the era."
299,tt0061989,6,"I don't have any negative feelings towards this, yet I have nothing for it positively either - there's no real enjoyment or entertainment to be had.'Monkeys, Go Home!' starts off intriguingly, but to me as soon as the monkeys turn up it loses all interest - which, as you can imagine, isn't great considering the title. It just sleepwalks through its run time.Dean Jones (Hank), Maurice Chevalier (Sylvain) and Yvette Mimieux (Maria) all give decent performances, but unfortunately for them everything else about the film is just so average. As for the other cast members, Bernard Woringer (Marcel) & Clément Harari (Emile) are OK antagonists.The score is solid while the locations look pretty good. However, sadly, I can't really majorly praise much else about this. Even if there are worse films out there, of course."
300,tt0061333,8,"It's a pity this film isn't more well-known. ""Bullwhip Griffin,"" is one of the better live-action Disney films of the 60's. Roddy McDowell is perfectly cast and delivers an appealing performance in the title role. Disney was wise to give leading roles to ""character actors"" from time to time. Like Angela Lansbury in ""Bedknobs and Broomsticks,"" McDowell proves that he's strong enough to carry an entire picture when given the opportunity. The kid-actor who accompanies him in his adventures is useful and not obnoxious. Suzanne Pleshette is just amazing, especially in her ""San Francisco"" musical number. She is the sexiest saloon-hall singer you could hope to find in a G-rated film!"
301,tt0061333,7,"This is another fondly remembered Walt Disney live-action effort which I'd never watched: it's an episodic Western spoof set at the time of the California gold rush. The protagonists are an impoverished Bostonian family and their resourceful butler (an ideally-cast Roddy McDowall); the young son, obsessed with a legendary rugged cowboy figure called ""Bullwhip"", is prone to tall tales  so that he makes up the mild-mannered Griffin to be as brave and experienced as his hero!This eventually lands them in trouble with both con-man Karl Malden (who has a lot of fun with his role, which also allows him to don plenty of disguises) and saloon owner Harry Guardino or, more precisely, his imposing but dumb henchman (a typecast Mike Mazurki)  whom McDowall fells with a lucky punch but which Guardino wants to turn to his advantage by organizing a boxing match between the two! The bout is delayed until the climax: in between, our heroes have several adventures as they make and lose a fortune in gold (following a map possessed by Richard Haydn who's constantly flaunting his theatrical background), with the wily Malden never too far off their trail. Suzanne Pleshette provides feminine interest and eye candy, though she doesn't quite cut it as a saloon chanteuse.The film is a generous 110 minutes long (compounded by those relentless Sherman Brothers songs) but it's never less than enjoyable, with pleasant color photography and a barrage of technical gags (not just the animated titles but such oft-used devices as the subject of a portrait changing his expression, angels sounding their trumpets when someone is knocked-out, etc)."
302,tt0061333,7,"This oldie finally showed up again -- and I hope it continues to bring laughter to many others. Watching Roddy McDowall reminds me how long he has entertained us, too often without recognition. Karl Malden makes a wonderful villain, in so many guises!! Susanne Pleshette shows off her singing talent while appearing to have a ball making this movie. In fact, it appears everyone involved enjoyed their work. The plot moves from Boston (after the reading of a will that seems unbelievable) to California's gold rush. Adventures and misadventures are encountered by a boy, his sister and their butler, along with colorful characters along the way. Not until well into the movie do we see the love interest played out. I don't know how critics view it, but for fun entertainment, this is well worth our time."
303,tt0061333,7,"Playing the title role of Bullwhip Griffin is Roddy McDowell, a gentleman's gentleman and guardian to heirs Bryan Russell and Suzanne Pleshette from Boston. It seems as though their father has died and the family fortune isn't quite what they've been led to believe. Never mind that, young Russell has lived on an intellectual diet of dime novels and is convinced that he can go to California and strike it rich with the Gold Rush.The Adventures Of Bullwhip Griffin has a Mark Twain feel to it and it's not too bad, I think Mr. Clemens might have approved of it in his younger and less cynical days. The chief villain of the piece is Karl Malden playing a confidence man who goes by the name of 'Judge' Griffin. He's a man full of tricks, he's a lot like the 'king' and 'duke' characters from Huckleberry Finn. Twain would have really relished Malden's performance.As for Roddy McDowall he's as innocent as those Americans going abroad for the first time as tourists in Innocents Abroad. In point of fact San Francisco and the gold fields of California were a whole continent away and might as well been a foreign country. In fact McDowall would have been more at home in London than in San Francisco had he gone east instead of west.But this is America and it's the land of no titled classes. McDowall dares dream he too could win the hand of Suzanne Pleshette who has shaken her proper eastern upbringing to sing in Harry Guardino's Barbary Coast saloon. Guardino is another villain playing his part with relish, he's interested in Pleshette for more than her singing career.Highlight of the film is McDowall taking on Mike Mazurki in a prize fight. Only in the movies would you think that McDowall could beat Mazurki in a fight. Still it's a very funny sequence.The cast looks like they're having a real good time making this film and the enthusiasm is infectious. The Adventures Of Bullwhip Griffin is one of the better products to come from the Magic Kingdom in the Sixties."
304,tt0061333,8,If you like old movies on the order of Support your Local Sheriff you will like this one.  It's fun in a kooky sort of way.  It was refreshing to see Roddy McDowell in such a nice role.  I have watched it twice in the last 3 months on the Disney channel. I really recommend it.
305,tt0061333,9,"This movie is sweet, fun, entertaining for the whole family.  For those who appreciate the more innocent days that are no longer.  (The boxing match scene is a bit overdone though.) Roddy and Suzanne are cute together. Can't understand why this is not available on VHS!"
306,tt0061333,1,"This a Disney film that most people have never heard of and, to me, it is one of the funniest. OK, some of it is a little hokey, but, by and large, it is a film the whole family can enjoy. Roddy McDowall is perfect as the straight-laced butler who tries his best to help his young friend in the gold fields of 1849 California. Suzanne Pleshette (beautiful as ever) plays the love interest that Bullwhip can't bring himself to admit. She can also belt out a pretty good barroom tune. Add a crooked judge who is also a thief, one of the funniest fist fights ever filmed and likable villains and you have an entertaining romp in the old west."
307,tt0061333,7,"Just don't let Brian hear Stewie pronounce the title!'The Adventures of Bullwhip Griffin' is a strange one. From start-to-finish I never once cared for the actual premise to this, but unusually that actually isn't a negative as the film doesn't either! It's just one that is all about the adventure and it's certainly entertaining in that way, even if the supposed point of it does get lost almost completely.The casting is splendid. Roddy McDowall gives a very good performance in the titular role, while Suzanne Pleshette (Arabella), Bryan Russell (Jack), Karl Malden (Higgins) and Mike Mazurki (Ox) are all enjoyable too.The editing and humour is pretty solid as well, even if it does get a little weird in parts. I can't honestly rate this any higher, but it is a film I had a fairly fun time with - despite the earlier mentioned 'issues'. It's worth a watch.Lastly, if they ever remake this they gotta get Ioan Gruffudd in as Griffin, he'd be perfect. Not that I'm saying they should redo this, but you simply never know with film companies."
308,tt0061333,1,"With nothing else on cable , I happened upon this one night and I thought would be a good ride from Disney like 'Swiss Family Robinson' or 'Light of the Forest'. Here was a movie that took place in what was one of the most dynamic times and settings in US History (so far)-California,1848 and what a premise: a kid wants to make things right for his debt-ridden family by striking it rich in Californie having just heard about Sutter's Mill but his family retainer doesn't want him to come to harm so he follows along. Of course, in the opening scenes when discussing the late grandpa's will, the film has the geezer's painted pic make faces and the soundtrack making clanging noises. Thinking this was just a one-time anomaly, I'm willing to shrug that off so I could get to the eventual payoff. Will the boy (and retainer) make it to Californie in on that ship having to sail all the way around South America? And what's to become of the kid's much older sis Arabella played by the always fetching Suzanne Pleshette?Unfortunately, the Disney kiddie syndrome that starts with Grandpa's pic making faces intensifies as the picture gets more and more cartoonish. And the concept of the butler Griffin having an unspoken crush on Arabella that he's considering acting upon now that they're starting new lives in this very dynamic frontier city/world class port of San Francisco? Great idea but, unfortunately, Roddy McDowell's character just isn't able to muster believability in terms of being attracted to Arabella(paging Bob Newhart!). And what about the gold panning idea? It soon gets scuttled for some lame fighting deal the mouthy kid gets them into!Unfortunately, the whole thing ends in a complete mess with nothing resolved as an incoherent montage of buildings representing San Francisco in the future literally annihilates the on-screen action while the corny song screams over the remaining dialogue! Does this mean that Griffin became a major player in the building of Frisco and he got Suzanne? If so, how? Who can tell?So much potential could have been had with this movie but between miscasting McDowell and Disney kiddie stuff, it got totally ruined!"
309,tt0061333,6,"After a really interesting start with the reading of a will, (and a portrait oil painting which amusingly changes it's countenance during each revealing cut-away) this standard Disney family comedy drags a little before a reasonably amusing boxing match at the end between 'Bullwhip' and 'The Ox', but overall this is very disappointing. There's some nice illustrated animated 'bookends' which divide up segments of the film with music (similar idea to 'Cat Ballou') but it's nowhere near in the same league as that film. It's a shame as I was expecting this film to be a lot better. Bizarrely, one of the main characters disappears a third of the way into the film and then turns up again near the end. Feels slightly disjointed. The acting is quite good and Roddy McDowall was perfectly cast. I like the way in which the 'Ox' character throws people through the air in a ridiculously exaggerated manner – which is reasonably slapstick funny and actually quite cleverly done. There are some nice typical 'Disney-fied' matte painted wide scenes."
310,tt3040964,9,"I've never been a fan of the original Jungle Book movie, but I did grow up watching it, and I did like it. This remake is (in my opinion) Disney's best remake so far.The animation and the scenery is basically a new age in CGI. Not only are there CGI characters and creatures now, but locations too. The entire jungle looks absolutely real, yet it's not, and that's the great thing about it.The characters themselves were pretty cool. I didn't care for Mowgli in the original movie, but this movie got me liking him. He's brave, not as bratty, and he's pretty inventive. Bagheera is as stern and careful as ever except that he's also got the action his book counterpart had had. And I like Baloo's character here, having a bit more of a self-serving trait his older counterparts never had but eventually becoming a nice guy. And that's the main characters. The wolves got more screen time, Kaa got a lot more dangerous (though she doesn't have as much screen time, which is my only complaint in this movie), King Louie is more sinister and less comical, and Shere Khan is a flat-out beast.I'm also glad that they brought back three songs I enjoyed as a kid. I really liked Bare Necessities, and I've also started singing this version of I Wanna Be Like You. Trust In Me made me feel like Kaa was in a spy movie.So on a scale from one to ten, I'd give it a perfect score: 10/10. It's an epic movie, and I highly recommend seeing this movie."

Along the way, Mowgli learns valuable life lessons as his epic journey of self-discovery leads to fun and adventure.Disney Picture is the best company in making top and number 1 family movies.Everything is excellent about this movie.I guarantee you this top movie will win too many Oscars."
312,tt3040964,6,"The Jungle Book has been raved about by everyone I know, but now that I've finally seen it I don't quite understand what all the hype is about. It's true that the CG is nothing short of outstanding, especially considering a lot of it is done during the day instead of at night, and I'm impressed with how much they were able to accomplish, but a pretty movie and an exceptional movie are not at all the same thing; similarly, a better than average movie and an exceptional movie are not the same thing, and this movie is better than average.The writing wasn't great, but it was passable. This is a kid's movie after all, and while I don't in any way think that's an excuse for a movie to have a worse script than any other, it's important to understand that the film still needs to keep the children entertained with silly jokes and easy-to-understand dialogue. My main problem with the film was the child actor. I'm not expecting a 12-year-old kid to be able act like an A-Lister, but there was one particular shot were he screamed and I accidentally laughed in the near-silent theater because it seemed to out of place and awkward. He was also given outrageously simple and cliché lines. It was always ""I'm doing this thing because of this other thing"" and felt like the majority of his talking was done explaining to other characters that he had to reach is his goal instead of developing his character. There were a few scenes where he was able to act like a normal kid, and those were definitely his best performances, but overall he wasn't able to give it his all because what he was supplied with wouldn't allow him to.The other characters were played well, and the animators did a good job with the choreography of all the fights. Bill Murray was a great choice for Baloo, and at this point I can't think of any other voice that could have given a bear that much character.The songs, however, felt out of place and forced, and that's all I'm going to say about those.I do not dislike this movie in any sense, and I recommend that people go and see it. At it's heart it is a very good story, and one that I very much enjoy. I'm sure that the nostalgia of revisiting your childhood will help you enjoy it more than I did, because the only scene I'd ever seen from the 1967 movie was the one with the singing monkeys, so there wasn't a lot in the film to connect to my past."

314,tt3040964,7,"The Jungle Book is a live-action/CGI fantasy film that retells the story of Mowgli, an orphaned human boy who, guided by his animal guardians, sets out on a journey of self-discovery while evading the threatening Shere Khan. Neel Sethi plays the main character, Mowgli in the movie. He is the only human being on screen and as his first ever role, this kid actor is truly magnificent. He is as good as any kid actor has ever been, even favorably compared to Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense. The computer generated imagery is brilliant all throughout, definitely some of the best ever and the 3D is just mind blowing. In every single scene I kept getting surprised and thrilled at just how amazing the CGI and 3D were. I think the main reason as to why this movie worked it's because it also has a very good story line that's mixed in with the amazing visuals. Also, the voice actors are all perfectly cast. Especially Idris Elba as Shere Khan, who is truly haunting in every scene he's in. That was one well made and scary villain that Mowgli had to face. Jon Favreau did a fantastic work with this movie, cause really this story has been told many times before, and yet this movie feels fresh and interesting nonetheless. I'm glad that it's doing so well in Box Office because it completely deserves it. Movies like this must be appreciated so that they can inspire more great work, and maybe one day, even erase movies like Transformers."
315,tt3040964,3,"In a word... ""Flat."" Seeing this remake only left me wanting to see the old cartoon once again. I loved the old cartoon as a kid and can easily recall many details decades later. Conversely, I just saw the new one and it just blends in with a bunch of other fantasy-adventure /superhero / CGI remakes of late.In general, this remake just felt like it had no soul.In particular, they didn't develop the characters much. It was obvious the film-makers didn't care about the main characters much so why should we either? I guess the special effects or CGI were impressive, especially the talking animals, but that's been done so much its just not a big deal anymore. They can't base a whole movie on those effects anymore and just touch on a few songs. The singing and music in the old version was so much more developed, energetic and memorable.The guest voice-overs were good but too recognizable. I kept thinking of Bill Murray talking into a mic instead of watching the fake bear talk. To be fair, Ben Kingsley pulled off the character very smoothly. But why did they make that orangutang so huge? Was he King Kong's lost brother? And voiced by Christopher Walken it really didn't make sense. Jungle animals are already awesome, you don't need to enlarge them or make up new ones.A high point of the movie was when Mogli helped the elephant baby from the pit. More of this tenderness would have been welcome, which brings me to the next point...This story was always potentially very violent; we're talking about jungle law here- brutal life and death is always near. But while the old cartoon version separated that violence enough from reality to make it safe and enjoyable for a younger audience, the new one crossed the line. It was too real, in my opinion, for most kids under about 11 or so. True, many kids play violent computer games from earlier ages now, so some would argue they can ""handle it"", but is that the kind of trend for them you want to support? I would argue the more we desensitize the youth now, the less sensitive they will be later on when they may be taking care of us when we're seniors. Do we want such thoroughly insensitive people running society in the future? So, while yes- it was exciting, I think this production really narrowed their audience down to the preteens (for whom it may be too violent) and the teenagers (for whom it may be too kiddie- you know with the talking animals and all). So sorry Disney, I've so often loved your movies, but not this time."
316,tt3040964,5,"This was certainly an amazing looking film, and knowing it was all computer generated is almost worrisome--computers are capable of so much now, practical effects are becoming endangered. The story was very familiar to me going in. It was one of the most beloved films of my childhood, and the original Disney film still looks amazing today. I don't know why, but nothing about this version interested me. Some of the differences are easy to pick out--there is no comparison between the original Baloo and the Bill Murray performance for me, as I much prefer the original. Most of the rest of the movie, I just didn't care about. King Louie, Shere Khan, even Mowgli--they just feel empty and uninspired. I didn't dislike it, I just didn't feel that I would ever want to watch it again."
317,tt3040964,1,"Mowgli (Neel Sethi) is a man-cub raised by the Indian wolf Raksha (Lupita Nyong'o) and her pack led by Akela (Giancarlo Esposito) ever since he was brought to them as a baby by the black panther Bagheera (Ben Kingsley). Bagheera trains Mowgli to learn the ways of the wolves but Mowgli faces certain challenges and lags behind his wolf siblings, and Bagheera berates him for using human tricks like tool building, instead of learning the ways of the pack. One day, during the dry season, all the animals in the jungle gather at the Peace Rock to drink the water that remains as part of the Water Truce, a timeout called during a drought that enables all animals to gather at a water hole without fear of being eaten by larger, more predatory animals. The peaceful gathering is disrupted when the fearsome Bengal tiger Shere Khan (Idris Elba) makes his presence felt. He detects Mowgli's scent amongst the crowd and threatens his life since man is not welcome in the jungle. He holds the scars on his face as proof of man's cruel and destructive nature and issues a warning that when the Water Truce ends and the Peace Rock disappears, he will come for the boy. Thus, a debate and argument arises amongst the members of the wolf pack as to whether or not they should keep Mowgli. But before a general consensus is reached, Mowgli voluntarily decides to leave the jungle for the sake and safety of his pack. Bagheera volunteers to guide him to the human civilization. However, en-route, Shere Khan ambushes them, injuring Bagheera while Mowgli manages to escape with the help of a herd of water buffaloes. Mowgli, now alone, stumbles upon a thick canopy where he meets Kaa (Scarlett Johansson), an enormous Indian python who lures him in with promises of safety and an assurance that she knows who and what Mowgli truly is. Kaa's hypnosis shows Mowgli a vision of his father being killed by Shere Khan and of himself as an abandoned infant being found by Bagheera and also warns of the destructive power of man's ""red flower"". Having successfully wrapped Mowgli in her coils, Kaa attempts to devour Mowgli, but he is rescued by a sloth bear named Baloo (Bill Murray). In exchange for saving Mowgli's life, Baloo tells Mowgli to fetch him honey which is atop a cliff, to which Mowgli unwillingly agrees. Together, they form a close bond and Mowgli decides to stay with Baloo until the winter season arrives. Back in the jungle, Shere Khan visits the wolf pack looking for the ""man- cub."" When Akela states that Mowgli has left the pack, Shere Khan kills Akela by throwing him off the cliff. He demands that the boy be handed over to him. Confident that Mowgli will return again, Shere Khan takes over the pack. When Bagheera returns to fetch Mowgli, he discovers that Mowgli has decided to live with Baloo. Although tension is raised between the three, they all agree to sleep on it until the following morning. At night, Mowgli hears a cry for help and discovers that a baby Indian elephant is trapped in a deep pit. Using his tricks, he fashions a rope to rescue the baby elephant. This forms a bond between Mowgli and the Indian elephants. Following Bagheera's instructions, Baloo unwillingly confronts Mowgli and lies to him that he never considered him a friend, hoping that Mowgli can change his mind about staying with him. But Mowgli is suddenly abducted by a group of monkeys who take him to an ancient ruined temple and present him to King Louie (Christopher Walken), a Bornean orangutan-resembling Gigantopithecus who tries to coerce Mowgli into giving up the secret to the elusive and deadly ""red flower"". Baloo and Bagheera arrive just in time to distract the monkeys and manage to hold them off while Mowgli flees into hiding. King Louie chases Mowgli through the temple, causing it to crumble on top of him. Before Mowgli leaves, King Louie informs him of Akela's demise. Furious of the fact that Baloo and Bagheera kept him in the dark about Akela's death, Mowgli decides to return to the jungle and confront Shere Khan to avenge the death of his leader and end his tyranny. But first, Mowgli ventures into the village where the humans live and for the first time, he sees his own kind from afar and gazes at them in amazement. He steals one of the burning torches and heads back to the jungle but accidentally starts a fire. Baloo and Bagheera follow him in close pursuit. When the news breaks out that a man with the ""red flower"" is making his way into the jungle, all the animals gather at the Peace Rock. Mowgli confronts Shere Khan, but sees how all the animals of the jungle cower in fear at the sight of the fire he holds. He throws away his torch into the water, allowing Shere Khan to attack him. Bagheera, Baloo and the wolf pack manage to hold him off, thus buying Mowgli enough time to set a trap in the burning jungle. He lures Shere Khan into a dying tree with a fig branch and is able to coax him into stepping on it, causing it to break. Shere Khan falls to his death into the pit of fire below. The Indian elephants later help to extinguish the fire by diverting the river. Raksha then becomes the new Alpha and leads the wolf pack. Mowgli decides to do things his own way, having at last found a true home in the jungle with the animals, including his friends Baloo and Bagheera."

It has been said in reviews that this film was  supposed to compete with the earlier success of Mary Poppins and while the box office or revenue reports will show that the masses did not experience it, it  does not show that they would not have appreciated it.

How could I even forget a minor character like the vultures, and their jokes on Shere Khan? Their humor was great in contrast with the tiger's ego. I thought I would revive all those memories watching this movie. I was wrong.This movie is lacking of various things. First, a good plot. Second, good characters with relevant appearances. Third, humour (nonexistent if we ignore Balu) and a good atmosphere for songs (is this supposed to be a musical?). And fifth but not least, WHAT IS KING KONG DOING IN KING LOUI'S TEMPLE?? What they have done to that poor monkey is unbearable.MY SUMMARY(SPOILERS):King Loui doesn't dance. Shere Kahn doesn't bother to chase Mogli through the jungle. Why would him anyway? He already knows the plot. Kaa's appearance in the movie is what in Spanish we call ""postureo"". He appears once. He narrates Mowgli's origins to the spectator (how plot convenient...). He tries to eat the kid with no success and fades away to live happily ever after. The rest can be summarized in: f*ck logic. I have been walking for two days to get to the human village, and now I can just run away for 10 minutes with a torch in hand to get just where the movie started. Hi, my name is Mowgly and I like to burn down jungles in my free time (appaluse). AH AND THE VULTURES DON'T EVEN SPEAK IN THE WHOLE MOVIE, SAME AS THE ELEPHANTS which are considered gods among the other animals (wtf) and magically appear in the last scene to save the day.Please re watch the old movie instead of wasting your money in this thing. Why Loui?... Why?..."

Mowgli(Neel Sethi) has lived in the jungle, for as long as he can remember. In the jungle, he is raised by a pack of wolves, led by Akela(Giancarlo Esposito). A wolf named Raksha(Lupita Nyong'o), is the only mother he has ever known. He has an ally & a friend, in a panther named Bagheera(Ben Kingsley). When the treacherous tiger Shere Khan(Idris Elba), opposes to Mowgli staying in the jungle, Bagheera has to return the man-cub to the man village. While on their journey, Mowgli & Bagheera receive help from a grizzly bear, named Baloo(Bill Murray). Now, it is up to Bagheera & Baloo to take Mowgli to the man village, safe & sound. The Jungle Book is a mind blowing film. It is the most gorgeous movie, I have ever seen. What's extremely fascinating is that, the whole environment in the film is CGI. The animals are also CGI & yet, they look extremely lifelike. The forest the movie is set in, looks breathtaking. Director Jon Favreau & the rest of the crew, have maintained the soul of the 1967 animated movie of the same name. Kudos to the visual effects team, for making a live-action adaptation of a movie like The Jungle Book. Don't worry. This film is not a carbon copy of the Disney animated original. Favreau adds many new elements to the film, that will keep you guessing right till the end. The set pieces of the movie, are its highlight. The 3D provides immersion & there are quite a few scenes, that will make you duck in your seats. The casting is flawless. Newcomer Neel Sethi is outstanding as Mowgli. Sethi doesn't just play Mowgli, he embodies the character. Bill Murray is hilarious & adorable as Baloo. Murray & Sethi's rendition of The Bare Necessities, is as good as the 1967 version of the same song. Ben Kingsley is awesome as Bagheera. Idris Elba is spectacular as Shere Khan. Elba's voice-over of the predatory antagonist, is menacing & flawless. Lupita Nyong'o is amazing as Raksha. Nyong'o gives an emotional & layered performance, as the voice of Mowgli's adoptive mother. Scarlett Johansson is excellent as Kaa. I liked Johansson's version of Kaa, much better than the '67 incarnation of the sneaky snake. Giancarlo Esposito is great as Akela. Christopher Walken is superb as King Louie. The Jungle Book is a must watch on the big screen, with your entire family. Go, relive this timeless tale."
320,tt3040964,9,"I've never been a fan of the original Jungle Book movie, but I did grow up watching it, and I did like it. This remake is (in my opinion) Disney's best remake so far.The animation and the scenery is basically a new age in CGI. Not only are there CGI characters and creatures now, but locations too. The entire jungle looks absolutely real, yet it's not, and that's the great thing about it.The characters themselves were pretty cool. I didn't care for Mowgli in the original movie, but this movie got me liking him. He's brave, not as bratty, and he's pretty inventive. Bagheera is as stern and careful as ever except that he's also got the action his book counterpart had had. And I like Baloo's character here, having a bit more of a self-serving trait his older counterparts never had but eventually becoming a nice guy. And that's the main characters. The wolves got more screen time, Kaa got a lot more dangerous (though she doesn't have as much screen time, which is my only complaint in this movie), King Louie is more sinister and less comical, and Shere Khan is a flat-out beast.I'm also glad that they brought back three songs I enjoyed as a kid. I really liked Bare Necessities, and I've also started singing this version of I Wanna Be Like You. Trust In Me made me feel like Kaa was in a spy movie.So on a scale from one to ten, I'd give it a perfect score: 10/10. It's an epic movie, and I highly recommend seeing this movie."

Mowgli flees but the anaconda Kaa attacks him; however the bear Baloo saves him and they become friends. But Shere Khan wants to kill Mowgli and no animal is capable to stop him. What will happen to Mowgli?""The Jungle Book"" is an awesome film with fantastic CGI. It is impressive the interaction of Mowgli with the animals and the jungle. The wolf cubs are cute and the voice of Scarlett Johansson is mesmerizing. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil):""Mogli: O Menino Lobo"" (""Mogli: The Boy Wolf"")"
322,tt3040964,6,"The Jungle Book has been raved about by everyone I know, but now that I've finally seen it I don't quite understand what all the hype is about. It's true that the CG is nothing short of outstanding, especially considering a lot of it is done during the day instead of at night, and I'm impressed with how much they were able to accomplish, but a pretty movie and an exceptional movie are not at all the same thing; similarly, a better than average movie and an exceptional movie are not the same thing, and this movie is better than average.The writing wasn't great, but it was passable. This is a kid's movie after all, and while I don't in any way think that's an excuse for a movie to have a worse script than any other, it's important to understand that the film still needs to keep the children entertained with silly jokes and easy-to-understand dialogue. My main problem with the film was the child actor. I'm not expecting a 12-year-old kid to be able act like an A-Lister, but there was one particular shot were he screamed and I accidentally laughed in the near-silent theater because it seemed to out of place and awkward. He was also given outrageously simple and cliché lines. It was always ""I'm doing this thing because of this other thing"" and felt like the majority of his talking was done explaining to other characters that he had to reach is his goal instead of developing his character. There were a few scenes where he was able to act like a normal kid, and those were definitely his best performances, but overall he wasn't able to give it his all because what he was supplied with wouldn't allow him to.The other characters were played well, and the animators did a good job with the choreography of all the fights. Bill Murray was a great choice for Baloo, and at this point I can't think of any other voice that could have given a bear that much character.The songs, however, felt out of place and forced, and that's all I'm going to say about those.I do not dislike this movie in any sense, and I recommend that people go and see it. At it's heart it is a very good story, and one that I very much enjoy. I'm sure that the nostalgia of revisiting your childhood will help you enjoy it more than I did, because the only scene I'd ever seen from the 1967 movie was the one with the singing monkeys, so there wasn't a lot in the film to connect to my past."
324,tt3040964,7,"The Jungle Book is a live-action/CGI fantasy film that retells the story of Mowgli, an orphaned human boy who, guided by his animal guardians, sets out on a journey of self-discovery while evading the threatening Shere Khan. Neel Sethi plays the main character, Mowgli in the movie. He is the only human being on screen and as his first ever role, this kid actor is truly magnificent. He is as good as any kid actor has ever been, even favorably compared to Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense. The computer generated imagery is brilliant all throughout, definitely some of the best ever and the 3D is just mind blowing. In every single scene I kept getting surprised and thrilled at just how amazing the CGI and 3D were. I think the main reason as to why this movie worked it's because it also has a very good story line that's mixed in with the amazing visuals. Also, the voice actors are all perfectly cast. Especially Idris Elba as Shere Khan, who is truly haunting in every scene he's in. That was one well made and scary villain that Mowgli had to face. Jon Favreau did a fantastic work with this movie, cause really this story has been told many times before, and yet this movie feels fresh and interesting nonetheless. I'm glad that it's doing so well in Box Office because it completely deserves it. Movies like this must be appreciated so that they can inspire more great work, and maybe one day, even erase movies like Transformers."
325,tt3040964,3,"In a word... ""Flat."" Seeing this remake only left me wanting to see the old cartoon once again. I loved the old cartoon as a kid and can easily recall many details decades later. Conversely, I just saw the new one and it just blends in with a bunch of other fantasy-adventure /superhero / CGI remakes of late.In general, this remake just felt like it had no soul.In particular, they didn't develop the characters much. It was obvious the film-makers didn't care about the main characters much so why should we either? I guess the special effects or CGI were impressive, especially the talking animals, but that's been done so much its just not a big deal anymore. They can't base a whole movie on those effects anymore and just touch on a few songs. The singing and music in the old version was so much more developed, energetic and memorable.The guest voice-overs were good but too recognizable. I kept thinking of Bill Murray talking into a mic instead of watching the fake bear talk. To be fair, Ben Kingsley pulled off the character very smoothly. But why did they make that orangutang so huge? Was he King Kong's lost brother? And voiced by Christopher Walken it really didn't make sense. Jungle animals are already awesome, you don't need to enlarge them or make up new ones.A high point of the movie was when Mogli helped the elephant baby from the pit. More of this tenderness would have been welcome, which brings me to the next point...This story was always potentially very violent; we're talking about jungle law here- brutal life and death is always near. But while the old cartoon version separated that violence enough from reality to make it safe and enjoyable for a younger audience, the new one crossed the line. It was too real, in my opinion, for most kids under about 11 or so. True, many kids play violent computer games from earlier ages now, so some would argue they can ""handle it"", but is that the kind of trend for them you want to support? I would argue the more we desensitize the youth now, the less sensitive they will be later on when they may be taking care of us when we're seniors. Do we want such thoroughly insensitive people running society in the future? So, while yes- it was exciting, I think this production really narrowed their audience down to the preteens (for whom it may be too violent) and the teenagers (for whom it may be too kiddie- you know with the talking animals and all). So sorry Disney, I've so often loved your movies, but not this time."
326,tt3040964,5,"This was certainly an amazing looking film, and knowing it was all computer generated is almost worrisome--computers are capable of so much now, practical effects are becoming endangered. The story was very familiar to me going in. It was one of the most beloved films of my childhood, and the original Disney film still looks amazing today. I don't know why, but nothing about this version interested me. Some of the differences are easy to pick out--there is no comparison between the original Baloo and the Bill Murray performance for me, as I much prefer the original. Most of the rest of the movie, I just didn't care about. King Louie, Shere Khan, even Mowgli--they just feel empty and uninspired. I didn't dislike it, I just didn't feel that I would ever want to watch it again."
327,tt3040964,1,"Mowgli (Neel Sethi) is a man-cub raised by the Indian wolf Raksha (Lupita Nyong'o) and her pack led by Akela (Giancarlo Esposito) ever since he was brought to them as a baby by the black panther Bagheera (Ben Kingsley). Bagheera trains Mowgli to learn the ways of the wolves but Mowgli faces certain challenges and lags behind his wolf siblings, and Bagheera berates him for using human tricks like tool building, instead of learning the ways of the pack. One day, during the dry season, all the animals in the jungle gather at the Peace Rock to drink the water that remains as part of the Water Truce, a timeout called during a drought that enables all animals to gather at a water hole without fear of being eaten by larger, more predatory animals. The peaceful gathering is disrupted when the fearsome Bengal tiger Shere Khan (Idris Elba) makes his presence felt. He detects Mowgli's scent amongst the crowd and threatens his life since man is not welcome in the jungle. He holds the scars on his face as proof of man's cruel and destructive nature and issues a warning that when the Water Truce ends and the Peace Rock disappears, he will come for the boy. Thus, a debate and argument arises amongst the members of the wolf pack as to whether or not they should keep Mowgli. But before a general consensus is reached, Mowgli voluntarily decides to leave the jungle for the sake and safety of his pack. Bagheera volunteers to guide him to the human civilization. However, en-route, Shere Khan ambushes them, injuring Bagheera while Mowgli manages to escape with the help of a herd of water buffaloes. Mowgli, now alone, stumbles upon a thick canopy where he meets Kaa (Scarlett Johansson), an enormous Indian python who lures him in with promises of safety and an assurance that she knows who and what Mowgli truly is. Kaa's hypnosis shows Mowgli a vision of his father being killed by Shere Khan and of himself as an abandoned infant being found by Bagheera and also warns of the destructive power of man's ""red flower"". Having successfully wrapped Mowgli in her coils, Kaa attempts to devour Mowgli, but he is rescued by a sloth bear named Baloo (Bill Murray). In exchange for saving Mowgli's life, Baloo tells Mowgli to fetch him honey which is atop a cliff, to which Mowgli unwillingly agrees. Together, they form a close bond and Mowgli decides to stay with Baloo until the winter season arrives. Back in the jungle, Shere Khan visits the wolf pack looking for the ""man- cub."" When Akela states that Mowgli has left the pack, Shere Khan kills Akela by throwing him off the cliff. He demands that the boy be handed over to him. Confident that Mowgli will return again, Shere Khan takes over the pack. When Bagheera returns to fetch Mowgli, he discovers that Mowgli has decided to live with Baloo. Although tension is raised between the three, they all agree to sleep on it until the following morning. At night, Mowgli hears a cry for help and discovers that a baby Indian elephant is trapped in a deep pit. Using his tricks, he fashions a rope to rescue the baby elephant. This forms a bond between Mowgli and the Indian elephants. Following Bagheera's instructions, Baloo unwillingly confronts Mowgli and lies to him that he never considered him a friend, hoping that Mowgli can change his mind about staying with him. But Mowgli is suddenly abducted by a group of monkeys who take him to an ancient ruined temple and present him to King Louie (Christopher Walken), a Bornean orangutan-resembling Gigantopithecus who tries to coerce Mowgli into giving up the secret to the elusive and deadly ""red flower"". Baloo and Bagheera arrive just in time to distract the monkeys and manage to hold them off while Mowgli flees into hiding. King Louie chases Mowgli through the temple, causing it to crumble on top of him. Before Mowgli leaves, King Louie informs him of Akela's demise. Furious of the fact that Baloo and Bagheera kept him in the dark about Akela's death, Mowgli decides to return to the jungle and confront Shere Khan to avenge the death of his leader and end his tyranny. But first, Mowgli ventures into the village where the humans live and for the first time, he sees his own kind from afar and gazes at them in amazement. He steals one of the burning torches and heads back to the jungle but accidentally starts a fire. Baloo and Bagheera follow him in close pursuit. When the news breaks out that a man with the ""red flower"" is making his way into the jungle, all the animals gather at the Peace Rock. Mowgli confronts Shere Khan, but sees how all the animals of the jungle cower in fear at the sight of the fire he holds. He throws away his torch into the water, allowing Shere Khan to attack him. Bagheera, Baloo and the wolf pack manage to hold him off, thus buying Mowgli enough time to set a trap in the burning jungle. He lures Shere Khan into a dying tree with a fig branch and is able to coax him into stepping on it, causing it to break. Shere Khan falls to his death into the pit of fire below. The Indian elephants later help to extinguish the fire by diverting the river. Raksha then becomes the new Alpha and leads the wolf pack. Mowgli decides to do things his own way, having at last found a true home in the jungle with the animals, including his friends Baloo and Bagheera."

330,tt0061749,8,"Yes, ""The Happiest Millionaire"" was Walt Disney's last film. Yes, it was obviously made to top ""Mary Poppins"" and yes, like many late-sixties musicals, it flopped at the box office. But the fact remains that it is a glowing, beautifully made musical (with songs by the Sherman Brothers who were responsible for ""Poppins"") and it never got the recognition it truly deserved. The cast, headed by Disney Stalwart Fred MacMurray and legendary star Greer Garson (in her last film appearance) is excellent. The musical numbers are fun and engaging and the players do them well. Both Lesley Ann Warren and John Davidson were introduced in this film and proved an ideal pair of romantic leads. Warren, who became an overnight star courtesy of her delightful performance as Cinderella in the 1965 Rodgers and Hammerstein television musical, literally shines as Cordelia Drexel Biddle. Many scenes are stolen by Geraldine Page playing Davidson's haughty mother, and Tommy Steele can sing and dance with the best of them. There is also a grand performance from Gladys Cooper as the family matriarch. And, for ""Poppins"" fans, Hermione Baddely appears as the Irish housekeeper. There is also a brief bit by Joan Marshall, the star of William Castle's ""Homicidal"" (billed as Jean Arless) as a maid. The fact that this story is (loosely) based on the prominent Biddle family of Philadelphia, adds to the fun. Because the film was released after Disney's death and exhibitors complained about its long running time, it was drastically edited, shortening and removing several scenes, as well as one musical number (""It Won't Be Long Till Christmas""), and here is where the controversy comes in. Garson was originally cast as Mrs. Duke, after the part was turned down by several actresses, including Geraldine Page. Just before filming began however, Page changed her mind, and Greer ended up as Mrs. Biddle. (a part she was not anxious to play). She agreed to the switch when she heard the score--especially ""It Won't Be Long Till Christmas"" which was her one musical number. Indeed she COULD sing, and she did so in a few of her '40's films. Because her song was subsequently cut from the film (after it's Hollywood world premiere) she declined to attend any further premieres, though she had been at the Hollywood opening. Thanks to the newly restored roadshow edition, the song has been restored, and Garson and MacMurray perform it to perfection, truly the highlight of a warm and wonderful story that makes for perfect holiday viewing."
332,tt0061749,1,"I have always loved musicals, but I've never cared for the most popular ones from the 50s and 60s, such as ""The Sound Of Music"".  However, ""The Happiest Millionaire"" scores on every level.  The music is superb, and there's a ton of it.  Tommy Steele does indeed steal the show as a new immigrant who shows up for an interview to become a butler, not quite realizing how wacky the Biddle family really is.  His tunes are the most lively, particularly the bar scene.  However, others such as Fred Macmurray and Leslie Anne Warren really shine here too.  And who knew John Davidson had talents outside of being a game show host?  This is a real diamond in the rough.Some minor guidelines - the Roadshow edition has quite a bit of extra footage, and for those of us who know the standard edition by heart, it's great to find little bits and pieces (20 minutes worth, overall) that we've never seen, including parts of some of the songs.  However, the standard edition is a tighter movie and keeps things moving more quickly - and since the standard edition is already over 2 hours and 20 minutes, I'd recommend it first.  Then if you like it, the Roadshow gives you more of the best stuff.This was Disney's last picture, and from all accounts he loved it, even though it was unsuccessful due to being released at just the wrong time. With 30 years distance, though, it is still so much fun that I'd love to see it made into an actual Broadway show.  Oh, well, one can dream..."
333,tt0062737,8,"Blackbeard's Ghost is a live action picture out of Walt Disney Studios and it's directed by Robert Stevenson. It's based around the novel written by Ben Stahl, with the adaption for the screen by Don DaGradi & Bill Walsh. Starring are Peter Ustinov, Dean Jones, Suzanne Pleshette, Elsa Lanchester & Joby Baker.Plot finds Ustinov as the titular phantom of the title, who is suspended between worlds after a curse was put on him by his ex-wife. When amiable track coach Steve Walker (Jones) arrives in the coastal town of Godolphin he attends a charity sale and buys an antique bed warmer. Later that night Steve finds a hidden spell located in the bed warmer and after reading it out aloud he conjures up the ghost of Blackbeard. Seems that only Steve can see the bluff old pirate, and apparently Blackbeard can only escape his curse if he does a good deed. Good timing, then, since the old hotel run by the old ladies of Godolphin is under threat of closure from unscrupulous gambling gangster Silky Seymour (Baker) who wants to build a casino on the land. In spite of the fact that they just can't get on, Blackbeard and Steve may just be good for each other.A perfect light hearted live action film for the young and the young at heart. Looking a bit dated now on account of the advent of special effects, Blackbeard's Ghost none the less carries a weighty good against evil parable and brings on the laughter in spades as it goes. The set up is classic Disney, a pretty little coastal town is home to buccaneer secrets and the equilibrium is being upset by baddies who want progress to further their greed. Enter a bad boy coming good and the underdog sports team suddenly finding a new lease of life; aided wonderfully by Blackbeard during the film's funniest quarter. And there's even an engaging romance between Jones & Pleshette that's easy to warm too. The cast are inoffensive and pleasant, particularly Ustinov who is on full tilt pantomime overdrive, while the little devilish motif of cheating for the greater good finds Disney not hiding behind the syrup jar.Personally I laughed out loud on a number of occasions, most notably a cheerleader sequence that still has me giggling as I write this piece. Hopefully this film can have a similar effect on those looking at it for the very first time. Seek it out folks and watch with the family, for it is perfect family entertainment. 8/10"
334,tt0062737,1,"This movie had great memories from when I saw it as a kid.  Usually, the movie's never as good as it was, you know, when you see it again once you're older.  This one is still great, though!  The jokes and gags are, for the most part, routine and common, but I think Peter Ustinov made the movie. You just have to let go of everything and have fun with it."
335,tt0062737,8,"Watching Blackbeard's Ghost yesterday put me in mind of the late Robert Newton and his portrayal of Blackbeard in a classic film from the Fifties. Had Mr. Newton not died of chronic alcoholism in 1957, I'm sure he would have been the Disney studio's choice to play Blackbeard.With Robert Newton not being available, the studio got another actor famous for a bravura performance, that of Nero and Quo Vadis. Who'd have thought that Peter Ustinov would have gotten another role that called for flamboyant overacting. Ustinov's Blackbeard is a combination of Newton's Blackbeard and his own Nero. And he dominates the film completely.Dean Jones who was Disney's major leading man at the time who played the roles Kurt Russell was too young for, borrows a great deal from that other actor, who's career Disney rejuvenated, Fred MacMurray. In fact the similarities between this and Absent Minded Professor and Son of Flubber are too obvious to be missed.Still those were two pretty funny films and Blackbeard's Ghost is in a great tradition. Dean Jones is the new track coach at Godolphin College and he stays at the inn that's run by the descendents of the crew of none other than Edward Teach better known as Blackbeard. But they are a harmless bunch of senior citizens led by Elsa Lanchester. Yet that inn is coveted by gangster Joby Baker who's bought the mortgage. Jones finds a faded piece of paper in an old bedwarmer and it's a spell that makes the ghost of old Blackbeard visible to him only. After that Jones plays straight man to a hilarious Ustinov. Blackbeard and is doings cause some romantic problems for Jones with Suzanne Pleshette, but in Disney tradition in the end the old buccaneer sets everything to right and escapes the limbo he's consigned to.For Peter Ustinov fans, this is a must. You can see it in his face and his performance how much of a good time Ustinov was having with this part. It will translate into your enjoyment as well."

338,tt0062737,1,"I saw this movie on Easter Monday this year, I loved it, it has so many great jokes, mostly ghost jokes which were great.One of the most funniest movie, I have seen, I could not stop laughing.Blackbeard's Inn, a small hotel on the Carolina coast, is run by the Daughters of the Buccaneers, a group of little old ladies all claiming to be descendants of the notorious Edward Teach, known as Blackbeard. When Steve Walker. The new track coach for Godolphin College, registers at the inn, he learns that the Daughters are desperately trying to pay off their mortgage in order to prevent a takeover by the local gambling czar, Silky Seymour. Encouraged by Jo Anne Baker, a college instructor, Steve helps the old ladies' cause by buying an antique bed warmer at a charity auction and discovers that it was once owned by Blackbeard's 10th wife. Before being burned as a witch, she had condemned her philandering husband to wander in limbo until he performed one good deed. By accident, Steve conjures up the devilish pirate's spirit and persuades him to help the Daughters.After that he life is being turn upside down by this ghost, it some very funny scenes, then people starting to thinking that Steve is the one who is going crazy.Great comedy for the whole family."
339,tt0062737,1,"I loved this move as a kid, and it aged very well.My wife and I watched it today, and I laughed at several parts.Peter Ustinov was brilliant."
340,tt0062737,8,"This Ustinov performance is one of the few I saw of him. The amazing ease and wit with which he performs is admirable. Who would have thought that a classic role such as a pirate could be filled in with such dignity. The story itself is a patchwork of silly situations all centring around the fund raising for a group of old ladies. The whole cast is up for a good laugh (I suspect Ustinov has something to do with this) and this gives the movie some swagger. The sets and effect used in the movie are amateurish, BUT this is what makes the movie all the more gullible. Although this might at first seem a movie to be seen on TV on a rainy Saturday afternoon, I recommend you go to the videostore and enjoy it on a Friday night before you go out."
356,tt0356910,7,"I saw an advance screening of this movie tonight, and I must say it far exceeded my expectations! Of course, due to the stars involved I knew there'd be sex appeal. And due to the advertising I knew there'd be plenty of stuff ""gettin' blowed up real good."" But what I wasn't expecting was the tongue in cheek jokes, dark humor, and respectable plot twist! Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie will only fuel rumors of their relationship with their performances - their chemistry on screen is scintillating, to say the least. The allure of each actor as an individual is undeniable, but when they're together, whether getting busy or getting pummeled, the screen fairly sizzles. It's a popcorn, Hollywood movie, of course, and you'll have to get past the fact that the two leads are the only two among many professional killers who seem to be decent shots! But the action is kickin, the acting well above par, the leads luminous, the plot is lots of fun, and the laughs are plenty. Enjoy! I sure did..."
341,tt0062737,8,"The new Godolphin College track coach, Steve Walker, spends his first night in town at Blackbeard's Inn where he inadvertently summons the ghost of Blackbeard. Blackbeard is cursed to roam through limbo, making life miserable for Walker in the process, unless he can do one good deed to send him on his way to the other side. Helping Godolphin win the big track meet (and saving the Inn in the process) might just be the good deed he needs.The 60s and early 70s were a prime-time for live action Disney movies like Blackbeard's Ghost. These were good, clean, family films with real actors, real stories, and real comedy. I hadn't seen it in years and maybe it's a nostalgia thing for me, but I found it just as entertaining and fun as ever. A lot of the comedy may be the obvious slapstick type, but it works nonetheless. The entire track meet is a hoot. I suppose my favorite bit may have been the baton pass mix-up during the relay race. Pretty funny stuff. The acting in Blackbeard's Ghost is first rate. Ustinov is very good as Blackbeard. His overacting is exactly what the role calls for. Everyman Dean Jones and the stunning Suzanne Pleshette make the perfect Disney couple. You can't help but root for them. Finally, Elsa Lanchester steals every scene she appears in. A couple of times I found her laugh-out-loud funny. It's a nice cast. Throw in the rousing, very Disney-esque Heart of Oak pirate sing-a-long and you've got a winner.I doubt a movie like Blackbeard's Ghost would be made today. Ustinov doesn't come close to the image Disney's promoting these days. Too bad, because today's kids and families are missing out.8/10"
342,tt0062737,1,"Peter Ustinov was one of the great comic actors. Between his skill at creating well voiced characters and his comedic flair, a number of films that he has performed in are just hysterical.Dean Jones is silly and neurotic. Susanne Pleshette is, as always, a harridan. The rest of the cast do their job as comic relief in the old disney fashion.I know that it is far too late to pull it off, but there should have been a sequel. ""Silky's Revenge"". Silky returns to his life of miscreancy after a six month term in the county jail, determined to settle a score with the entire original cast.One must remember, Blackbeard was not exorcised, he was merely set free. When Silky threatens his friends and family, he returns and foils Silky's ill-advised plot to cause mayhem in any way he can."
343,tt0063341,8,"I came across this one while organizing videos my family had taped-I was about to take it out when this started playing. I figured I'd watch a few minutes, see what it was all about, and finish labeling the tapes. Long story short, the project was set aside for another day, and ""Never a Dull Moment"" became a family favorite! This is a Disney movie from the '60's, and as such represents some of Disney's best, before the days of formulaic family movies. It's not really aimed at children; the story is dialogue-driven, and the lead character's predicament is presented through dramatic irony. Younger viewers may not get it. That all makes it sound heavy, but it's actually incredibly funny. Three major aspects of comedy: physical/slapstick, situational, and verbal. All three are present and woven together in a way that certainly held my attention. I can't speak for everyone, but the title rings true for me, over and over! The acting is solid all around. Dick Van Dyke steals the show as Jack Albany, an actor mistaken for renowned hit man Ace Williams (played by Jack Elam). Van Dyke is at his comedic best. Presumptious Florian (Tony Bill), having never seen Ace, makes the mistake, forcing Jack into a situation where his survival depends on his acting. On some level this movie pokes fun at the typical mob story. You have the boss, the tough guy, the inept guy, the pro pickpocket, the driver, the dumb broad, and the kid. The actors play their stereotyped parts well, highlights being Tony Bill and Joanna Moore. This may be the best role Tony Bill ever played-his other roles just seem flat in comparison to this punk, who changes from a creepy armed henchman to a whining, flinching doormat depending on how much trouble he's in. Bill has, however, become a successful producer/director. Edward G. Robinson seems to relish playing Joe Smooth, a powerful, art-loving mob boss who may be losing it a bit mentally. Dorothy Provine is good, also, as Smooth's art teacher, but my biggest beef with the movie is the part of the script where she explains her connection to the boss. It works, but it could have been better.Overall I recommend this movie. It's no cinematic triumph, but it is good, clean fun, and it is very funny! Most parents are probably aware, but for those that aren't, the ratings system has changed since the '60's. This one was G in that time period, when smoking was commonplace and violence in the movies wasn't the issue that it is in the 21st century. Not that one era is better than another (I honestly can't fathom why Ice Age and Over the Hedge are PG movies), but this one has some PG material by today's standards. An engaging story with lots of laughs!"
344,tt0063341,8,"This movie, starring the gifted actor, Dick Van Dyke, is an unsullied comedy full of humor and plot. Creative scenes flow in this film with a unique twist on classic situations. Though it is an older film, it surpasses most films hitting theaters today in acting and storyline. Jack displays courage and wit without losing the ""just the average guy"" way about him. Sincere facial expressions by Dick Van Dyke, and strong comedic timing sell this story from beginning to end. You will finish this movie feeling like you have stepped into ""Jack's"" shoes and gone on this escapade with him. With a touch of action, romance, suspense, and a delightful twist, this comedy is well worth your time."
345,tt0063341,7,"Having grown up in the sixties, and having an older brother willing to take me to see the latest Disney movie, I'm surprised I never saw this one. Though it's from the late sixties, and the plot by today's standards is overdone and predicable, it's still a fun one to watch. Edward G. Robinson plays a tough mob boss, and has a gang of familiar character actors making up his mob: Mickey Shaughnessy, Henry Silva, Slim Pickens, to name a couple,who are out to steal a famous painting in order to create the heist so history will remember Robinson's character, Joe Smooth. Along comes Dick Van Dyke, mistaken for the ultimate killer, Ace Williams. A ""B"" actor, Van Dyke's character Jack manages to pull off the role. Throw in a captive art teacher, a sequence with Jack Elam as the real Ace Williams, and a hilarious chase in an art museum, and you've got an entertaining 99 minute film. Rated G, it's a family show, but watch it to enjoy Dick Van Dyke. He lends his talents admirably and shows why he remains one our funniest actors that came to grace both TV and the film industry. Classic Disney and Dick Van Dyke--you can't go wrong with that combo."
346,tt0063341,6,"Although the movie is saved by Dick Van Dyke and Edward G. Robinson, it is not nearly as entertaining as ""A Thrill a Minute With Jack Albany"" (original book title). The movie brought on smiles whereas the book had me laughing out loud. If you haven't seen the movie or read the book, watch the movie first. The hilarity will quadruple from the screen to the page. {Best that way instead of the reverse) If you plan on enjoying only one, then take the book over the film. An excellent job of converting what was written to the cinema. Dick Van Dyke was Jack Albany. No one else could come to mind when picturing the character. But I'm a sucker for most of Van Dyke's stuff. He's best playing some form of Rob Petrie, from Bye Bye Birdie to Some Kind of Nut."
347,tt0063341,1,"Great movie.... genuinely funny throughout....cool story and great cast
Hoping this comes out on Blu-ray at some point. Nothing offensive, just great fun."
348,tt0063341,6,"Never A Dull Moment provided Hollywood icon Edward G. Robinson with the opportunity to do things. Add a Walt Disney movie to his list of screen credits and allow him to do a film about his passionate avocation, that of art collector.Robinson combines it with the last of gangster roles, that of Leo Joseph Smooth, both gangster and art collector. Robinson is pretty much retired from the day to day business of running a criminal enterprise, kind of like Vito Corleone only he's pulling himself back in for one last go.He has it mind to own a large mural that is being shipped to the United States for exhibit so he's going to steal it. With that in mind he hires a whole lot of his old gang back plus a couple of extra hands.Which is where Dick Van Dyke comes in. For reasons I cannot fathom, Tony Bill mistakes actor Dick Van Dyke with hoodlum Jack Elam. To save his life Van Dyke goes along with the mistake for almost the entire run of the film as he's taken to Robinson's well guarded home. Van Dyke calls on all his acting skills to convince Robinson and his whole gang he's really a hoodlum.Fortunately for him he meets up with Dorothy Provine who's an art teacher that Robinson hired to improve him culturally. The two of them have a whale of a time trying to get out before the caper comes off.Never A Dull Moment has a few good laughs and also in Disney studio's tradition at that time, employs a nice range of film character actors who were finding less and less work as the studios were putting out less and less product for the big screen.It does rest however on the weak premise that Dick Van Dyke could possibly be mistaken for Jack Elam. In that it's weak indeed."
357,tt0356910,7,"I find it quite hard to..i don't know..analyse this movie.On one hand this could be a masterpiece, with the swirling clever cinematography and the obvious chemistry between Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt (as they hitched up in real life during the filming). But, on the other hand, this is a stupid film, just an action flick, trying to be emotional and meaningful but turned out trying to be a blockbuster.I hope you see what i mean. I have rated this film 7, because of the reasons above, as the clever cinematography mixed with some good fun comedy and watchable action can't be that harmless can it. Can it? See for yourself."
349,tt0063341,9,"The plot is as follows: Jack Albany --comic actor who ironically usually plays heavies-- walks off the set of stereotypical gangster TV movie still wearing his mobster outfit costume. He meets a young punk, named Florian, who confuses Jack for a hit man the former was expecting but has never seen. Jack calls upon his best acting skills to pretend to be the hit man (known only as Ace Williams). He and Florian hightail it back to cultured gangster Joe Smooth's mansion. There, while still pretending to be Ace, Jack learns of a Smooth-plot to steal a painting from the Manhatten Museum of Art the next day. ""Ace"" has the task of killing one or two Museum guards to make the theft possible. Jack makes the acquaintance of Smooth's comely female art instructor. A romance quickly develops between the two. To sum it all up Jack and the instructor then manage to foil the heist, get Smooth and all his henchmen arrested and the new couple live happily ever after (with Jack BTW getting favorable heist-foiling publicity which will undoubtedly help his acting career).Now to the misunderstanding part I wrote of in the title. This film is slightly dull--but on purpose. Ironic to its title. It is supposed to be about the difference between stereotypical-film gangster situations and real life gangsters. When the film opened up taking place on the set of a gangster movie the film Jack and the other actors are making looks all clichéd with a big, melodramatic shootout at the end of the story. There are no such theatrics when Jack is foiling the ""real"" gangster heist at the Museum --just a lot of talk and clumsy chasing and stumbling (perhaps more like it would really happen). The ""real"" gangsters are superbly drawn out (even to the point of some of them (like ""Cowboy"" Schaefer) possibly being slightly boring but hey they are supposed to be more like real life hoods and they aren't supposed to exist for just two hours to entertain us). In short, the misunderstanding was that no viewers who commented on here before seemed to realize it was all supposed to drag (once Jack leaves the movie set) in the name of realism. The realism is also heightened and contrasted by the very small, enclosed movie set Jack was on early versus the very large, ceiling-included mansion he later finds himself in while pretending to be Ace. Also, when the real Ace Williams actually later shows up he is wearing a then-modern 1960's two-piece business suit--contrasting sharply with the stereotyped gangster way Jack is dressed (see above). (What is wrong with Dick Van Dyke (Jack Albany) being mistaken for Jack Elam (the real Ace Williams)? Nobody in the film was supposed to know in the slightest what the authentic hit man looked like.)"
350,tt0063341,7,"'Never a Dull Moment' is worth watching, even if it could've been much greater.First and foremost, Dick Van Dyke is very good in the role of Jack Albany. The film does have issues, but none of them are to do directly with Van Dyke - if anything, he is the thing stopping this from being bad; well, he and Edward G. Robinson (Leo).The premise is decent, though the way it's portrayed is what cheapens the film in my eyes. It's more silly than serious, which probably works against it. The same story taken more proper would be way more enjoyable in my opinion, still with comedy in it but just with a sterner side to it.It drags a tad at the end, nevertheless it's still a production I like."
351,tt0063091,7,"an all family movie from the 60's If you were ever a horse crazy youngster and want to see a film with a bunch of beautiful horses and a Benji looking dog. here it is... although you will have it all figured out in advance, it is an entertaining, fun flick. all are happy, all ends well for everyone in this film. there is no downside unless you die from the sugar in it all. You will see a real young Kurt Russell as Dean Jones' daughters' boyfriend too,then you can check how he looks nowadays in his more mature adult roles, like Stargate etc. If you want to show your kids or grandkids a time when the hard facts of life were set aside in favor of some light entertainment and that all movies don't have portray ""real Life"" this is one of them. Disney was so good at bringing out fairy tales and just nice movies. Another thing i always liked was seeing events that do not occur anywhere around where i lived. Eastern style riding, the clothes, the events held and even the horses are alien to what we see out here in the western u.s. I am used to rodeos and quarter horses, and have yet to see an actual steeplechase, or sulky race or folks togged out for fox hunting. Even the jumping events that are in this show are not commonly found here in the rocky Mountains. So watching it is kind of extra fun, because it is not common here."
352,tt0356910,7,"It may be unfair to say, but its easily admitted that the most interesting ploy this film can rely on was the media storm surrounding ""THE affair"" that led to ""THE Hollywood couple to be"" Brangelina. As a matter of fact, the film is actually rather good and the playful yet genuine chemistry berween Pitt and Jolie excuses the ludicrous plot and reliance on marketing gimmicks. The film really isn't a serious one, but it is a sexy one."
353,tt0356910,8,This is a very funny movie. Brad Pitt is excellent as the frustrated Spy/Husband. Angelina Jolie is as beautiful as she can be and plays the role wonderfully. All very tongue in cheek and enjoyable to watch.
354,tt0356910,9,"This is a daaaamn fun movie! Heh. To all the critics, yes, there are a lot of explosions, gunfire, unrealistic battles, plenty of times where you think ""they MUST have been hit by a bullet by now..there is noo effin way..."", and over-dramatized violence, but there's plenty of good stuff too that should not be ignored.Probably the best part about this movie is the couple. I know it's been said before, but it's so true that I'm gonna repeat: Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie have incredible chemistry. It's no wonder they're still together today. Even when the movie couple, John and Jane Smith, where in their ""off period"" of marriage, you could feel something between the two. They are an amazing screen couple, they work incredibly well together. Their dialogue is just right...when one says something to the other, it's smooth and real. And of course, Pitt and Jolie are both extremely attractive, so they're fun to watch. Haha.The plot is all right..nothing extraordinary. It's a typical action movie plot, simple enough to leave plenty of room for the battle shots and violence. Nothing special. The dialogue wasn't bad, it wasn't lame action movie words. No stupid puns or anything. There was really nice cinematography, some shots that really were stunning. Usually the emotional aspect of action movies is dense and easy, cliché and boring, but I liked it in this movie. You could tell that they really loved each other, yet at the same time were committed to their jobs. You could feel the conflict.I own this movie and I'm glad I do. It's a good time. I recommend it."
355,tt0356910,7,"Since going through most recent action movies is like chewing through cardboard, Mr. and Mrs. Smith is pleasantly energetic for an action flick. Mr. Smith and Mrs. Smith is good fun, and does a decent job of satisfying the occasional need for summer-movies.The effectiveness of the film lies in the exploration of what happens to a failing marriage when the couple are at their wits end ... and ... for the first time, come to realize that the other is a professional assassin ... and ... subsequently push the ceiling on what is termed 'spousal abuse' ... and ... of course, get to play with guns.The success of the film, however, lies in how Jolie and Pitt actually bother to exercise some of their acting talent. They look like they are having fun, and genuinely enjoy the other (surprise! surprise!). The chemistry is good, and the actors are super sexy, which is always a plus for any film.The movie fails, naturally, when the ending summarily degenerates into what is expected of action-fare, the shootouts, gun battles, and kisses. Enjoyable, nonetheless, even on its final wonky legs.(Note: it is also a shame that in a film with so much shooting that no one gets to shoot Mr. Vince Vaughn. My, is that guy a terrible actor who can't resist hiding himself.)"
358,tt0356910,1,"My God, is everyone who reviews this movie here brain damaged? This movie's plot crosses the believability line halfway through the feature and never returns. I like action but I hate action that is this blatantly dumb. I thought movies like ""Sahara"" rewrote the dumb action book but this trash just adds too the new low.SPOILERS - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Why on earth did their respective agencies try and secretly set them up to face each other instead of just flat out eliminating them with bullets to the head at their offices? It's a good thing those agencies sent hit men by the dozens who couldn't shoot straight. This whole plot was extraordinarily dumb."
359,tt0356910,1,"Where do I start? It looked promising, it had Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt co-starring in this picture: what could do wrong? Praised as one of 2005 sleeper hits, I never got the chance to see this movie at the cinema, but last month I managed to rent a copy of this movie on DVD. I like action movies(especially the late 80's/early 90's movies), so naturally I was excited, 2 hours later I was sitting on my chair wandering what happened and thinking: were they talking about another movie? Did I see a different movie? For those who don't know, Mr and Mrs Smith is about a married couple whom both are hit men working for different hit men companies without suspecting each other's secret lives. The premise alone sounds far-fetched, but the start is bad we are «introduced» to the characters who are comfortably sitting on couches both talking to the therapist about their ever decreasing romance,I sensed that something was terribly wrong when by the end of that extended scene I was feeling sleepy and clueless. I had no idea who were these characters, nor did I care for them. Eventually after they find out about their secret lives after a failed hit, they try to take each other out, only in the end to find out that by telling the truth it makes their marriage jolt back. It's so sweet when they settle their differences that you almost forget they are both hit men and that they don't seemed troubled by the mere though that they both killed for a living, but yeah, their marriage was going down the drain so t doesn't matter if they kill for a living(I'm being sarcastic). Even with all the action I was bored out of my skull nor did I find any of the gags funny. And wow, the way Columbia is portrayed in the movie is an example of scriptwriters being dumb as heck, why didn't Angelina Jolie say anything about this, after she works for the UN and all? The major insult was after they made up, their companies put a bounty on them and decided to track them down and take them out, it's just too bad their aiming and their larger numbers couldn't compare to Brad and Angelina's super-human speed,resistance,agility and superior marksmanship. Did I mention I had no idea whom were they exactly figthing against? We never know who they work for nor who employed them? They just randomly pop out to fight them. Oh and don't get me started on the characters, watching Brad Pitt and Angelina on this movie is painful, they have no chemistry whatsoever, Brad mumbles all his lines and Angelina is a predictable tomboy stereotype and one-trick pony. Vince Vaughn's jokes all fall flat, and why is that actor called The Tank? I've seen pizza delivery boys with a scarier look.To call these characters ""comic book characters"", is an insult to them. But why Brad? Why Angelina? Arnold Scharznegger(who can't act) and Jamie Lee Curtis(who's hardly a sex symbol)did so much better in True Lies. In the end, the movie is boring, childish, unfunny and a waste of time, being nothing more then tabloid fodder for two over-hyped actors. Ranks as one of the worst actions movies out there, and I've seen xXx 2: State of the Union and Alone in the Dark. The rental cost me 1.5 and I would have felt cheated even if it was for free."
360,tt0356910,8,"John Smith and Jane Smith has the perfect marriage. Well, not quite so perfect. And they've been keeping secrets from each other. They work for rival firms that do outsourcing work for the CIA. (Sadly, this would be better if viewers didn't know this for the first twenty minutes of the film, but the previews already gave it away.) Based on the preview, I thought this would be a Pitt-Jolie lovefest. I have enjoyed many of Pitt's films but not so many of Jolie's. And together, it was like a showcase of perfection for the American masses. Do I need to be reminded I'll never be handsome or rich? (Some will say movies help us escape this, and maybe it does, but still...) My concerns were unfounded. This movie is well-acted, well-directed and well-written. The story is layered and brilliant, as well as quite funny. The direction fits well. The acting is superb, some of the best from Brad Pitt yet. And the explosions and gunfire and things breaking and high-tech gadgets? Very nice - someone put a lot into this film and/or has some natural talent I hope we see more of in Hollywood.I don't know if this film is PG-13 or R. I heard it was PG-13 because a sex scene was cut. Well, let me say: you should have kept the scene and kept the R. With all the excessive violence (really over the top) and the cussing, a little smut isn't going to make much difference. I mean, as an action film, I expect a solid R rating (look at Bruce Willis and ""Die Hard"" or ""Hostage"").No real complaints about this movie. I really want to say something bad, but I cannot. I was entertained the whole time and found the film very persuasively believable. I don't know who wrote or directed this (I guess I could check, but I didn't) but they just scored points in my book. Unless it was Michael Bay, but I'm pretty sure he had nothing to do with this."
361,tt0356910,4,"Cheesy story, boring as-if action that's been done a million times, what else can I say, just lame Hollywood garbage at its finest. I'm glad I got to see this for free, because it was really a waste of time. There is only one good part, and that is when Mr. Smith hits a guy in the head with a golf club. Other than than the movie does not offer anything more than a few shots of Lip Lady (Jolie) in fish nets for all the guys who think she is hot (c'mon, she really is just plain freakish with all that plastic surgery) and some shots of Brad Pitt with his shirt off for all the 14 year old girls who will probably go see this movie for that reason alone. This movie would have been better if they would have actually killed each other, and thus, brought the film to an end after about 40 minutes. I gave Mr. & Mrs. Smith a 4/10 because at least it was produced well and had some decent stunts and special fx, but other than that, I would say it is almost as bad the The Matrix 2 and 3."

363,tt8993398,8,"This show on the outset would appear to be another piece of weeb trash. And that's intentional, this shows title and cover are literally clickbait, and that's what drew me to the series, but what this show is, is something truly spectacular. Every single aspect about this show from its art to its plot are masterfully crafted to deliver the most emotionally powerful experice of any late 2018 anime. I cried multiple times throughout this series, and I am in no way ashamed to admit that. The characters and their relationships are very realistic and how they interact is just enjoyable to watch, especially with Mai and Sakuta, who have such amazing chemistry and play off the other exceptionally well. The other characters and the problems that afflict them are also explored in depth, with their problems being manifested into abilities or changes to them or their surroundings. This is manifestation is what the show calls ""adolescence/puberty syndrome,"" and its inclusion creates a small mystery element that gives the characters time to shine and truly express the issues plaguing them. It would also be cruel of me not to mention the amazing voicework done for this show, as all of it is excellent, same can be said of the art which is clean and beautifully shaded and colored. I completely, unironically adore this show, and the select few who I've made watch this show, shared my feelings. If you enjoy slice of life, mystery, romance, or anime at all, you owe it to yourself to watch this show."
364,tt8993398,1,"I'm bunching up the show and the movie. Holy Moly this is exactly what I've been looking for in a show, It takles insecurites and mental health in such a unique way. This is my all time favorite piece of media, I don't believe it's over but if it is I am very happy with the ending the movie gave us :)"
365,tt8993398,1,"Trust me, there is no minute in this anime will make you feel bored. The characters were likeable, there were a heartbreaking moments, the script was fantastic.it's a story for the people that you care about and love, with some science fiction, you have to check it out."
377,tt0065566,1,"""The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes"" is a very good film. Released by the Disney company in 1970 or so, it's a movie about a student who has all the knowledge, all the power, all the info - that made him as smart as one of those huuuuuge computers of the time!!!!! Hence, the name of the film is called ""The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes!""I've seen this original version not on the Old Disney Channel, but on a local station late one Saturday night in '97. It was good; I also remember the 1995 TV remake that I watched on ABC as were we moving here to Texas!Man, I wish I had all the knowledge like that boy did!!!!! Oops, this reminds me - I gotta quit writing reviews at the moment and finish writing my midterm paper - now!!!!!Before I go, let me say, enjoy this film!!!!!10/10"
527,tt0084783,8,"When I saw that Disney made this movie I was expecting it to be a toned down adaptation of S.E. Hinton's novel. Boy, I was wrong. This was one of Disney's more mature movies and had all the important stuff from the book. Even the drug deal that went wrong. The characters are just as likable as they were in the book which is good. It's too bad that this movie is forgotten. There was one review that called the movie version of That was Then... This is Now a gem and I would've agreed with that statement if it didn't have that crappy ending. This is the real gem out of all S.E. Hinton adaptations. If you ever find this movie somewhere, I recommend checking it out."
366,tt8993398,9,"This anime series is centred on Sakuta Azusagawa, a high school student. He has a bad reputation; people believe he was responsible for hospitalising three other students. He tries to live a quiet life but everything changes when he meets Mai Sakurajima, a teenage actress, at the library. There is something very strange; she is wearing a bunny girl costume but nobody appears to notice her; in fact she is surprised that he notices her. When he asks others about her nobody seems to recognise her name despite her fame. It appears that this is a case of what is dubbed 'Adolescence Syndrome'. Sakuta determines to investigate this. Over the course of the series he resolves Mai's problem but she isn't the only person affected; he must investigate other cases, including that of his younger sister who has been suffering from amnesia.I didn't expect too much of this anime but it turned out to be one of the best I watched this season. There is a solid sense of mystery as Sakuta tries to understand what caused each of the cases of Adolescence Syndrome and resolving it. Each case is quite different so it never feels repetitive. The characters are interesting; particularly Sakuta and Mai but the secondary characters are also fun to watch. The plot line involving his sister is particularly emotional. While to condition is obviously science fiction it gives an insight into relatively ordinary personal concerns. The animation was impressive with good character designs and backgrounds. Overall I'd definitely recommend this series.These comments are based on watching the series in Japanese with English subtitles."
367,tt8993398,1,"At the start you might feel confused because the writer has a weird way of introducing things but as you progressed and get comfortable with the idea of ""Puberty Syndrome"" Things starts to get really interesting. This anime has a very interesting turn off events to say the least. It is makes you laugh at the beginning and leaves you crying at the end."
368,tt8993398,1,"When I first stumbled upon this series, I avoided it because I thought it would be just another overhyped half-assed ecchi anime that everyone obsesses about. But no. I cried straight through the 4 first episodes. Maybe because of my low expectations from the start just made it the best anime I've ever seen!!"
369,tt8993398,1,"Amazing....I personally really like the anime
The concept of the anime is phenomenal
As a anime watcher I always want something new...
This anime was able to fill my stomach"
370,tt8993398,7,"First off, the art work is very nice, not spectacular, but very nice. The writing is intelligent. The story, or rather the sequence of story lines, is slice-of-life, quotidian except for the fantastic elements. It's high school kids striving to understand their adolescent conflicts. One of the big differences is, and one of the reasons I liked it is, the main boy character is not constantly struck dumb and impotent by social interactions, as is the usual case. He is cool and competent while at the same time aware that he is struggling for answers just like his peer group. He does his best without making a big deal out of it. He is not an agonized loner although he does tend to stand apart. Perhaps the sense of cool detachment is what induced boredom in some of the watchers."
371,tt8993398,1,It's an incredibly well written show with characters you can easily sympathize with. The chemistry between the characters is great and nothing feels forced. All the dialogues are believable and you can tell the writers made a conscious effort to minimize the amount of plotholes in the series.Recommended to anyone who is past their shonen/shojou phase of anime.
372,tt0065566,7,"I remember seeing this as a kid in the theatre, and saw it again for the first time in many years on cable recently. I was surprised how much I enjoyed it after all this time. Russell's performance is quite believable, despite the fantastic story line. Really good entertainment, and blows away much of the modern Disney entertainment provided these days, which is pretty nauseating."
373,tt0065566,6,"Squeaky-clean cut collegiate Kurt Russell (as Dexter Reilly) downloads data from his campus computer, and becomes a ""cause celebre"" by demonstrating his improved mental gymnastics. ""The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes"" continues the Disney studio's successful run of comedies featuring good-looking youngsters, great character actors, and a plot providing its star with a super-human strength. The first follow-up film had Mr. Russell discovering how to become invisible. Since it's a Disney film, the characters aren't too quick with the obvious (like the invisible hanging out in the girls' locker room), but everything is certainly likable.The film is chock full of familiar favorites, like veteran Cesar Romero (as A.J. Arno), Joe Flynn (from ""McHale's Navy""), and William Schallert (from ""The Patty Duke Show""). Getting to play in roommate Russell's top bunk is handsome blond Frank Webb (as Pete Oaks), who also joined Russell and Medfield College co-star Jon Provost (as Bradley) in the pages of ""16"" and ""Tiger Beat"". The teen magazines duly noted the presence of three of their own in one film. Mr. Provost had background fame as the second kid to own TV's ""Lassie"" and Mr. Webb ended his career tragically. Both feature prominently in the film's relatively fun conclusion.****** The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes (12/31/69) Robert Butler ~ Kurt Russell, Frank Webb, Cesar Romero, Jon Provost"
374,tt0065566,8,"This was the first movie I saw with Kurt Russell, and have been a fan of him ever since. His acting in this film, as well other Disney films he was in, shows young Kurt firmly grasping what it takes to be a good actor, and he continues to do so to this day.I saw this again recently, and its such a relief from some of the crap that Disney puts out now. Its a good example of good, clean family fun without the added bathroom jokes, etc., and for that reason I can see this might not appeal to kids today. But still, its a good, light-hearted comedy that'll still get a few laughs even today. Joseph McEveety provides a good story, and director Robert Butler executes it nicely. Joe Flynn and Cesar Romeo delivered some great performances, as did all the supporting cast."
375,tt0065566,1,"Add this to the list of great non-animated Disney movies and TV shows of the fifties and sixties (some others are ""Darbie O'Gill and the Little People,"" ""Follow Me, Boys,"" ""Spin and Marty,"" and ""The Hardy Boys."") This is wholesome, fun, family entertainment. But it's also witty, well-written and not overly sentimental. A nice slice of Americana at its best.Kurt Russell, so appealing as a child actor in ""Follow Me, Boys,"" returns to the screen as a nineteen-year-old (approximately) college student. His acting range is excellent, and he is accompanied by an able crew of supporting actors. Joe Flynn (who many will remember as the perpetually flustered captain in ""McHale's Navy"") is perfect as the dean of a private college that ranks low academically and in terms of financial resources in comparison to other colleges in the state -- especially the state university. Flynn -- in a sign of his college's limited resources -- drives what appears to be a Volkswagen Karman Ghia convertible. The driver's-side interior door latch is broken, so he simply uses a rope to keep it closed.He complains that the state university is rolling in taxpayer money that his private college can't lay its hands on, and rants and raves in a meeting of the college board of directors about the unfairness of that and about how the president of the state university is ""greedy."" The students overhear all of this through a bug they've planted in the dean's office. The dean, having declared that the school can't afford a computer that one of the professors wants, goes on to mention the names of some of the students he thinks should be put on academic probation.Hearing all of this, the students decide to try to get the computer themselves. What follows is a comedy of mishaps, misunderstandings and odd coincidences that is very entertaining. The overall theme -- that friendship is more important than money, fame and prestige -- is well supported by the plotting and character development in the movie.This movie, in my opinion, is worth watching more than once. Part of its charm is that the conception of what a computer was and could do was so different in 1969 than it is today.All in all, I highly recommend ""The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes."""
376,tt0065566,5,"Dean Higgins refuses to buy a computer and would rather suspend various students. Businessman A. J. Arno donates a computer but then withholds the yearly contribution of $20k. Student friendly Professor Quigley needs a part to repair the computer. Dexter Riley (Kurt Russell) uses the part and gets electrocuted. His brain turns into a computer and he becomes the smartest guy in the world. Unbeknownst to him, he also downloaded locations of Arno's crooked enterprises protected by the password Applejack.This is noteworthy for introducing Dexter Riley and his light Disney adventures. I prefer the second movie ""Now You See Him, Now You Don't"" much more. This is not that funny. The adventure is a little flat. A human computer could be more fun. Russell was a young rising star and his theatrical presence is quite magnetic. It was probably fun for kids back in the day but it has become dated."
378,tt0065482,7,"I saw Boatniks back in 1971 at the post theater in Fort Sam Houston, San Antonio, Texas and I remember talking a friend into seeing this. He wasn't keen on seeing a G rated family film. But he and I actually did enjoy it.The three heist men, Phil Silvers, Norman Fell, and Mickey Shaughnessy, steal the film. These three are a trio of the most inept crooks ever filmed. Graduating from the Three Stooges School of Crime, one scheme after another keeps blowing up for these three. They're so bad that on viewing it again after 34 years, my question is how did these three pull off the heist in the first place. Makes you wonder since the film opens with the heist having already been committed.Our hero isn't too much better. Robert Morse who made a sensational debut on Broadway in How To Succeed in Business Without Really Trying and later did the film, seemed to go nowhere after that. He gets the role Dean Jones usually played in those Disney films of that era, the klutzy hero who finally pulls it together in the last reel after one foul up after another. Stefanie Powers gets the Suzanne Pleshette part, the girl who falls for the klutz.In these Disney films there's always the hero's boss who is forever on Morse's case. Here that would be Don Ameche as the Coast Guard Commander at the Marina. As debonair and charming as he ever was back in his days at 20th Century Fox, Ameche is always a joy to watch.Boatniks is not a terribly pretentious movie, but it's good fun."
379,tt0065482,9,"This movie is not as far off-base as some may believe. Having served in the Coast Guard in the 80's (a little after this movie came out in 1970) it is not too hard to believe that many of the scenes could have really taken place (and still do in a lot of places).Sure, you'd surely be relieved of command for sinking a boat, but chill - it's a comedy, not a documentary.Anyway, Phil Silvers is marvelous and Norman Fell is so good in his deadpan role. Stephanie Powers is about as hot as she ever was and Don Ameche as the Base CO is perfect. And don't forget Wally Cox as Jason - I wish he had tied up near us! Don't expect too much from this lightweight, but rather sit back, maybe crack open a cold one (don't set it by your compass - of course cans were made of steel then) and just enjoy a far simpler time."
380,tt0067985,8,"I worked on The Wild Country as an electrician. The entire cast and crew was flown on a Boeing 737 non-stop from Burbank CA. We arrived about noon, and the elevation was high at Jackson Hole, but hot. It required a high speed landing and the plane went the full length of the runway and off the runway's end! EXCITING! Within 4 hours it rained, snowed with high winds, but by 5 PM it was clear! There was an airline strike while filming, and film as flown into Denver instead of Salt Lake City before going to L.A. for processing. It was unfamiliar territory for the plane crew, and several days of unexposed film were left on the runway. A plane ran over the film cans and exposed it, so we had to film it over...very expensive. During the summer, a garden was planted at the genuine 1800's log cabin (disassembled, and then reassembled at the movie location) and the vegetables looked beautiful. The fence around the garden was removed the night before filming the garden and the deer immediately ate the garden! Plastic radishes, carrots, etc. were flown in from L.A! I believe the Publicity Department (Ben Hartigan) said each vegetable cost $400! It was hot, and every fair haired person had sunburned lips. Two Dog (Frank DeKova supposedly had a wolf (real) and when we were filming his wolf, the wolf waded into the small pond near the cabin to cool off. The animal trainer waded in and got the wolf, and returned him to Two Dog. The camera rolled again, and again the wolf waded to the middle of the pond to cool down. (We were all hot). Again the animal wrangler waded into the pond so the wolf kept moving away from his trainer. The trainer ended up chasing him, and after an hour or so they were just dots on the horizon. It took the trainer 7 or 8 HOURS to chase the wolf to exhaustion and catch him, but he did...I don't remember if the wolf was used any more. Vera Miles attended church every Sunday (I think she was a Morman). 9 of the existing 21 Whooping Cranes were near where we were filming and about 10 AM every morning they got very noisy and took-off. It took them 100 yards or more the take off, first running and flapping their wings, then lifting their legs while their bodies stayed at the same elevation, and then slowly rising in flight...BEAUTIFUL! It interrupted our filming daily, but we were not allowed to disturb them in any way. It was said there were lots of fatalities of cranes because they ran into power lines and broke their necks. This was about as low as the whooping crane population ever got. They have since made somewhat of a recovery. Ron and Clint Howard were accompanied by their parents. Rance and his wife were among the NICEST people I have ever met...very quiet, but true friends. In Burbank they lived about 2 blocks from the Warner Brother's main gate. Rance had a study above his garage where he wrote. I urged him to give up writing (too unpredictable) and do something on production. I'm glad he didn't! He is a wonderful writer, and his son's have made great successes of themselves in show business. I continued working on movies and TV(started on My Fair Lady at Warner's in Crafts Service, worked on Mary Poppins etc. at Disney (yes, Walt knew many people by name and saw to it if you were in college, to provide employment so you could afford college). After Walt passed away, Disney changed dramatically, and became more like an uncaring factory. I got my degrees in Industrial Engineering and after 10 years at Lever Brothers, returned to the movie studios to do Crafts Service and Sound for 5 years on the A-Team (yes, I knew Mr. T and George Peppard),and the rest of the time in Crafts Service (2 years on Beverly Hills 90210, 7 years on NYPD Blue, 4 years on ER) (John Wells is a wonderful boss and a genius of a story teller), and am now working on a TV pilot, LAWMAN, as of November, 2009. Anyone wishing to get into movie and TV production may Email me for advice (I currently hold union cards in Crafts Service, Lighting, Sound, and SAG (Screen Actors Guild). The Wild Country was a wonderful experience and I hope your memories of the movie are as pleasant as mine were while working on it! David Collier dav_id@pacbell.net"
381,tt0067985,1,"All Cast and crew members were exceptional. Making a film takes team work. The crew on this film were the best of the best. Location Manager Austin Jewell & Auditor Nick Humphrey provided support and financial know how that made this an easy film to work on. Bob Totten, Director was a genius. Jack Elam was so good that you could almost smell him . Steve Forrest & Vera Miles turned in great acting performances. The Jackson Hole location with the Grand Teton mountains were a big hit with all, made the movie real. Rate this movie a 10 plus. Bob Clatworthy, Art director provided a artistic touch that rates at the top of the list. When we arrived in Jackson Hole in August 1969 and the Grand Teton mountains still had snow on them that lasted until we left. The town people of Jackson Hole were very nice and would help were ever they could. Many were hired as extras and rented vehicles and equipment to the production."
382,tt0067712,7,"This film started out pretty slow for me and probably for most who are used to quicker comedy prominent in other Disney movies of the time (such as Million Dollar Duck which was released a week after Scandalous John in 1971). But after the characters grew on me, particularly John & Paco, I found myself laughing out loud. I wasn't really pleased with some of the other actors, but they weren't so bad that they detracted from the overall film. Brian Keith makes it look fun to be a crazy old man. As the movie goes on, it gets better, so have a little patience if you're not used to this slightly slower style.""It's Lilac Tweed. A MAN'S cologne.""Haha!"
383,tt0069199,8,"The sad tale of a pair of cougars that mate and have cubs and a mountain sheep herder who witnesses the events and befriends them, only to be one day disrupted by a hunter on an expedition to make a kill: a cougar.Well shot and enjoyably written, this hidden gem from Disney shows the every day life and death struggles for a family of cougars on a direct path with death and changes in life. And when the death comes, you will know where a certain later Disney film death scene clearly got some of it's inspiration. And it's a heart breaker.If, like me, you are thinking this is sounds like a clear attempt to make hunters out to be evil people that kill lovable animals, don't worry -- it's not that kind of message, though certainly the tones are faintly there. It's more like described above.Almost like a documentary at times, this scenic eye candy (which would look wonderful in a quality remaster) is not entertaining just to look at, but is supplemented by a terrific orchestral by the late Buddy Baker, and there is a good deal of it to hear. The score shows us how to drive a scene, how to help it, that themes are okay and that experimentation in orchestra colors is not only interesting to hear, but it can heighten scenes. This would make a great DVD and an equally wonderful two or three CD set of score (if one day it should ever be released).What will become of the final mate and her cubs? Sit down and enjoy this to find out."
384,tt0069199,6,"One of Disney's better manufactured nature films, though 'Run, Cougar, Run' still has a lot of the same issues.I could probably copy and paste my review from their other films of this type and it would still suit. The main problem I have with these productions is that they lack true backbone, most of the time it's the obvious bad human, good animal plot which is too predictable; it's also difficult to connect to, of course we want the animal to 'win' but there's no other real reason to care.As noted at the top, it is one of the more improved ones. There's more to the cast for one, which is unusual. Alfonso Arau is charming as Etio, he's the only real good guy here; alongside Joe (Douglas Fowley), perhaps.The animals are (seemingly - still arguable I guess) more looked after too, which isn't always the case with these films. Despite that and Arau, this isn't a film that I found entertaining; though they've done worse."
385,tt0069291,1,"I am a 61 year old grandfather who is still a kid at heart. I still roar with laughter at the silly antics of the Roadrunner and Wiley Cayote. True, this movies is dated. All movies made in the 1970's are dated now, but this is such good clean fun that I would not hesitate to show this at a children's Sunday School class party. The ""surprises"" the family finds in unexpected places as they work to refurbish the hotel in time for the ski season; the fact that no one in the family skies; and the shenanigans they go through trying to get various jobs accomplished makes this movie a true comedy classic. In my opinion movie makers, in general, and Disney, in particular, have lost this sense of fun and it is a real shame. If you like this movie, I would also recommend ""The Million Dollar Duck"" and ""Black Beard's Ghost"" - also with Dean Jones - and also truly Disney Classics."
386,tt0070928,8,"This is one of the funniest film's of Disney's live action library. Taking another spin on the tale of Tarzan, The World's Greatest Athlete is the story of how college coach Sam Archer, tired of losing, tries to get away from it all by taking a trip to Africa.  While there, he encounters Nanu, a superhuman by any standards measured!!!  Seeing a gold mine and wins with Nanu as his athlete on campus, Coach Archer lures him to their university, where Nanu indeed excels in sports, but also feels homesick. Good jokes and tasteful humor make this a must-see.  Jon Amos and Tim Conway are great as the bumbling coaches, and Jan-Michael Vincent shows that he could act wonderfully within a comedic setting.  Also, this is one of the movies that displays Vincent's prowess, and makes people wonder what could have been.  While younger viewers may not know of Vincent, or wonder why anyone cares about a ""second rate actor"", there was a time when many movie fans felt that Vincent could have been a major box office draw.  While Nanu ultimately proves that he is a champion, Vincent will always make people ponder if he could have been a real Hollywood contender."
387,tt0070928,1,"Silly? You bet - and don't we love silly. A fish out of water? Most certainly - and aren't we all, at one time or another, a fish out of water. Loads of fun? Most definitely. The story line comes from the fertile imagination of someone impacted by Tarzan, but Tarzan was never this much fun. From Africa to America, covering a whole bunch of different types of people, including a tiger and a near-sighted landlady, The World's Greatest Athlete provides humor and a wonderful chance to relax. It gives you a happy chance to laugh at yourself and everyone else. The whole family will enjoy it. Our family found it a favorite when it first came out - and now that I am retired I still enjoy having a laugh at it now and then."

Those memories will be something I won't forget. To top it off, John Amos and Tim Conway also made a surprise visit to my parents, cousin, and Aunt's restaurant also located in Stockton, California. It was called ""Al Funzo's.It was a great evening for me, and my family, and the Restaurant patrons that came in that night.As for the movie, The World's Greatest Athlete"" was and still is excellent, and ranks high in my list of favorite movies."
389,tt0070928,7,"When Coach John Amos and his assistant Tim Conway go looking for athletic talent for Merryvale College, they say they'll travel anywhere. And in The World's Greatest Athlete they go to East Africa in search of a legendary jungle boy raised in the wild whose athletic prowess is beyond belief.The subject of their search is Jan-Michael Vincent who plays the young Tarzan like man and he's every inch the athlete that former Tarzans like Johnny Weissmuller, Glenn Morris, and Buster Crabbe were. They have to use a little trickery to get him out of the jungle and away from his foster father, witch doctor Roscoe Lee Browne. Browne knows all the jungle remedies, but he's lived in the world outside the Kenyan veld and he's up to its challenges.But he's still got concern for his foster son who ain't used to civilization and all the things that entails. Among which include women in the person of shapely Dayle Haddon who covers him on the academic end of things at college. Talk about remedial education though, this is really stretching it.She's also got a jealous suitor in Danny Goldman. Goldman's a little ferret of a schemer, the would be Iago sends for Browne from Kenya to work his voodoo magic to get Vincent back to the woodland wilds and a clear path for Goldman back to Haddon. If that means him losing the big NCAA track meet where Vincent is going to represent Maryvale in all events like Jim Thorpe did years ago for Carlisle, so be it.Jan-Michael Vincent looks just fabulous in a loin cloth. I'm surprised he never was cast in a straight out Tarzan film. He actually did appear in one years later when he was much older and the bad guy in that one. Of course he just had to utter ""Me Nanu.......You Jane"" to Haddon whose character name of course was Jane.Vincent and Haddon get great support from the whole cast, especially Tim Conway who has to deal with being shrunk to three inches in height by Browne in a bar. Conway gets a nice fifteen minute sequence trying to deal with his unfamiliar surroundings. Nancy Walker has a fine bit as a Mrs. Magoo landlady who can't recognize a tiger that Vincent has brought from Africa as a pet. He must have gotten him from the zoo in Mombasa because as most kids know, tigers aren't native to Africa.This was the final feature film appearance of Billy DeWolfe who plays the dean of the college and Goldman's uncle. I suspect he would have had more of a role had health permitted it.The World's Greatest Athlete is one of Disney's better screen comedies for the Seventies. And as we learn in the end, Jan-Michael Vincent might not just be The World's Greatest Athlete."
390,tt0070928,7,"""The World's Greatest Athlete"" stars John Amos (""Good Times""), Tim Conway (""The Carol Burnett Show""), and Jan-Michael Vincent (""Airwolf""). The plot follows Amos' college sports coach who is down on his luck. His leadership has not produced a winning team for his school; he is under threat of being fired if he doesn't find a way to turn the sports program around. On a vacation to Africa, he and Conway discover Nanu-- an orphaned Caucasian boy who was the son of missionaries, he was adopted by local villagers. He is a superb athlete, being able to outrun a gazelle. The coach sees his fortunes right in front of him,-but Nanu is uninterested in the Western world. So the coach concocts a scheme to trick Nanu into following him to America, where he promptly is enrolled as a student and made a star of the track and field program.
Will the coach's deception be revealed? Will Nanu find that he likes America and wants to stay? The under-rated character actor Roscoe Lee Browne plays a witchdoctor in a supporting role. Of curious interest is how the racial subtexts in the film were cleverly handled. By the early 70's, Disney studios was not known for casting African-Americans in prominent roles. The most obvious exception would be the still-controversial ""Song of the South"". Here, Amos is the ostensible lead, with Conway as the sidekick, instead of vice-versa. In another decade, the Nordic athlete Nanu might have been portrayed as being worshiped as a god by the villagers. Fortunately, the filmmakers bypass outdated notions of the ""white jungle king"" and portray Nanu as a young man satisfied with tribal life."
391,tt0070928,7,"If you are a fan of Jan Michael Vincent and would like to see him with very little threads on, this is the film for you! Yes, there's also a cute plot about a black football/baseball/basketball coach (John Amos) who travels to Africa on safari with his hopelessly stupid assistant (Tim Conway). While in Africa, they discover Nanu (Jan Michael Vincent)a young white African boy who possesses amazing athletic abilities. Nanu travels to the USA with the coach to excel in sports. Of course his witch-doctor adoptive father disapproves, and all sorts of goofy 70's effects ensue. JMV wouldn't be remembered for his acting in this movie, but his physique certainly got attention! He's slim and muscular, with long blond hair, and he looks perfect in the skimpy Tarzan outfits. But really, the star of this film is the TIGER! You never see this in movies today - a real, live, full-size tiger wrestling with the leading actor! With his teeth around JMV's neck, no less!! Can you imagine? One false move, and CRUNCH! Dead actor! Wow. I was amazed. JMV cuddles and rolls around with this Tiger throughout the movie. It's awesome. Move on over Russell Crowe - Jan Michael Vincent takes on real tigers, not CGI ones!!!"
392,tt0070928,6,"This is a fish out of water story in which coach John Amos and sidekick Tim Conway find a young jungle man and figure he'd be a great athlete if he were taken to civilization to compete in athletic competitions. So they give it a try. Like many Disney films from the early 1970s, it's loaded with silly humor and contrived sentiment, yet there is a certain charm that may endear it to the younger members of its audience."
393,tt0069866,6,"Charley And The Angel was the final film that Fred MacMurray did for the Walt Disney Studio. It was certainly a profitable association for both Disney and MacMurray although this one does not come anywhere near such things as The Absent Minded Professor or The Shaggy Dog.MacMurray as Charley Appleby is a workaholic just tending to business at the hardware store day after day and ignoring his family which includes wife Cloris Leachman and kids, Kathleen Cody, Vincent Van Patten, and Scott Kolden. Kathleen's got a pair of boyfriends interested in her in Kurt Russell and Ed Begley, Jr. And the boys are getting themselves into mischief.MacMurray after a couple of close shaves gets a visit from guardian angel Harry Morgan who says because of those things, he's fouled up the celestial schedule.

I don't think it was an accident that Fred's last three films with Disney were all set in the past. Disney's current star of modern type comedies was the all American Kurt Russell.The younger brothers innocent involvement with gangsters was something of a hoot however. I'm surprised Vincent Van Patten didn't go on to do more Disney items, he seemed perfect as a Magic Kingdom type.Harry Morgan is a droll sort of angel who gets to do a bit of scenery chewing with MacMurray. He's easily the best one in the film.Fans of Fred MacMurray should appreciate this."
394,tt0069866,1,"This is an excellent family film and I disagree with the previous reviewer. I think Fred MacMurray was an expert at playing the father on television and I don't think this movie is any exception. He was just perfect for the part and really fathers can be any age. This is also a movie with a good message about making the best of your relationships while you have the chance, giving quality time and not just ""providing"" for your family. The father in the movie is very absorbed with providing for his family, but has forgotten what is most important. His children & wife are growing away from him and he doesn't even know it. It takes an angel to help him ""wake up"" and to give him that 2nd chance to start over. Excellent and I hope it is released on DVD soon."
395,tt0069866,5,"Fred MacMurray and Cloris Leachman live in a Depression-era small country town. He has his own store and through a succession of mishaps and bad luck, he feels everything's against him. He finds his own sons idolizing another friend's father instead of himself, because he never does anything with him. Then he meets an angel, Henry Morgan, who says Fred has cheated death several times and that his end is only a matter of days, any time now. Unless he changes his money-loving ways and think of his family and real quick, he won't be here much longer. From such a serious and somewhat depressing beginning to a silly end, as the boys get a job, one not that up-and-up, (of course they're oblivious to what they're doing,) because they want to help the family out. The law goes after the mafia, which of course has something to with this questionable job of theirs. They all get thrown in this silly discombobulation of an ending. I wanted to like this movie, but it gets uneven and nonsensical by the end of it. It has its charming moments, but they are few and far between. The funniest thing is when Cloris thinks Fred has lost it, because he's talking to himself, when he's talking to the angel she can't see. If you love Fred MacMurray's Disney films, watch ""The Absent-Minded Professor"" and leave ""Charley"" to his own devices."
396,tt0069866,1,"i suppose if you wanted to be gutsy or perverse about this you might suggest that this film has a religious element. personally i think that's a stretch, but i once read a review in a Christian monitor claiming the 'Oh God' movies with George Burns were good Christianity in film. oh okay. if that's the case i suppose you could make a similar argument here, if you so choose to go there.to be perfectly honest and open about this, i consider myself to be a serious Christian, but i don't prescribe to any superstitious or medieval beliefs. i consider myself to be somewhat of a realist and try to be as practical about serious matters as i can be. most of our common beliefs about Heaven and angels are based on medieval artwork and superstitious notions. the whole ""guardian angel"" idea also seems like some corny contrivance out of nostalgic Hollywood movies like ""It's A Wonderful Life"" or ""The Bishop's Wife"". i've never really been into movies like that. i guess i always felt they were more my parent's thing.Disney's 'Charley and the Angel' manages to be a Disney comedy of substance without being too preachy about a message. older Disney films seldom were because Disney did't believe in burdening his audience with anything too thought provoking. 'Charley and the Angel' manages to be poignant and offer good and correct insights into life without sacrificing it's usual formula of fun and humour to convey it's message. i doubt most viewers will even realize there was much said when the film is over.this movie is also outright hilarious. it's almost ""get away from me with that"" kind of funny. there is a outrageous subplot concerning Charley's two little boys driving a automobile and running bootleg alcohol for gangsters. all a little questionable since the boys are only twelve and ten. WHOA. what was Disney thinking?! that's bound to unnerve any uptight parent concerned about wholesome content. fortunately the whole thing doesn't get too out of hand and remains within the confines of ""G"" rated entertainment. a wacky car chase with tommyguns doesn't help though, it just fuels the crazy, over the top giddiness of the events. this film has got to have one of the funniest depictions of children in film ever. Charlie's two boys, Willie and Rupert, provide most of the humour here and come off as red blooded, all-boy types rather than namby pamby sweetie pie child actor types. the subplot of Willie and Rupert running bootleg whiskey after Charley tells them to stop being lazy freeloaders and get jobs (keep in mind the boys are only twelve and ten), is probably some of funniest and most off the wall humour concerning children i've ever seen in the movies.the acting here is also amongst Disney's best in a live action feature. this was Fred MacMurray's last film for Disney and it's a great reminder of why his fans love him so much. MacMurray was a wonderfully subtle actor, something he didn't get a chance to show on his routine sitcom 'My Three Sons'. MacMurray makes Charley seem believable and a realistic focal point for the film. Cloris Leachman is just great and gives a equally realistic performance that helps to keep the whole film somewhat grounded and convincing. Harry Morgan was one of Disney film's best assets in the seventies. his performance also gives the angel a earthly humanness which is needed since the angel almost always appears with FX effects and gag imagery. Morgan gives the angel a feeling of normality which dilutes a lot of the eerie surrealism of the character. and any film that stars Vincent Van Patten is uber cool in my book. i mean hey, Vince VP was in 'Rock n' Roll High Skool' with the Ramonees. there is also a kiddie junior version of Kurt Russell here looking no older than a baby faced nineteen or twenty.this film is a good American history lesson as well. it's depiction of life in America's great depression of the 1930's is effective and accurate. particularly a scene where the bank closes it doors on it's depositors. my grandparents told stories of that one. of course there's the whole Willie, Rupert and the prohibition thing.look. i happen to be a Christian but i'm no prophet or psychic. i don't know what the afterlife is supposed to entail or what a seraphim is to look like. i know that most of our notions are based on superstition and medieval artwork. i don't think this movie is attempting any kind of literal interpretation.it's said ""that a good man cannot be unhappy or a unhappy man do good"". don't know much about that. but i do know that Charley's destiny seems fairly ambivalent about him and his fate. that is until he reaches his ""self discovery"". i don't claim to know if tomorrow brings rain or sunshine, but most people should RELAX and not worry about money or worldly things to the point you forget the promises life can hold for you. this has got to be one of my very favorite Disney films. and one of my film favorites period."
397,tt0955308,6,"I had very high expectations and who wouldn't? Ridley Scott directing a great adventure with a very solid cast and a high budget.The movie didn't really start the way I thought it would. The pace was quite slow but very interesting, and I was gripped. The interaction between Robin and his fellow soldiers was quite believable and entertaining, and the story about the English crown succession was also nicely done.The entire chapter about Nottingham and its citizens is also at a nice and slow pace, but its never dull. Von sydow is a pleasure to see as usual, and both Crowe and Cate Blanchett delivers. You just sit and smile, when things suddenly goes very very wrong...It starts when Walter Loxley explains Robins past to him. The scene is rushed and it seems a bit far-fetched. Also the following scene when robin goes to the meeting of the barons. Ridley must at this time peeked at his watch and noticed that he let most of the movie pass without telling much, and start to massacre the script.The Nottingham action scene is where it's starting to go seriously wrong. You can't really get to understand how Robin suddenly is in command of an army, and speaking to lords as their equal. Especially when they call him by his common name in a scene later. The pace is really off here too... Action scene-Action scene-Short grief scene- Love scene- And on horseback against the French again in a 5min gap. Set in contrast to the feelgood mode you were in this is a very rude awakening.After this you are handed a fighting scene that is absurd in every way. The landing craft is from WW2 (what possible use does the landing bridge have on these boats?). The battle is a slaughter, the French never stand a chance(not very interesting). When suddenly Marion appears on the beach with the local teenage runaways on ponies I just shake my head... why?! It's just stupid?! Also they seem to be trained by ninjas and easily takes on trained French soldiers.There is an ending after, but its thrown together in five minutes.In one line.This movie had a lot of potential, but it's thrown away on hasted parts and plain stupid scenes."
398,tt0955308,3,"I went to see Robin Hood with an open mind. I didn't read any of the reviews, I didn't watch any of the previews, and early on I thought that it was a pretty good film with a few loose ends that would surely be wrapped up by the ending. I was wrong. Nothing got wrapped up and there were so many plot holes and loose ends that left this movie a disaster of a film. Here are just a few examples:1) Who are the kids in the forest with The Strangers masks on their faces? 2) What happened to Prince John's first wife? We see her looking through a keyhole at her husband in bed with another woman but that's it. John tells his mother that he has written to the pope seeking an annulment but his mother tells him that it will never be granted. So happened to her? 3) Early on, the priest who is leaving Nottingham to deliver the grain tells Marion Loxley that she can't have the grain because ""she reaps what she sows."" What did Marion Loxley, other than conveniently leaving all her grain in a storage shed outside the main walls, do to deserve this ""reap what you sow"" punishment? 4) Robin comes to Nottingham and schemes with the Loxley's to pretend to be Robert Loxley who has been gone for 10 years. No one in the village catches on so we are to believe that EVERYONE in Nottingham either a) are new to Nottingham and didn't know Robert Loxley before he left or b) conveniently forgot what Robert Loxley looked like? 5) Robin tells us that his motivation for returning to England is to seek land and fortune. He's there to take advantage of the situation. Marion Loxley has him sleeping on the floor with dogs and they have no apparent relationship other than keeping up with the scheme that Robin is Robert Loxley. Why then does Robin go out of his way and risk life and fortune to help Marion get her grain back?6) Robin gets the grain back and we see a small group of them casually tossing the grain around on the ground. When Marion Loxley wakes from her afternoon nap Robin tells her that her fields have been planted all 5,000 acres?? 7) If you want to remember forgotten things from your childhood all you have to do is close your eyes and vivid flashbacks will suddenly appear. 8) The French had landing craft Saving Private Ryan style in the 12th century? 9) We see an army of horsemen riding fast through the mountains to get to the beach to meet the French landing craft. Before they go down to the beach they decide the horsemen will ride to the beach and foot archers will fire from the cliff side. What archers? In the battle scene we see thousands of arrows striking down the French on the beach? Where did they come from because they obviously didn't ride in with the horsemen? Did they fly in on helicopters? 10) Before the battle on the beach against the French I thought, ""This is going to be a slaughter."" It was. That is supposed to be interesting how? 11) Where is England's standing army? You know the tens of thousands of men in red uniforms with swords, bows and arrows, cavalry, pikes, and all that shiny equipment like we saw in the movie Braveheart? 12) We see Prince John an arrogant young man with a mistress in his bed early in the movie, then he confidently fires William Marshal and sets Godfrey off to the north with an army to collect taxes. Then when civil war ""unexpectedly"" sets off Godfrey is suddenly ""not the friend that he thought he was"" and John seeks to unify the angry mob because England conveniently doesn't have a standing army. Robin interrupts the meeting, gives a little speech, and they all ride off to war together. Then before the beach battle scene we see that John is useless because although he is suppose to be leading the army he doesn't know how to place the troops and instead relies on William Marshal to make a battle plan. In the battle we see that John is just a bumbling idiot, swinging his sword around randomly even after the battle is over. But in the VERY next scene we see that John is confident again, going against his word to sign the charter and declaring Robin to be an outlaw. Will the real King John please stand up? 13) Somehow on the battle on the beach, even though they were just fighting victoriously along side one another, we are supposed to believe that King John is jealous of Robin because the French surrendered to him? King John asks William Marshal, ""Who did the French surrender to?"" and William Marshal points to Robin. The thing is, it seemed to me that the French didn't surrender to anyone. The King of France ordered his boat to turn around so they could ""fight another day"". Was the whole ""they surrendered to Robin"" just thrown in to move the plot along? 14) How did King John determine that Robin was lying about his identity?15) What is the motivation for the kids with The Strangers masks on their faces? Early on they are evil looking thieves who steal the grain from Marion Loxley but by the end of the movie they are little ninja warriors on ponies fighting not just alongside Marion, but being led by her."
399,tt0955308,1,"Okay, here is he awful truth:1. Apparently a Stone Mason wrote the Magna Carter (Robin's Father) 2. Although a humble archer, Robin within a matter of weeks becomes the King's right hand man in battle 3. Apparently in 13th century England, the French had 20th Century warefare technology 4. Apparently French soldiers can row their way across the channel in canoes and then jump out and fight(although earlier in the film the channel is so perilous that a big English boat barely makes it across and it took overnight to cross) 5. King John never signed the Magna Carter 6. Russell Crowe can do a number of English accents - unfortunately, he just couldn't choose one 7. Cate Blanchett is very good at channelling Katherine Hepburn 8. Apparently Marion is psychic because she recognises the man who killed her father-in-law in battle without having ever laid eyes on her 9. Marion although having worked on a farm in Nottingham for 10 years is a skilled soldier and killed wield an axe better than most of the French and British soldiers 10. Everyone in the town of Nottingham is so stupid that they don't realise that Robin is impersonating Robert of Loxley who is about 20 years his senior, blonde and looks nothing like Russell Crowe. Don't see it - it's not worth your coin. I'm so disappointed because I love Cate Blanchett and Crowe is usually very good. But this is just bad story telling."
400,tt0955308,1,"Robin Hood was an Outlaw in England. The idea that Robin Hood followed King Richard in the Crusades is from the Sean Connery movie ""Robin and Marion"". Robin and Marion was made in the cynical 1970's. Robin and Marion is not a movie that gets watched a lot (I wouldn't sit through it again) and it's theme didn't need to get expanded in to a two hour epic. The traditional Robin Hood takes place in England for it is the story of the British People Saxon's vs the Norman occupiers. Green is the symbolic color of the native people of Briton (e.g. Gawain and the Green Knight). The traditional Robin Hood of legend wore green for he is part of the pagan history of Briton, not some cynical inner city trendy who wears black. There is this idea that people in the past wore depressing clothing and were dirty all the time. Yet if you look at the paintings from the time of King Richard the first you will find that people wore bright colors. Only bums dress badly in any age.If Christian Bale, Cary Elwes, Jeremy Irons, Johnny Depp, Robert Downey Jr. or Kevin Kline had played the part of Robin Hood we could have expected a more extensive range of emotions and with a better English accent. But Crowe has a limited range of emotions. Emotionally Crowe only does the self-serving stuff very well, you know; angry, self pity, prolonged contempt etc. Crowe is also very good at being ""intense"" which accounts for his screen presents and is often mistaken for acting ability. But the emotions required to do ""The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood"" are way, way beyond him. Being jovial, generous, good natured, romantic or even nice are outside his ability.In the Errol Flynn version, Robin Hood is bested by Little John and comes up laughing at himself at having been beaten by another man. This sort of self-demeaning humor and good will are way off the chart for Crowe. Crowe doesn't do humble. The character of Robin Hood had to be retooled to be more like the Gladiator so that Crowe could play the part. So Robin Hood the cunning fox had to be changed to become Robin Longstrides the bossy grumpy bear.Crowe can't do love or Romance very well. In Gladiator they had to cut love scenes out of the script. Crowe can only really do 'intense needy love' or 'self-pity mercy love' but not Romantic Love. To make matters worse Crowe hasn't held onto his youthful good looks in the ten years he's been a star he's really aged badly. Tom Cruse has been a star for almost 30 years still has his looks. As does Brad Pitt. Kevin Beacon who has been in the business for almost 35 years still has his looks. But because Crowe has let himself go so badly the part of Maid Marion had to be drastically retooled as well. The first Maid Marion Sienna Miller was fired from the movie because she looked too young and thin next to the aging and hefty Crowe.The movie was shut down for two months and the part of Maid Marion was changed and rewritten to that of an older woman. Maid Marion became the Widow Marion (Cate Blanchett) and the romance became a marriage of convenience. Crowe can't do romance. Gone are the scenes where Errol Flynn and Olivia De Havillandand flirted playfully on screen. The unromantic Crowe doesn't flirt well and can't woo. His on screen romances have always been rewritten around this so that the woman does most of the work while he looks angry, confused and full of self-pity. In this case Crowe's Robin Hood doesn't really like Marion (anger) he's just doing a friend a favor by sharing her bed. It's hard to believe that Robin Hood spent 10 years in the army with surrounded by men and isn't attacked to Marion. But Crowe can't play ""attracted"" there's no self pity in it."
401,tt0955308,8,"This is not exactly Robin and his merry men, nor is this Errol Flynn swashbuckling and laughing his way through merry old England as he gets his jollies battling the sheriff of Nottingham. No, this particular take on the story of Robin Hood is very different - like none you've ever seen before. Even the historical setting is changed from what's usually offered. Here, rather than waiting out the evil regency of Prince John and his minions until King Richard returns from the Crusades, Richard is already dead. His death comes very early on in the movie in battle in France. John is the King of England in this movie, and rather than an unselfish ""robbing the rich to give to the poor"" type character, Robin (actually in this movie Robin Longstride, who finds himself impersonating Robert of Locksley and becomes known as ""Robin of the Hood"") is a more complex character. I wouldn't say exactly noble - especially in the beginning - and his battle is not so much for the poor as it's a battle for the ""rights"" of the English people, as he eventually takes on what seems to be the fight to get John to sign what I assume is Magna Carta, and at least temporarily has to ally himself with John to help lead the defence of England against a French invasion.The different historical setting is a bit disorienting to be honest - especially at first - but it also gives a degree of unpredictability to what's going to happen, and once you get a sense of where you are, when you are and what the fight is about it's easy enough to understand what's going on. Russell Crowe did a commendable job, I thought, in this alternate portrayal of Robin, and Cate Blanchett was most certainly a different kind of Marion. She's not the Maid Marion of legend. She's tough, she's a fighter, she goes into battle with the French - although not leading the battle, there's almost a Joan of Arc quality to her (minus the voice of God.) I was quite taken with Oscar Isaac as King John. He took the part and made it real. John came across as I would expect him to from the historical record - shifty and conniving, untrustworthy, quite willing to make and break whatever alliances are necessary at any given moment to ensure his survival as King and sometimes quite befuddled by his responsibilities. Perhaps a weakness was the fact that there was no real focus on Robin's men. Really only Will Scarlett (played by Scott Grimes) and Friar Tuck (played by Mark Addy) were significant elements in the story, and even they weren't particularly important.The sets and setting were good. This felt like I imagine England in the late 12th-early 13th centuries would have felt like. Rough, brutal, dirty. It worked for me. The battle scenes (and there are a lot of them) are very well done. Since the movie ends with the caption ""And so the legend begins"" one wonders if a sequel might be in the works, perhaps detailing the struggle leading up to the actually signing of Magna Carta? If so, I'd definitely watch it. This was quite good! (8/10)"
451,tt0076618,1,"The Rescuers is absolute classic Disney from 1977. Telling the tale of two mice from the Rescue Aid Society who set out to rescue little orphan Penny who has been held prisoner by evil Madame Medusa. Easily of the best Disney animations since 1967's The Jungle Book and not surpassed, in my opinion until 1989's The Little Mermaid. With some great comedy moments and touching moments too, especially the beautiful song 'Someone's Waiting For You' sung by Penny as she loses faith in ever being rescued. Watch out for the great character 'Evinrude' the dragonfly, brilliant. It's no wonder this was my late mother's favourite Disney movie. I would seriously recommend it to anyone"
402,tt0955308,1,"I really resent having to pay money to watch a second rate prequel.Didn't anyone from the studio see the final cut before release? What were they thinking about? Come on guys, a little historical research (even for a fantasy film like this) wouldn't have done any harm.This movie was a collection of nonsense from start to finish. OK, Robin Hood is a character from fiction and story tellers are at liberty to use this character as they wish but surely some historical context or realism are necessary to allow the suspension of belief? The French landing did not happen.Magna Carta is an important part of our history and should not be messed around like this.Don't get me started on the geographical screw-ups. Do the film makers have any idea how far it is from Nottingham to the South Coast? Or where the White Horse is? Idiots.But it is only a movie and I have been happy to sit through other films that have mangled history to a worse extent than this, so what was wrong? EVERYTHING! The script, the absence of plot, ludicrous casting, bizarre accents, poor lighting and cinematography, inaudible dialogue (thanks), unexplained background characters and hours and hours and hours of nothing happening all add up to a momentous car crash of a movie.Did I mention it was derivative? It stole the best parts of the Robin Hood legend, Saving Private Ryan, the Disney animated classic and Braveheart and wasted them.Do not waste your time on this or the inevitable sequel."
403,tt0955308,1,"God almighty! This Robin Hood is catastrophic, period. On top of that, the lack of humbleness reaches the unthinkable. I've heard Russell Crowe , the new Robin Hood, referring to Errol Flynn's version as crap. Crap? Can you imagine! Errol Flynn made that movie ""The Adventures Of Robin Hood"" in 1939 and people still watch it today, 77 years later, with utter delight. Russell Crowe's ""Robin Hood"" was made only 7 years ago and it's already forgotten. I was appalled by his comment and realized that Oscar winner or not, wisdom or knowledge is not part of the equation. I've heard Russell Crowe in a different interview saying he never trained as an actor. He claims he doesn't know anything about Stanislavski and more importantly, he doesn't care to know. What a message to send to the new generations."
404,tt0955308,5,"""To be hunted all the days of his life, until his corpse unburied, is carrion for foxes and crows.""A few tips for getting the most enjoyment possible out of Robin Hood:1. Forget that it's an adaptation of Robin Hood, entirely. Just pretend like it's a middling medieval drama/adventure movie starring Russell Crowe and Cate Blanchett (who's spectacularly underused), with some very vague connections to the Robin Hood legend. Everything is changed about, added too, and embellished beyond recognition. There's nothing wrong with trying to put a fresh spin on an old tale (if it works), but you'll be greatly disappointed if you expect any more than loose connections to the well-known versions of the adventures of Robin Hood and his Merry Men. 2. Don't expect Gladiator in England. Robin Hood desperately tries to be epic, sweeping, grandiose, and politically involving, but it doesn't come near the heights of the mega-popular, critically beloved Gladiator. It's not a bad movie, and you could enjoy it (if you keep your expectations at a reasonable level), but it's okay at best and deeply flawed at worst. Crowe doesn't put half the heart, passion, or effort into Robin Longstride that he did into Maximus. The characters are one-note and static, and the plot is overly-ambitious and needlessly complex. There is less than zero chemistry between Crowe and Blanchett. Robin's back-story was a contrived mess that added nothing to the movie except empty minutes to the running time. The main flaw with Robin Hood is that it's so preoccupied with being serious and deep, that it forgets to be fun. There's nothing wrong with trying to take a story like this in a more realistic direction, but there needs to be a rousing adventure at its heart. That's what's missing from this film. Robin Hood is a shadow of Gladiator. It's a shadow of Kingdom of Heaven, to be honest. But there are moments when the battles are raging and you forget that this is supposed to be Robin Hood, when it's an okay movie. My review seems horribly negative and that's not my intention - my expectations for this were just really high. It felt like Ridley Scott really didn't try all that hard, and the cast and crew followed his example."
405,tt0955308,7,"Solid is the keyword. From the screenplay, to the cinematography and the performance, the film is based on solid grounding. Indeed, we couldn't imagine less from the people assembled on the project. And the first signs are indeed good, starting as an origin story that traces Robin's steps returning from the Crusades and arriving in Nottingham. The plot is immediately both compelling and fresh with regards to the well known tale.The first problem we run into is that the film never allows itself to linger. This creates two problems: the sense of purpose it reaches for through urgency has a tendency to be lost to aimlessness, and the characters never have the space to generate real depth of emotion.Imagine only this: Russel Crowe, Cate Blanchett and William Hurt together have collected three Oscars, and an additional nine nominations. Yet it it's hard to lavish praise on their performances, because they never manage to inspire empathy as well as we might wish. The sense of urgency - of imminent physical danger to their person, of the crucial importance of their quest - never quite strikes home.The screenplay doesn't always help them. It attempts to give the tale a strong moral foundation, by associating it with burgeoning democratic ideals in feudal Britain, unconvincingly: suspension of disbelief failed this reviewer.For both these reasons, the epic sense of greatness that saturates Mr. Scott's similar works never works in this one. Indeed, in the anticipated climax of the battle, slow motion shots fall flat, and emotion never reaches an expected high, in spite of the film's competence in the action scenes.This is a work that strangely echoes others, as well. People will be drawn to comparisons with Gladiator; these aren't particularly relevant beyond Russell Crow's similar (yet less engaging) performance. Rather, Robin's journey from the crusades and through England, in which he prospers on fateful luck and earned respect, copies Ridley Scott's own Kingdom of Heaven. In their themes and ambition these three films are alike, but Robin Hood doesn't thrive from the comparison. Where flaws are shared, what made the other two great is oddly lacking in this latest historical epic from the director."
406,tt0955308,2,"It's one of those films that was annoying me as I watched it but actually making me cringe the more i think about it. A few points - ignoring any historical inaccuracies (of which there are plenty).1) There appeared to be only one character (Godfrey) who could speak English intelligibly, accents of Robin Hood and Little John were quite laughable (Crowe darted between North Yorkshire, Liverpool and Ireland) and I have no idea which part of the world Little John was supposed to come from. 2) Maid Marion – a very hammy performance and legend does not ever mention her super-human strength; have you ever tried to bend a modern longbow replica? Very hard even for a large bloke and they have about half the draw weight of the real thing, and I had no idea that Wendy and the lost boys were involved in the legend of Robin Hood. 3) The final battle scene was taken more or less directly from Saving Private Ryan and included replica landing craft, one of the daftest scenes in cinema for quite some time. 4) There is so much information about concerning archer's other weapons of that era there was no need to invent a long sledge hammer 5) Why call the film Robin Hood? Only the last few seconds are to do with 'Robin of the Hood' so this should have been clearly labelled as a prequel. 6) Could they not have found a beach with real cliffs?All that money wasted – they could have made a decent film"

Intentionally so. How else could a movie about a ""living"" car turn out? Helen Hayes is charming. Stephanie Powers is spunky. Keenan Wynn is almost perfect in his role as the over-the-top Disney villain. OK - the flashbacks to Herbie's racing career are too long.

The film took me through intrigue, joy, pathos, anger, heartbreak and laughter - not necessarily in that order. I cried an awful lot! Great film and if it doesn't touch you then you have no soul."

410,tt0071199,8,This is one of those tattered movies you pick up from the Family 50 cent racks.  Surprisingly good movie.  Music by John Denver and good performance from Chief Dan George.  Also serves as a gentle introduction to concerns about the environment and native issues for younger folks. Strength of the movie is the story-line.
411,tt0071199,6,"When a likable young white man (Patrick Wayne) moves up to the Canadian outback, he finds the natives not so welcoming and wonders why. He makes easier friends of the three abandoned bear cubs after one of the nastier Indians kills the mother. The cubs stick to him like oatmeal on a newly painted wall, even though he has every intention of releasing them into the wild once they are old enough and trained to take care of themselves. He falls in love with them as if they were household pets. But baby bears aren't really puppies, and the Indian leader (Chief Dan George) warns him that their land will be plagued with tragedy until all the bears are released into the wild.It takes a couple of misadventures for Wayne and the bears (mostly quite harmless and entertaining) until he is able to make them ready to accept living as bears should. The sight of one of the poor cubs being pushed down the snowy mountain (by another one of the cubs) in a sled as Wayne chases after him on skis unfortunately without poles is a comedy delight. The conflict explodes when Wayne learns that the parks department (lead by veteran character actor Andrew Duggan) wants the Indians to move off the land so they can develop it for a tourist attraction. The Indians, lead by George, hold fast, and tragedy as he predicted does break out. This is pleasant family fair, as Disney succeeded in adventure stories more than comedies."
412,tt0071199,9,"Much like the films of the 1960s, The Bears and I has that same nostalgia feeling. Later films wouldn't feel the same. The narration adds to the value in my opinion. Very similar to Charlie the Lonesome Cougar in a few ways. Patrick Wayne was great as Bob Leslie, the man who fosters the bears.I suppose you have to be a fan of the Disney narrative to truly enjoy this picture. Only a true loyal fan can see that this isn't a bad movie. It's what we've come to expect from Disney of the time period, family oriented stories with a touch of class and heart."
413,tt0071199,5,"Patrick Wayne heads out to an Indian settlement to speak to Chief Dan George; Wayne had been a buddy of the Chief's son, killed in Vietnam. Wayne wants time to think about his life, so he holes up in a cabin. There he succors three orphaned bear cubs and gets in the middle of a squabble between the US Parks Department and the Indians. The Parks Department wants the land for a national park, and the Indians look on it as their home.It's a good movie in terms of story and camerawork. The area around Chiko Lake in British Columbia, standing in for US wilderness, is beautiful, and the performers -- including the three bears -- are good-looking and move well. Where the film falls down is in the dialogue direction. Wayne drones, and the voice-over he performs, written by Jack Speirs, is annoyingly cute. The story movies which voice-over narration improves are very rare. Usually they are a kludge to fix a problem that should not exist. In this one, with its year-long story, the narration helps tighten the movie. Even so, there's too much of it and poorly performed."
414,tt0071288,7,"Having been to Hawaii and actually going through the famous Parker ranch on the big island, I'm in a better position to comment on this film now than before.The Castaway Cowboy is one of two films James Garner made for the Disney studio in the Seventies. He's a Texas cowboy who got himself shanghaied in San Francisco and jumped ship and washed ashore on Kaui. Right into the arms of widow Vera Miles and her son Eric Shea who are struggling to make a living as farmers. A lot of wild cattle keep trampling up their crops. So Garner gets the idea that they ought to start cattle ranching instead. Of course the Hawaiian farm hands don't readily take to the American cowboy culture. Of course they eventually do in the end.Cattle came to Hawaii courtesy of British explorer George Vancouver who left them on the big island. It was the descendants of those cattle with which John Parker founded his ranch. No doubt some of them made it to the smaller islands in the chain.Of course there's a villain in the piece and it's Robert Culp. He's a banker with eyes to grab Vera Miles land and maybe Vera herself. Culp does resist the tendency to model his performance on Snidely Whiplash and he's a worthy rival of the resourceful Garner.Of course there are paternalistic attitudes towards the native Hawaiians. But if you want to see a serious film about those attitudes than watch the film made of James Michener's novel Hawaii. This is a Disney family product and doesn't pretend to be social commentary.The Castaway Cowboy is a good entertainment. How could it be anything else with James Garner starring."
481,tt0077698,1,"I seen this movie at the movie theater when I was a little girl....it is one of my first memories of being at the movies.....and I loved it....very funny with little life lessons along the way..after all these years I never forgot hot lead and cold feet...I even remember the theme song...""hot lead and cold feet..may the best man win...hot lead and cold feet..may the best man win.."" dadadada....What stands out in this movie is the performance of the lead character playing both parts of the gunfighter twin and the mild mannered twin...I think that kids today need to rediscover this movie....it should be remembered as a family classic...I cannot wait to purchase this on DVD and you should to especially if you have young children...."
415,tt0071288,6,"It has the benefit of being one of the most Kauai-intensive movies ever filmed.  Not only was 90% of the movie actually made on that beautiful Hawaiian island, but it's actually SET there, too -- and there are very few movies both shot AND set in Hawaii.The photography is excellent; the score is very good (but would have been better with a little more island influence), and the use of the Kauai locations, though limited to just a few, is first-rate.  Garner is fine, and Culp makes a good, if foggily-motivated, villain.However, the attitude toward the Hawaiians is painfully paternalistic, and there's a stupid, TRULY stupid, subplot involving ""sorcery"" and some extremely improbable caves, full of Tahitian statuary.  Very bad idea.Historically, it's a bit muddled; much is made of the idea that no one has found a way to load cattle aboard a schooner at this time.  (Somewhere around 1870, I guess.)   But over on the Big Island, this problem had been licked, and the founder of the Parker Ranch was already getting rich selling King Kamehameha's ""big dogs.If the script had been better, with a less predictable story, THE CASTAWAY COWBOY could have been a little gem.  As it is, it's mostly a pretty time-passer."
416,tt0072951,8,"It always puzzles me how adults can review movies that were meant for a young audience and review it negatively (through adult eyes), completely forgetting about a child's unique and innocent perspective on the film. Shame on them all!!As a young kid in the 70's, Disney, cartoons and sports were all weekly staples- so many good memories!! Escape to Witch Mountain was one of the first movies I saw in the theater, and was both entertaining and fun. A good adult cast; Donald Pleasence, Ray Milland and the underrated Eddie Albert, all provide good support for our two hero kids who use their powers to not only try to find home again but thwart the evil intentions of those trying to use their powers for their own benefit. The movie is well paced and has the usual hi jinks one expects in a ""chase"" film. I enjoyed it then and liked it just as much after a recent viewing on cable.This movie also illustrates how one doesn't need bad language or crude behavior/jokes to appeal to kids. What some people regard as ""corny"" others find a refreshing change from today's standards of ""acceptable"" programming."
417,tt0072951,7,"I was thrilled to see one of my favourite films, as a child, released on to DVD.  I can now share some of my childhood with my own kids.  No big surprise, but my older daughter (7) loves it.  My younger daughter (2) thought some parts were ""scary daddy""; the broom/jail scene was well done! Highly recommend it as a family film for folks that want a nice movie to watch with their kids."
418,tt0072696,7,"Taking the best bits from it's vast library of charmingly entertaining nature films, Disney assembles an awfully hard to resist film, even if it's all quite familiar. From North America, to South America, to Africa, and even the Arctic, there are loads of cute animals from Disney's fourteen ""True-Life Adventures"" short-subject film series, narrated by frequent Disney voice-over artist Winston Hibler (who was also a writer on ""Sleeping Beauty,"" ""Cinderella,"" ""Peter Pan,"" and ""Alice in Wonderland""). This documentary includes the infamous lemmings mass suicide segment, which was actually staged and in reality is a complete myth (lemmings do not blindly kill themselves every few years as a result of overpopulation). It's fascinating how such a falsehood can become an accepted truth. It's even more fascinating when you can clearly trace an urban legend back to it's source, but I digress. Overall, if you've enjoyed other Disney nature films, you'll enjoy this one, even if it's a best-of compilations that's all quite familiar."
419,tt0072696,6,"This is a compilation of the series of award-winning Disney nature documentaries in the 50s and 60s. They're a little before my time but I still remember some of them either on rerun or playing in grade school. By 1975, they are a bit dated but still very compelling nature photography. I would recommend watching the original episodes instead of this best-of movie. The varying animals and habitats make this somewhat disjointed. There is also some hero worship with the narration about Walt Disney. Of course, the narration is of its times and the animals are humanized. This is fine but for historical and aesthetic reasons, the individual episodes are the more important films."
420,tt0072696,6,"It's a selection of clips from the first dozen years of Disney's documentaries, from the Oscar-winning SEAL ISLAND to JUNGLE CAT, narrated by by Winston Hibbler.It has a lot of great nature photography, but it lacks the focus of the individual entries of the series, which concentrated on a single environment, and thus offered a unified message -- even though camera trickery might be used to mock up an anthropomorphic story. This attempts to offer an overview of the series as stemming from Walt's love of animals, with clips from animated films, and Disney's linking sequences from his tv show with live animals. The result is a ninety-minute introduction to the series that may well serve someone who is unfamiliar with the individual movies, but not to some one who has seen them."
421,tt0074968,1,This film is full of fun and comedy. You are going to laugh so hard you'll hurt! The building ledge and police chase scenes are outrageously hilarious! Don Knotts does a great job in this movie.  Definitely one of his best!
422,tt0074968,1,"I have been watching this for longer than any other movie, over 25 years now, ever since I was a little kid. I have probably seen it hundreds of times, and yet to this day it still remains one of my favorites. It's very fun and clean comedy, more movies should be like this. Some of it is a bit crazy, like the long car chase, but it's also truly hilarious and great comedy that to me doesn't grow old. I also really like the story which is rather unique. It's great in the way that two would be criminals actually become very good people. I find it quite touching how they get to having a good time with the kids, and what they do near the end to help them. And it's got a very happy and satisfying ending. It's great fun, great comedy, and after all these years it's still one of my favorites."
423,tt0074968,4,"Maybe if Walt Disney Studios had decided to make a real adaption of O'Henry's Ransom Of Red Chief the results might have come out better. Certainly the story had been used before most successfully by 20th Century Fox in their O'Henry anthology film O'Henry's Full House where Fred Allen and Oscar Levant played the luckless kidnappers of Lee Aaker. But this adaption, credited or not, in No Deposit, No Return is one of the Magic Kingdom's less successful family films.I have no doubt that originally this was intended for Don Knotts to be once again teamed up with Tim Conway. If that had happened maybe the results would have been better. On the other hand you could believe Darren McGavin was a top professional safe-cracker a lot faster than Conway.Brother and sister Brad Savage and Kim Richards are on Easter break from their boarding school in the United Kingdom and instead of being with their absentee mother Barbara Feldon, they are going to be spending time with their stuffy grandfather David Niven in Los Angeles. That's a terrific disappointment because Niven's just not a kid's person.So after ditching chauffeur Bob Hastings sent to pick them up and falling in with crooks McGavin and Knotts, the kids hatch a scheme to stage their own kidnapping in the hopes of raising plane fare to Hong Kong where mom is and for their two accomplices to get out of a mounting gambling debt owed to Vic Tayback.Kids under the age of 12 might approve of this film. Every adult in the film is positively clueless, including cops Herschel Bernardi and Charles Martin Smith. Having kids be the smartest ones in a film is always guaranteed to please a juvenile audience. But you've got to wonder how Bernardi and Smith ever got on the force and how McGavin, Knotts, and Tayback ever succeeded in a life of crime. As for David Niven this was one of two films he made for the Magic Kingdom, the other being Candleshoe. That one being set in England took advantage of Niven's background. In No Deposit, No Return, Niven's considerable charm is stretched to the breaking point.Recommended strictly for grade school kids. I'm sure William Sidney Porter is glad he wasn't given any screen credit for this."
424,tt0074968,7,"Darren ""Kolchak"" McGavin and Don Knotts make a comfortable comedy team in this typically over the top, slapstick-heavy live action feature from Disney. Kim Richards and Brad Savage, no strangers to Disney movies, play Tracy and Jay, and the two of them feel neglected by their jet-setting mother Carolyn (Barbara Feldon). And they definitely don't want to spend time with their grandfather (David Niven), whom they don't really like. So they enter into an arrangement with Duke (McGavin) and Bert (Knotts) after the two adults and two kids share a fateful cab ride. Tracy comes up with the idea that they will stage a ""kidnapping"", and when rich grandpa supposedly coughs up the dough, the four characters will split the proceeds. Grandpa, however, has other ideas.One would think that screenwriter Dale Launer, who later wrote ""Ruthless People"", had seen this one and was inspired by it. This is a reasonably engaging family comedy that unfortunately wastes too much time and goes on too long (the story didn't really need that detour where Bert must rescue Jay and his pet skunk Duster). Still, it's easy enough to like, with the whole cast delivering very enthusiastic performances. Since Duke and Bert are basically good guys who would like to go straight, the movie does still need a genuine villain, and gets it in the form of threatening mobster Big Joe (Vic ""Mel"" Tayback) and his flunky Freddie (character actor Louis Guss).Like so many Disney live action comedies from this era, the climactic action revolves around a farcical chase sequence. It does feature some priceless gags, but goes on too long, just like the overall movie. It's formulaic stuff, with the kind of feel-good ending guaranteed to please its intended audience, and has some of the characters experience epiphanies so they can become better people by the conclusion.Keep an eye out for a rich variety of familiar faces in supporting roles and bits: Herschel Bernardi, Charles Martin Smith (as apparently the worst driver on the police force), John Williams, James Hong, Bob Hastings, and Iris Adrian.Inspired by the O. Henry yarn ""Ransom of Red Chief"".Seven out of 10."
425,tt0074968,7,"I didn't enjoy a movie this much for quite some time. Brains off, laughter on, push play and enjoy. Many brag about it being unrealistic. Damn, people, this is Disney comedy for kids. It is not supposed to be realistic, it is supposed to be fun and it's very successful in it. For almost two hours I was elementary school boy once again, just relaxing after school and watching good old-fashioned TV. I have no objections to this movie, except maybe car chase scene being too long. I recommend it to everyone with all my heart.7/10"

A comic Disney movie that proves that crime may not pay, but it can be funny."
427,tt0074968,7,"If Disney had their way in this world, It would be the world as it portrayed in this film:*Mom works for a magazine. I think she's divorced, though the word divorce isn't mentioned.*She has two kids, Jay & Tracy.*Now, Mom is detained in Hong Kong during their Easter vacation.(Any one ever heard of Easter vacation, or did I miss something when I was growing up in the seventies?)*The kids have a skunk as a pet!!(It's unthinkable that a child of any age would want a skunk as a pet) I forgot-this is not the real world! This is after all the world according to Disney.*Jay utters the words ""If mom can't bring her vacation to us, we'll take ours to her"" But Tracy is realistic. She says ""Where do we get the $1200 to pay for the two airline tickets?"" Yea right! In the real world, this is unthinkable! But don't forget-this is not the real world.*Two men try to rob a safe at an airport, they get away of course-not successful in their attempt to get the money. The two kids get in the same cab as the two robbers at the same time! They go to their hide out. They own a garage, and they are building high rises on both sides of it. Is this for real? It must be according to Disney!*The Grandfather sees the two kids go inside the hideout with the robbers, but he doesn't call the police Instead he want to teach the children how to be better citizens. Do grandfathers let their grandchildren go inside a hideout with a couple of robbers? They do at least According to Disney!*Try this: Two gangsters are after Duke & Bert, because they owe them $7000.00. $9000.00? $11.000? $13.000? They failed at their airport robbery, now they have 72 hours to get the money. What to do? Tracy has an idea: Stage a kidnapping, have grandfather pay the ransom who is a millionaire. Let's see if I get this straight: Grandfather wants to teach the children to be better citizens only to get a ransom note from the so called ""kidnappers""? I guess this is normal according to Disney.*After sometime, grandfather calls the police. Mom hears about the ""Kidnapping"" and she returns................I could go on, but that would give it away! You get the picture? I know this is only a movie-but it's interesting to note a contrast between the real world and the world according to Disney. The events depicted are unthinkable and unrealistic.Where do script writers get the ideas for this trash? I have no idea, but I do know this: They have a perverted view of the world. I enjoy this film though. Just don't forget: It's not the real world, but the world according to Disney!"
428,tt0074968,1,"What more could you ask for from Disney, their formula comedy films were a staple from the 1950s through the 70s. In this film, two children are supposed to spend their vacation with their grandfather. Problem is, they don't like him, so they concoct a plan to be kidnapped. The kidnappers couldn't have been better cast with Darren McGavin and Don Knotts. This film couldn't be made in today's world, with all the child abductions going on, but back in 70s though, the atmosphere was different. The point of the movie though, is money is not what loves you back, and the grandfather needed to learn that. This is one of the last Disney films to star Don Knotts."
429,tt0074968,2,"In this silly, pie-in-the-face comedy, a brother and sister try to avoid spending Easter break with their stuffy grandfather, so they hide out with two bank robbers and fake their own kidnapping. You don't have to rent it; trust me, it sounds better than it is.While he gets first billing, David Niven as the grandfather has hardly any screen time. The children aren't the most likable characters ever written, and the wannabe criminals, Darren McGavin and Don Knotts, aren't really that funny. For laughs, screenwriters Arthur Alsberg and Don Nelson rely on slapstick gags and elaborate but boring setups involving the little boy's pet skunk. It's fine to rent with very little children, but the grown-ups will probably be surfing the internet on their phones the whole time."
430,tt0074968,6,"in this sort of caper comedy,Darren McGavin and Don Knotss star as a safe cracker and his partner/lookout/getaway driver.both are softhearted and eventually get mixed up in a(sort of)kidnap scheme with a young girl and her brother(who happen to have a penchant for mischief).anyway,the usual hi jinx take place.there's some physical comedy and some silly car chases.there's also some pretty bad overacting.but that's seems par for the course in a lot of Disney comedies form the seventies.it's all mildly amusing for the most part and it's entertainment the whole family can enjoy.for me,No Deposit,No Return is a 6/10"
431,tt0075347,8,"I first watched this movie when I was about 7 or 8 and I watched it over and over again it was so good. I wish I could see it again, but the DVD is still very hard to come by. The movie deals with a young boy and his companion who are forced to flee from their home in search of a treasure. Jim and Ben end up meeting lots of different people who can help them along the way, but they also have a lot of things happen to them that either slows them down or simply gets in their way, but none the less it's a very entertaining movie and has a good plot to it. It's a good show to see as a kid or even adult if you like stories that entail treasure hunting. It actually has a good story to it unlike some movies today that are just filled with special effects. So if you want to see a good old fashioned treasure hunting flick then you have found it."
432,tt0074599,7,"I saw this movie at theater when I was 6. I made my dad take me at least 3 times because I could not get enough of it. The Supermarket scene is definitely the best scene in the whole film. I always got scared when Tom Bosley fell into the tank of lobsters because it looks so painful when he limps off down the isle with the lobsters hanging off his pants. Overall, this is a fun movie with lots of slapstick. To this day, I still remember the word that was used to get Gus to kick the ball: ""Oyage!!"" The live-action Disney film is a lost treasure and they just don't make them anymore like they did back in the 60's and 70's."
433,tt0322330,9,"I've been wanting to see this film since the trailers started playing many moons ago. I saw the Jody Foster version when it first came out in 1976 and like that one, the 2003 version is an excellent all ages movie. It reminds me of the great flicks Disney use to release all the time during the 60's and 70's so it was no surprise they reached to the vault to redo ""Freaky Friday"".Jamie Lee Curtis has her best comedy role since ""A Fish Called Wanda"". She was having fun with the part and many of the teen mannerisms she did as Annabell were dead on. Curtis is one of the most underrated actors in the world. Just based on her performance ""Freaky Friday"" was a great ride.Lindsay Lohan made the movie better with her take on Annabell. I have liked Lohan since ""The Parent Trap"" and if she decides to stay with acting she might go on as long as Jody Foster has in the business. Lohan has one thing that actors like Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts have and that is an expressive face. Acting is so much better when the actor can add to their part through the expressions in their face and Lindsay can do that.Watching the movie was a delight for me. I never got the feeling that 35 year old men wrote the script (they didn't) like I do with some of the ""teen"" movies out today.The music used by the movie band ""Pink Slip"" was above average and the other soundtrack music fit the film as well.Now if they would just do a big budget ""Herbie the Love Bug"" feature, I would be even more happy."
482,tt0077698,8,"Much of the movie is not very realistic, some of it's rather crazy, especially the constant shooting, fighting and destruction. They are constantly shooting, but not hitting each other. They're also constantly getting knocked out or injured, but are completely normal again shortly after wards. But it's entertaining and a lot of fun, they must have gone through a lot of work and money to achieve all this. The acting is pretty good, and rather funny. It's impressive that Jim Dale played 3 separate roles, you can't tell that it's him when he plays the old man.It's great comedy, and while it's not very realistic, there are some good lessons with it. I like the unity and fearlessness of the children, and that helping Eli is all that matters to them. It kind of gives a sense that helping others is much more important than money."
434,tt0322330,9,"Look . . . I'm mainly into sci-fi, fantasy, action-thriller, and special effects movies (i.e. Matrix, LOTR, Identity, Star Wars, etc.) and generally try to avoid chic flicks and warm-fuzzy feel-good movies.  After watching the current Freaky Friday starring Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan now I understand why.See, I'm a guy, and guys don't cry, well, that's what we've been told.  On top of that I'm 48 years old so I'd better have my maturity act together. So, what happened?  Besides laughing my butt off at the truly funny scenes (my wife and I caught a few stares from other movie-goers), I had to strain every muscle in my body to keep from bawling like a, no, it can't be true .. . girl.I might have to consult a therapist (Jamie Lee can certainly fill that role anytime) to understand why this movie had such a profound effect on my emotions.  Maybe it's because my parents never really understood me (I certainly understand them now) or maybe it's because I have a couple daughters and I've rarely tried to put myself in their shoes.  This movie accomplished that for me, big time . . . the ultimate exercise in empathy.
The interaction between mother and daughter was superbly acted and very believable especially with the switched roles.  Moreover, the supporting characters, from the little brother, to the fiancé, to the grandfather, to even the detention monitor at the school were also outstanding and made this story a real winner.I can honestly say that this is in my top 20 favorite movies of all time and I will most certainly buy the DVD when available.  I can't believe I've been saying all this about a movie way out of my usual genre but here it is, in writing.  Please watch this movie, and then tell me I'm not losing it. Enjoy!"
435,tt0322330,1,"I admit, I was dragged to this movie by my 12-year-old cousin. At first I thought, ""Lindsay Lohan? Who's that? And Jamie Lee Curtis? Isn't that the 'scream queen'?"" I didn't want to go, but that was that.
Within the first few minutes of the movie, I rolled my eyes. I thought it was just a cliche movie about a mom and a daughter that fight a lot. I was bored. But ten minutes later, the magic began. I found my eyes glued to the massive screen, I found myself ""shushing"" anyone that interrupted my connection with the two stars. I was hooked, and that was that.
Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis work wonders together. They have wonderful chemistry on screen that make you believe that they have, in fact, switched bodies. Both actresses were brilliant in their roles of switch reversal. Their acting was so real, their expressions so priceless. Awesome, too, was the movie's supporting cast. Enough said. The script was amazingly well written, the directing extraordinary.To sum it up, this movie was ""freakishly good."" Pure magic, I tell you."
436,tt0322330,8,"This is about the third adaptation of the Mary Rodgers novel. Finally, the team behind this film has gotten it together. It's obvious the original text has been revised in order to include the language of today. But the best thing about the movie is the casting assembled for it, with a sure director's hand behind it.Actually, this is about the first film that has made me laugh since ""Bringing down the house"" that came out earlier this year. Most comedies today seem to forget that the basic premise for their existence is to amuse the audiences and entertain them, at the same time.Mark Waters, the director shows he has a fine sense of how to make things move constantly in this comedy about identity changes. Of course, this film wouldn't be half the fun it is without Jamie Lee Curtis, who has never been as effective in any previous films. Her take on Tess Coleman, the not so cool therapist, strikes the right tone.Her daughter is played with a lot of conviction by Lindsay Lohan, who is totally believable as the typical teen ager working through the pain of losing a father and getting a replacement she is not too fond of.Things move at a rapid pace; there is never a dull moment in the film. It's a perfect summer comedy that will leave the viewer satisfied and happy."
437,tt0322330,7,"To make Freaky Friday work perfectly; you would have to believe that Jamie Lee Curtis is Lindsay Lohan and Lindsay Lohan is Jamie Lee Curtis. Although at times it seemed that way, at other times, it just seemed like Lohan was trying to be Curtis and Curtis was trying to be Lohan. Any way you look at it, Freaky Friday is a family-friendly film that tries to please everyone, and does. It pleases shallow teen prep girls because of Chad Michael Murray. It pleases teen boys because of Lindsay Lohan. It pleases older men because of a Jamie Lee Curtis thong shot. It pleases older women because of Mark Harmon. It pleases the whole family, being that they already saw Finding Nemo and it's the only other family movie out there.Tess Coleman (Jamie Lee Curtis) (changed from Ellen Andrews from the novel by Mary Rodgers) is a harried psychiatrist who still has time for her family. Anna Colemen (Lohan) (changed from Annabel Andrews) is supposed to be a typical teenager (but is anything but), and has daily fights with her younger brother Harry (Ryan Malgarini) (changed from Ben Andrews). Tess is going to marry Ryan (Harmon), because her husband died three years ago (can't there be a Disney movie with both parents still alive?), of whom Anna doesn't approve. After a fueled feud, Tess and Anna open fortune cookies that switch bodies: Tess is in Anna's body, and vice versa. Whatever will be done?Although most people have praised Curtis for her accurate portrayal of a typical teen (although with the people at my school, what she does is anything but typical), and she should be, Lohan does better at being an adult. If Lohan, a teenager, could be an adult so well, that's rather scary. I thought at most times Lohan was Tess, but Curtis was having too much fun as Anna to really be thought of as great. Instead of acting like Lohan, Curtis just acts like a young kid who just ate too much ice cream.One part of Freaky Friday that I didn't like is how often we were put in an awkward situation. And when they were there, they just didn't seem plausible. All of a sudden, Anna-as-Tess is a guest on a talk show, talks to someone she has a crush on, and watches Tess-as-Anna perform? Not only were they awkward, they were just not believable. On the other hand, Freaky Friday not only has some genuinely funny moments, but is also quite touching at times. Obviously, it was going to be, and Tess and Anna were going to learn to respect each other, considering it was shown in the trailer.One other part I didn't like was how far it strayed from the book. It only focused on Anna-as-Tess (Annabel-as-Ellen), and how she spent her day. Of course, back then she was a housewife, but now she has to be a successful doctor. I do admire it for changing it, unlike others, which is basically watching the book. Overall, Freaky Friday is a likable, pleasant 90-minute diverter. It won't change your life, but you won't be upset you saw it.My rating: 7/10Rated PG for mild thematic elements and some language."
438,tt0322330,9,"I've been wanting to see this film since the trailers started playing many moons ago. I saw the Jody Foster version when it first came out in 1976 and like that one, the 2003 version is an excellent all ages movie. It reminds me of the great flicks Disney use to release all the time during the 60's and 70's so it was no surprise they reached to the vault to redo ""Freaky Friday"".Jamie Lee Curtis has her best comedy role since ""A Fish Called Wanda"". She was having fun with the part and many of the teen mannerisms she did as Annabell were dead on. Curtis is one of the most underrated actors in the world. Just based on her performance ""Freaky Friday"" was a great ride.Lindsay Lohan made the movie better with her take on Annabell. I have liked Lohan since ""The Parent Trap"" and if she decides to stay with acting she might go on as long as Jody Foster has in the business. Lohan has one thing that actors like Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts have and that is an expressive face. Acting is so much better when the actor can add to their part through the expressions in their face and Lindsay can do that.Watching the movie was a delight for me. I never got the feeling that 35 year old men wrote the script (they didn't) like I do with some of the ""teen"" movies out today.The music used by the movie band ""Pink Slip"" was above average and the other soundtrack music fit the film as well.Now if they would just do a big budget ""Herbie the Love Bug"" feature, I would be even more happy."
439,tt0322330,9,"Look . . . I'm mainly into sci-fi, fantasy, action-thriller, and special effects movies (i.e. Matrix, LOTR, Identity, Star Wars, etc.) and generally try to avoid chic flicks and warm-fuzzy feel-good movies.  After watching the current Freaky Friday starring Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan now I understand why.See, I'm a guy, and guys don't cry, well, that's what we've been told.  On top of that I'm 48 years old so I'd better have my maturity act together. So, what happened?  Besides laughing my butt off at the truly funny scenes (my wife and I caught a few stares from other movie-goers), I had to strain every muscle in my body to keep from bawling like a, no, it can't be true .. . girl.I might have to consult a therapist (Jamie Lee can certainly fill that role anytime) to understand why this movie had such a profound effect on my emotions.  Maybe it's because my parents never really understood me (I certainly understand them now) or maybe it's because I have a couple daughters and I've rarely tried to put myself in their shoes.  This movie accomplished that for me, big time . . . the ultimate exercise in empathy.
The interaction between mother and daughter was superbly acted and very believable especially with the switched roles.  Moreover, the supporting characters, from the little brother, to the fiancé, to the grandfather, to even the detention monitor at the school were also outstanding and made this story a real winner.I can honestly say that this is in my top 20 favorite movies of all time and I will most certainly buy the DVD when available.  I can't believe I've been saying all this about a movie way out of my usual genre but here it is, in writing.  Please watch this movie, and then tell me I'm not losing it. Enjoy!"
440,tt0322330,1,"I admit, I was dragged to this movie by my 12-year-old cousin. At first I thought, ""Lindsay Lohan? Who's that? And Jamie Lee Curtis? Isn't that the 'scream queen'?"" I didn't want to go, but that was that.
Within the first few minutes of the movie, I rolled my eyes. I thought it was just a cliche movie about a mom and a daughter that fight a lot. I was bored. But ten minutes later, the magic began. I found my eyes glued to the massive screen, I found myself ""shushing"" anyone that interrupted my connection with the two stars. I was hooked, and that was that.
Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis work wonders together. They have wonderful chemistry on screen that make you believe that they have, in fact, switched bodies. Both actresses were brilliant in their roles of switch reversal. Their acting was so real, their expressions so priceless. Awesome, too, was the movie's supporting cast. Enough said. The script was amazingly well written, the directing extraordinary.To sum it up, this movie was ""freakishly good."" Pure magic, I tell you."
441,tt0322330,8,"This is about the third adaptation of the Mary Rodgers novel. Finally, the team behind this film has gotten it together. It's obvious the original text has been revised in order to include the language of today.

443,tt0287003,3,"......if you're into the ""lost critter"" genre. This film was created during a period when nature footage was gaining popularity. This film has a narrator that tells the story of two misplaced critters, a bear and a raccoon. This is much different than later films where the animals talk for themselves. For this reason the film plays out like a nature documentary. There's some nice scenes that are very interesting. The overall nostalgic atmosphere does ignite that childlike wonder in the wild. I think it is worth a watch......at least once."
444,tt0287003,1,Mindnumbingly boring and utterly pointless one of the worst things I've stumbled across on Disney plus and there's been some pretty bad moments.
445,tt0287003,4,"After seeing The Black Hole (1979-also reviewed) I decided to check for more obscure titles on Disney+. Checking the 70's flicks on the site,I spotted one I had never heard of before! Leading to me follow the tail of these two critters.View on the film:Released as the B-Movie to The Rescuers, writer/director Jack Speirs scratches a pleasant atmosphere, where the staged bonding between the animals is sweetened by Mayf Nutter's cheerful narration and Buddy Baker's jaunty score.Whilst a large amount of this ""Nature Documentary"" is clearly fake, (footage of a second bear appears to have been filmed in a completely different location!) Speirs still claws real moments of nature,swimming with zoom-ins towards a wolverine, bear cub and raccoon fighting with each other over nabbing a fish, as the two tails shake upstream."
446,tt0287003,3,"Even at just 48 minutes, 'A Tale of Two Critters' is an utter bore.There is nothing original or interesting about this film, it's something Disney have done numerous times before - it's 1961's 'Nikki, Wild Dog of the North' mixed with 1969's 'Rascal'. The amount of bear cubs in this studio's work is quite something!Like that '61 production, and releases like 'The Legend of Lobo' and 'King of the Grizzlies' for that matter, this is very bad. There is nothing to latch onto and enjoy, it's just a number of different animals thrown (almost literally) together for a would-be documentary.Mayf Nutter does an alright job as narrator, but is barely any different to the narrators from other similar productions. Like most, if not all, of Disney's nature/documentary/adventure films, this isn't worth a watch - at least in my opinion."
447,tt0287003,1,Their opinion of this movie is trash and clearly their opinions as a whole are trash as well since they seem to be a Taylor swift fan. This movie is very much a Disney classic
448,tt0076618,1,"I may be the only person to say this but I think The Rescuers was a LOT better than the sequel. Oh don't get me wrong, Down Under's pretty good. But, to me, The Rescuers is the best.Since I was a little kid, I have had a short attention span so movies with more action generally held my attention. The Rescuers and the Pooh films were the two exceptions for me. This isn't a very fast moving film, at times it's quite slow. But that's when the tension builds. You feel a certain warmth watching it, similar to the warm fuzzies you would get from a Pooh film. It's sweet. It's fun. The characters are lovable and the villains are detestable (I mean Madame Medusa kidnaps an innocent little girl and then forces her to go into a dangerous pirate cave, if that isn't evil, I don't know what is). Even the supporting cast is awesome, if not entirely memorable. I think there were too many critters at Devil's Bayou, had they cut the cast down a bit, perhaps I could remember them all. But that's literally my only complaint.The film is slow but it doesn't feel slow. It doesn't lag at all. It keeps you completely focused on the characters. By the way, the acting is superb, particularly Michelle Stacy as Penny. Usually child actors are hit and miss but she does an excellent job, she really makes you feel for Penny and that's the most important part. Bob Newhart and Eva Gabor as Bernard and Bianca. They really bring the characters to life.The animation is beautiful as well. It all seems like a painting come to life. I am particularly impressed with Bernard and Bianca's animation because they look a lot like their voice actors. So you can't imagine a better voice for them. You often forget that they're mice. And that's really impressive.So, all in all, this is one of Disney's best. Ever. It's proof that the animation studio was still going strong after Walt Disney's death. And it's still one of my all time favorite movies. I say, check it out. There's something for everyone in it."
449,tt0076618,1,"The 23rd animated Disney classic is underrated and somewhat forgotten, yet one of Disney's finest! It's a great movie, even one of Disney's finest underrated works.This charming film, while undoubtedly heartwarming, is also creative and very lively. It has lots of adventure and suspense, classic humor, fine artwork, a wonderful soundtrack and a dark atmosphere. When I say ""dark"" I mean dark in the sense of being somewhat chilly, but without being extremely dark or a story of horror/terror. The darkness of the Devil's Bayou is amazing, creepy to the point of almost looking like a forbidding place, which helps a lot to create this distinct atmosphere.Despite the apparent simplicity, this motion picture has some very artistic palette colors. One good example of this is the amazing and gorgeous opening sequence. The beautiful but sad song 'The Journey' matches in perfection.The song 'Tomorrow is another day' is very optimistic and nostalgic. Not just that, it fits perfectly on that sequence: beautiful vistas painted with heart and soul. Besides, that rainbow and those New York City lights at night look incredibly real.The song 'Someone's waiting for you' is heartwarming, but so is the sequence itself. 'The U.S. Air Force' is a delightful instrumental music, very energetic and full of life.Medusa is a great villain. One of Disney's best villains, says I. She's mean and nasty, but at the same time funny (even hilarious at times). She is a little eccentric but not too much and not annoying. Besides, she isn't too sinister or one of the most cruel villains.Medusa's sidekick, Snoops, is someone I don't consider a real villain. He's not bad enough to be a villain and he doesn't know how to be bad, although he attempts. I think that deep down he is a good guy. I like Snoops: he's a simple and goofy guy but funny (even hilarious at times) and not that bad. He's more of a poor guy who messed with the wrong person.By the way, Medusa and Snoops have a nice pawn shop named ""Medusa's pawn shop"" or, like Medusa delightfully says on the telephone, «Madame Medusa's pawn shop boutique».Comical characters like Luke and the albatross Orville have small roles, perhaps because this movie is more of a dramatic natured one. Numerous swamp animals appear (others than Luke), but their roles are minor (with the exception of Ellie Mae and Evinrude).Bernard is the kind of romantic and shy hero. Bianca has a characteristic hungarian charm (her voice actress, Eva Gabor, was hungarian). Orville is carefree and spirited, as well as a comic relief. Like albatrosses in real life, he flies beautifully but is very bad at landings.Evinrude's sounds are awesome. They sound so real! I have no words to describe them! James MacDonald really had a gift for sounds.Penny was apparently modeled after Michelle Stacy, the cute little girl who did her voice. Penny is cute and has a very cute voice. People sympathize with Penny and her situation in the film, yet despite being very endearing she is also confident and has a strong personality - something which Snoops doesn't know how to deal with.The crocodiles Nero and Brutus are hilarious in every scene they appear. I don't know why, but there is something hilarious about them even just by looking at them. They are at their most hilarious when they play organ. And those rascals really know how to play talent, LOL. They have talent for music, LOL! Besides, although they are Medusa's loyal pets, they are good crocodiles and not vicious. Whenever they catch Penny, they always grab her carefully not to harm her. And they are just as careful with her beloved teddy bear. Even in the water they have special care with her and her teddy bear.A very good and timeless Disney classic! This is one of those animated classics I grew up with - and 'The Rescuers Down Under' too. Both were part of my childhood.1977 was one of the best years in cinema ever!This should definitely be on Top 250."
450,tt0076618,8,"One of Walt Disney's finest animated films, this concerns two mice named Bernard & Bianca, who belong to the Rescue Aid Society, that operates out of the basement of the United Nations building in New York. There is a little girl named Penny being held captive by an evil woman named Madame Medusa and her henchman Mr. Snoops, who need her to lead them to a priceless jewel in the Devil's Bayou swamp, where she is being held on a riverboat. The mice fly atop Orville the Albatross to rescue her, and defeat the villains. Surprisingly touching and thrilling film done with care and imagination, with wonderful songs. To be enjoyed by both children and adults alike."
452,tt0076618,8,"I remember seeing the second half of this film with my sister (who has the same name as the little girl in this film) while our dad was fishing and the most memorable moments from the second half were Penny being sent down the pirate cave to retrieve a diamond for Madame Medusa and Penny being shown on TV with her new mother and father. The other part of this film I remember from my childhood is the 'Someone's Waiting For You' (one of the best songs in the film) sequence because it was featured on the Disney 'Sing-A-Long Songs: Under the Sea' video tape I watched constantly as a child. As with 'Toy Story 3,' 'Dumbo' and 'The Rescuers Down Under (which is just as good as this film),' I watched this on my flight home from Dubai and I really enjoyed it.As with the majority of Disney films that came out between the 1960s and 1980s, the characters are drawn in a sketchy and linear way, thus making their animation a little on the flat side. The character designs range from being simplistic (e.g. Bernard and Bianca) to more detailed (e.g. Penny and Madame Medusa, but the facial expressions and lip-sync are spot on. As for the background designs and some of the props, they were intricately drawn, especially the bottle that contained Penny's call for help and the cars parked outside the United Nations building. My favourite characters in this film are Bernard, Bianca and Penny, who are all very sweet. Even though this film has a sentimental tone for the most part, it has a few comical moments such as Bernard unintentionally wearing Bianca's hat briefly while they are blown through the organ pipes when Brutus and Nero play it; and Penny imitating Madame Medusa as soon as Bernard and Bianca find her. In addition to 'Someone's Waiting For You,' the other songs I liked were 'The Journey,' which I initially thought was called 'Who Will Rescue Me?' but was accompanied by beautiful paintings of Penny's message in a bottle floating on the water as the opening credits were shown, and 'Rescue Aid Society,' which I found catchy, although the other songs were pretty forgettable. This film also has some clever writing, such as the running gag of Bernard's fear of the number 13 (for example when he climbs up a ladder/comb to pull Penny's message out of the bottle, he falls inside it) but it was also clichéd (Medusa being afraid of mice) and repetitive (one of Penny's lines being the same as Medusa's) in parts. One element of this film that reminded me of other films was Penny's teddy bear resembling Winnie the Pooh.Overall this was a charming film that I'd happily watch again. 8/10."
453,tt0076137,6,"'Herbie Goes To Monte Carlo' is a fun movie, and that is all it is meant to be. Some have said that it is not nearly as good as 'The Love Bug,' but let's face it: none of the Herbie films are about great brilliance. They are all about having fun and getting a laugh. The kids and I really enjoyed it.It is great to see Dean Jones again, and he plays Jim Douglas as someone who knows, understands, and even loves Herbie. My only criticism of this film is that it lacks Buddy Hackett. Still, Don Knotts is a wonderful replacement.On a four-star rating system, I give this one ***. Come to think of it, that is about what I would rate 'The Love Bug.' The DVD of 'Herbie Goes To Monte Carlo' does not feature any extras, but there are plenty on the 'Love Bug' set, certainly enough to cover both films. Funny stuff, and loads of fun!"
454,tt0076137,1,"Although the movie is quite old, the special effects are obvious and the cgi non-existent, this is one of the best family-movies ever. The story is simple, two thieves have hidden a diamond in a race-car which is now competing in the Trans-France Race, but it isn't your usual VW. And who is this mysterious Mister X?The scenes where Herbie and the Lancia meet are unforgettable, the two thieves are pretty much the comic relief, the love interest Diane has some pretty sharp edges, and the racing against the German and the French guy adds another point of tension to it.The low rate for this movie surprised me. I thought it was a very good movie, with action, nice characters, humour, and some good fun. 8/10"
455,tt0076137,6,"When you think about Herbie Goes To Monte Carlo raises some interesting philosophical questions. Such as how is the sex of a car determined? Are here certain part variations as there are with animals or is the sex determined by the owner?You won't get the answer to these questions, but with Dean Jones as racing driver Jim Douglas back at the steering wheel you will get a reasonably fun movie from the Disney Studio. This is the third Herbie film from the Magic Kingdom and it lives up to the standard created by the first one.Jones after giving the car over to the tender care of Helen Hayes in the second film is back at the wheel, this time with Don Knotts instead of Buddy Hackett as his mechanic. Though I like Knotts very much as a performer, something was definitely missing without Buddy Hackett in the film. You'd have to have seen the first to appreciate it, but Hackett was the first to discover the true essence of Herbie, the Volkwagen with a soul.Dean and Don have several problems to overcome. The first is a pair of inept jewel thieves who nearly get themselves caught even with all the museum layout and security systems information. To avoid capture Bernard Fox and Roy Kinnear dump one very large diamond into Herbie's gas tank before the Grand Prix race from Paris to Monte Carlo. The second is an officious German driver who apparently well remembers that Volkswagen's were not vehicles of sport from the Third Reich. Eric Braeden is one of those Germans you just love to hate.The final problem is Herbie who takes one look at the lines on the car Julie Sommars is driving and guess what, her car has a soul as well. I guess you needed a handsome, devilish may car, rogue like Herbie to bring it out. He also of course brings Julie and Dean together, though I do have to wonder what happened with Michele Lee from the original film.Nice location scenery of France, the countryside and the metropolitan areas of Paris and Monte Carlo definitely help one enjoy this film even if you're not a devoted fan of the soulful Herbie."

Meanwhile Herbie with the number 53 intervenes in the biggest race cars from Paris to Monte Carlo and win the Grand Prize , a challenge among top competitors circle the world's most famous racing circuits and quickly slipping in the ranking.This ordinary Disney slapdash film displays great loads of amusement , fun , giggles , race cars and is pretty entertaining . It's an enjoyable movie for kids and for those who enjoy cars racing round and round and bounds and leaps by Herbie . The actors seem to enjoy immensely , as Dean Jones and Don Knotts play of sympathetic manner and the mean-spirited villains performed by Ron Kinnear , Bernard Fox and Jacques Marin are top notch . Brief appearance as sympathetic waiter by Gerard Jugnot subsequently prestigious player in the successful ¨The choir boys ¨. Colorful cinematography by Leonard South and jolly soundtrack by Frank De Vol including the lively leitmotif , usual in the Herbie's series. This is a delightful film , the original film turns out to be : ¨The love bug¨ (1969) by Robert Stevenson with Dean Jones, Michele Lee and Buddy Hackett , followed by ¨ Herbie rides again (1974)¨ also by Robert Stevenson and starred by Ken Berry , Stefanie Powers and Helen Hayes ; it's followed by ¨Herbie goes to Montecarlo¨ and ¨Herbie goes bananas¨ (1980 , or Herbie Torero) by Vincent McEveety starred by Charles Martin Smith and Cloris Leachman , among others and a 1997-for-television-movie and a TV series , the most part filmed by Stevenson and Vincent McEveety and usually starred by Dean Jones . Furthermore recent version starred by Linsay Lohan , Justin Long and Matt Dillon , being directed by Angela Robinson. This "" Herbie goes to Monte Carlo¨ version is amusing and with lots of laughs but is a familiar film . The motion picture is correctly directed by Vincent McEveety . Worthwhile seeing , typical Disney slapstick ,it's a great fun to watch and there are loads of entertainment in this one . It' one of the best and funniest of ¨Herbie¨ series ."
457,tt2788732,7,"This updated version wasn't quite what I was expecting, though surprisingly good. The dominant theme is friendship and family and they explore this through a rather subtle tension. Pete loves Elliot, but he also needs a family (which he finds in surrogate form through Bryce Dallas-Howard, her fiancé and his young daughter).The threat feels shoehorned in, as Karl Urban's inexplicably vengeful logger decides to hunt down the dragon and do...well, he hasn't really thought that one through. It's a weak plot device that sells the story a little short, but is ultimately forgivable. I had a sizeable lump in my throat at several points in the film, and I'm not one for sentimentality. Director Lowery handles the emotion well, particularly through an inspired folksy soundtrack.There are distinct shades of ET here, as a boy comes to terms with the impossibility of a critical friendship. Not a lot really happens in this movie, but what you get is well paced and thoughtful.Well worth a watch."
458,tt2788732,1,"Liked this a lot. I was 4 when I first saw Pete's dragon way back in '83 or whatever back in England. I remember how much I loved the idea of Pete's dragon. I watched the original a few years back and realized that it was a fairly average musical with an animated dragon. But still!!!! I remember how great the story or idea of a personal dragon was. The modern spin is very sentimental, but never cheesy. Everything was great; from casting to special effects. I really enjoyed this movie. If you remember the old Pete's dragon from back when you were a skid, you'll love this movie. To be completely honest, there were several tear jerker moments. I guess they really nailed down the aspects of a child becoming suddenly orphaned. They also did a really good job if propelling the story so that it never sat idle. Robert Redford played the integral old timer part, but played it exceptionally well as to be expected.

459,tt2788732,8,"The 1977 'Pete's Dragon' was a favourite as a child. As far as by today's standards, while not a great film and not as good through adult eyes (plus there are better live-action Disney films, especially the timeless 'Mary Poppins'), it's still well worth watching.Despite having some really talented names on board, expectations were both of great interest but feeling dubious. It did have potential to be better than the 1977 film, and still stand very well on its own, or it could have been a lazy and pointless cash-grab. While it is not perfect by any stretch of the imagination, it proved to be a better film than anticipated.Not one of the best live-action Disney re-imaginings like 'Cinderella' and 'The Jungle Book' (much better than 'Maleficent' though), but still for a re-imagining 'Pete's Dragon' was a good one. It is let down by the final act, where the darker and more action-packed tone jars with what was happening before in the film and at this point the film starts to feel rushed. The villain just felt very shoehorned in and out of place, for the sake of ""needing"" an ""obligatory"" villain for conflict (that to me wasn't necessary), not helped by the hammy performance of Karl Urban that just feels out of kilter with the rest of the cast.Where 'Pete's Dragon' especially soars is in the very charming and touching friendship chemistry between Pete and Elliot, essentially the heart of the film. Speaking of Elliot, he is a very lovingly crafted creature with not just beautiful details to him but also with a personality that wins one over in how endearing he is.'Pete's Dragon', apart from some overly grim lighting in places, looks great visually, the splendid scenery being especially good complemented beautifully by cinematography that's atmospheric and picturesque. The music is lovingly whimsical and fits the film well when it could easily have not done.Scripting serves its purpose well and doesn't hurt the atmosphere or the central friendship at all, weakening only with the villain and when the film gets darker. David Lowery directs very capably and balances the various elements well. Although it won't work, and hasn't worked, for some (with criticisms of it being thin narratively, slow-moving and either too sentimental or cold), for me the story (radically altered with a more sombre tone for example) was immensely charming and appreciated the calmer, straightforward, more gentle and deliberate nature of the story which allowed the friendship to resonate. Never found it mawkish and thought that there was enough emotion without it overshadowing things, though admittedly there is not much that is particularly new.Urban aside, the acting is good. Oakes Fegley and Oona Laurence are very appealing, while Bryce Dallas Howard is luminous and compassionate and, while not being on screen for long, Robert Redford achieves the right balance of the grizzled and the sympathetic. But essentially it is Elliot and the friendship between him and Pete that carry the film, and, as they should, captivate most strongly.In summary, while with its foibles 'Pete's Dragon' was a much more impressive re-imagining than expected after mixed expectations. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
460,tt2788732,8,"Aah, where to begin. I was five years old when the original came out and it was the first ever film I saw on the big screen. For that experience alone I'll treasure the ""old"" 'Pete's Dragon' forever.Now to the ""new"" film. I'm not normally into family movies, but because I hold such a deep love for the original, I just couldn't resist to go to a pre-screening of this remake. If they didn't honor the original, at the very least I could voice my opinion afterwards on the internet. I needn't have worried - although it may come as a shock to some viewers that the film doesn't have much in common with the original at all. But this new 'Pete's Dragon' is about as far away from a cheap cash grab as it could be. Unlike the original, the new film starts on a somber note (think the beginning of The Jungle Book, Tarzan or Bambi) in that a little boy is orphaned by an accident and left alone in the woods. But just like the best fairy tales, I feel a good story often needs some darker themes: for without those, the joyous moments wouldn't feel as intense and rewarding. And this is very true here, for what follows is a tale of friendship, adventure, magic and wonder like I hadn't seen since those wonderful Spielberg films in the eighties.The story is sentimental - but never cheesy - and that is one of its greatest strengths: it dares to have a heart but it's not the kind of over-sugary tripe we so often get from big studios. The film's biggest asset, though, is easily Elliot. I had feared (because I had seen a trailer) that Elliot would be a cringe-worthy CGI creature of the worst kind, but the trailers really did the special effects wizards a bad service: the dragon design is perhaps the most beautiful (and I'm not ashamed to say it: cute) I've ever seen.It blends perfectly with the natural surroundings (gorgeous New Zealand forests) and while this particular dragon has more traits of a playful, over-sized dog than of a dinosaur, it looks so realistic you believe you can touch and feel Elliot's fur (the 3-d works great for this film), and his face is so expressive you forget you're watching a CGI character.All in all, this really is a film I can whole heartedly recommend to people of all ages, but if you have kids, watch it as soon as possible, you won't regret it. Despite going down a very different route than the original, it's still a throwback to a different era when Disney made the best quality family films (which were so good they are still immensely popular today), utterly devoid of the now so common cynicism, and full of heart, joy and wonder. 9 stars out of 10."

To be fair, there were a few things that were not too great (like some of the actors), but for some reason I could see beyond that. Thanks to the beautiful story itself, the magnificent cinematography, the lifelike CGI animation of Elliot (the dragon) and the superb acting of Oakes Fegley as Pete.David Lowery did a good job directing the movie, and casting Robert Redford as Meacham was a smart choice.I can only recommend this movie - and not only to families and kids, but to everybody who's open to fairy tales and magic."

Firstly I want to tell you that I had my doubts, I din't know if it was going to be any good. Luckily the doubts disappeared as soon as I saw the first scene, I'm not going to spoil it but it was an amazing intro to a brilliant movie which is always keeping you interested and intrigued.Disney has a unique, almost magical way of touching your soul, and it did just that in this movie. It will make you feel like a kid again, no matter how old you are. It will make you feel sad, it will make you feel happy and it will make you feel angry. I'm not ashamed to admit that I cried a lot and also caught myself yelling at the screen! You share the character's emotions and you are feeling like you belong in the story. Another thing that helps with that is the kid who plays remarkably good, and the dragon that feels like real.I strongly recommend it to you. Anyone can watch it. Your kids, you and even the older people can enjoy this amazing fairy-tale."
463,tt2788732,4,"I worry about taking pot shots at a movie like Pete's Dragon. No one wants a twentysomething's jaded take on a kid's movie. I am aware I am not the target audience. The ticket vendor's surprise at my selection was no surprise to me. What can I say? The other option was an anthropomorphic hot dog. I took the chance because a children's film can be a light fantasy. Disney has taught everyone that ""fun for the whole family"" is not a death sentence. So when I criticize Pete's Dragon, understand I am not assailing aspects of the genre, e.g. the simplistic plot. That's not the movie's goal nor should it be my point. Pete's Dragon fails because it is utterly devoid of wonder.True, wonder is a pretty squishy concept. Fortunately for me, my sense of wonder need not go on trial. That's because of my official co-reviewer, the kid who sat immediately next to me in the otherwise empty theater. He looked about the same age as Pete, our protagonist. I regret not asking. Regardless, I understand why this story could be appealing to my new colleague. Pete is tragically separated from his parents, but is rescued by a forest dwelling dragon. Pete names his new friend Elliot and together they spend their days playing in the woods and sleeping in a tree/cave/house. It is an idyllic existence, but it is ruined by the interference of other humans. Pete is threatened by greedy loggers and, the Nazis of family movies, child protective services. However, our hero finds some allies in ranger Grace (Howard) and her storytelling father (Redford). The entire movie scored two responses from my associate. First, a chuckle when Elliot gets a dosing of soot from a chimney. Second, a genuine chortle when an EMT dropped a stretcher. That part was my favorite too. Almost Two hours, two laughs. I refuse to believe this is the best Disney can offer. Admittedly, my second did applaud at the close, but this reaction was not half as enthusiastic as when his dad bought him a Slurpee.Now hopefully I can take over explain what went wrong. First, the titular dragon. It is a dog. Elliot the big green dog. Elliot chases his tale. Elliot sneezes on people. Elliot is a dog. Whyyyyyyyyyyy? This is one of the most pathetic attempts at satisfying the boundless imaginations of children I have ever seen. Even the flying shots are derivative, all rendered in CG that just screams ""I was meant to be seen in 3D."" Well I'm cheap. All the other characters were equally tedious. Any idiosyncrasy or characteristic would have been appreciated. You can learn all there is to know about these personalities in 15 seconds. For the remainder of the movie, they will never surprise you, or charm you, or do anything worthy or remembrance. Part of the reason I attended Pete's Dragon was to gather data on the condition of Redford's career. I dread saying this, but this another performance suggesting he is washed up. Then again, in the role, Redford might never have stood a chance. Watching him mug like he was witnessing the second coming because a dragon turned a lighter shade of green was embarrassing. Another sad waste of talent was the cinematographer. The forest itself was the most magnetic character in the film. The natural beauty set a tone, only to be beaten down by the ham-fisted elements. So yes, I guess there was some wonder. Not enough to be redeemable. Pete's Dragon is a soulless morality tale on the importance of the nuclear family. Its grand aspiration was being inoffensive enough so you could bring your children. Disney can do better and we should watch better."

466,tt2788732,5,"I was pretty underwhelmed after watching the movie. Disney needs to rethink what live action movies they are making. The jungle book was renown and popular and almost everyone knew about the same and it was a good retelling of the story nothing spectacular but enjoyable. Pete's dragon at least for me was a film that I had no prior knowledge about and after seeing the film the content of the original story seems to be pretty bland. This is a film purely for kids below 10 years. The dragon is very well animated but the acting by the child actors is average at the best. the ""villain"" is shoehorned just for the sake of it. The content just was not riveting enough and it is a boring and bland 2 hour movie with some moments which will draw out an emotional response and those are very few and far between. If you have kids go watch it with them they would surely enjoy it. The theater I went had majority of the audience in the 6-10 year group and there were enough giggles and awes to know that they were enjoying the movie. Only recommended for kids."
467,tt2788732,7,"This updated version wasn't quite what I was expecting, though surprisingly good. The dominant theme is friendship and family and they explore this through a rather subtle tension. Pete loves Elliot, but he also needs a family (which he finds in surrogate form through Bryce Dallas-Howard, her fiancé and his young daughter).The threat feels shoehorned in, as Karl Urban's inexplicably vengeful logger decides to hunt down the dragon and do...well, he hasn't really thought that one through. It's a weak plot device that sells the story a little short, but is ultimately forgivable. I had a sizeable lump in my throat at several points in the film, and I'm not one for sentimentality. Director Lowery handles the emotion well, particularly through an inspired folksy soundtrack.There are distinct shades of ET here, as a boy comes to terms with the impossibility of a critical friendship. Not a lot really happens in this movie, but what you get is well paced and thoughtful.Well worth a watch."
468,tt2788732,1,"Liked this a lot. I was 4 when I first saw Pete's dragon way back in '83 or whatever back in England. I remember how much I loved the idea of Pete's dragon. I watched the original a few years back and realized that it was a fairly average musical with an animated dragon. But still!!!! I remember how great the story or idea of a personal dragon was. The modern spin is very sentimental, but never cheesy. Everything was great; from casting to special effects. I really enjoyed this movie. If you remember the old Pete's dragon from back when you were a skid, you'll love this movie. To be completely honest, there were several tear jerker moments. I guess they really nailed down the aspects of a child becoming suddenly orphaned. They also did a really good job if propelling the story so that it never sat idle. Robert Redford played the integral old timer part, but played it exceptionally well as to be expected.

They kidnap Ike after seeing an example of his powers of levitation and seek to use him and fit him with a mind control device that Lee's been perfecting.Lee's dreaming some big dreams and Davis has some more mundane schemes like a trip to some gambling house or racetrack. Both of them looking like they are having one grand old time hamming it up for the cameras.Of course the film wouldn't work at all if it were not for the winning personalities of Richards and Eisenman. Both come across as real kids, not sure of the extent of their own powers rather than Hollywood juvenile actors.The whole of the film is Richards pursuing and trying to rescue her brother and in the process she recruits a gang of juveniles escaping from a truant officer played by the ever deadpan funny Jack Soo.

The effects are outdated, the plot is nothing particularly special and the script has some weak spots. But it is definitely worth watching, as the film skips along nicely, is well directed and there are some humorous scenes with the juvenile group. Not to mention the lively car chase. But the acting is the best asset of this film. Jack Soo is hilarious in his supporting role and Kim Richards and Ike Eisenmann reprise their roles and very well might I add. Christopher Lee is a finely sinister lead villain, but it is the legendary Bette Davis's picture all the way, as the actress brings a touch of colour into a film that could have easily been bland, and with that colour it made the film worth watching. 7/10 Bethany Cox"

If Disney had produce the pinnacle of special effects, acting and storyline for its day, everyone would trash it as being either too complex, or unsuitable for children. Disney makes movies for kids, that's what they do. Deal with it.Kids would be frightened by a true alien being, so a cat is a suitable substitute, makes for a warm cuddly visual even. The story had to be simple or kids wouldn't and couldn't follow it.Those who want to critique this film as though it were high art need to get over it.

I imagine that there were legal technicalities that prevented Disney Studios from outrightly saying it was the Salvation Army.In any event the father fakes his own death and there is a will that leaves the holdings of an entire town to the winner of a race that the two sons have to participate in. So the missionary Dale finds out when he goes west with two young orphans Debbie Lytton and Michael Sharrett. It's a kind old west marathon with a pentathlon of sorts involved as well. Gunfighter Dale of course is ready to do in his missionary brother. But a certain divine hand of Providence seems to be watching over the missionary. Definitely has to be because he's also getting new school teacher Karen Valentine in the bargain.Don Knotts as the sheriff and Jack Elam a notorious former outlaw whose best days are behind him provide a few laughs. Ever since Knotts was Barney Fife he was always being cast as comic authority figures. And there's Darren McGavin who has his own ideas about the Dale fortune should be used for.With so many familiar and talented faces in the cast of Hot Lead And Cold Feet you know it's going to be good. Dale does a wonderful job investing the father and three sons he plays with a certain individuality in each role. This film is still good family entertainment."
525,tt1104001,7,"Kevin Flynn (Bridges) is the CEO of Encom and the world's best video game developer. One night he simply vanishes without a trace and leaves his company in chaos and his young son. Fast-forward 20 years, Sam Flynn (Hedlund) is a rebellious 27 year old and a thorn in the side of Richard Mackey (Nordling), a suit trying to take over his father's company with the help of a software designer (an uncredited cameo from Cillian Murphy). Though Sam is the heir, he refuses to play an active role in the decision-making process. Alan Bradley (Boxleitner) meets him one night with the news that he has received a page from Kevin Flynn's arcade - a number that has been disconnected for 20 years. Thus ensues the inevitable investigation into his father's whereabouts and Sam's transportation into the world his father has created and been trapped in for decades.Where to begin? Tron: Legacy is a visual feast for your eyes and an auditory pleasure thanks to Daft Punk and Joseph Trapanese. The soundtrack feels ethereal almost and fits perfectly with this new world we have been introduced to for the first time (or the 2nd time if you've seen the 1982 original). 3D, for me, is a recent scourge that has been infecting and affecting the movie industry. Yes, maybe it is a more lucrative avenue for the movie industry after the setback of heavy piracy but enough is enough! Joseph Kosinski, however, had a vision (and an architectural degree behind him) to give us a mouth-opening, simply beautiful world with the correct blend of 2D and 3D! It is quite simply worth it just to go for the visuals.What the movie makes up for in spectacular imagery, it lacks in storyline. Maybe I should have watched the 1982 version as so many people have pointed out to me but even without it, the plot seems a little disjointed. The underlying connections to the real world are numerous such as The Holocaust, God complexes, evil doppelgangers and more. You are left with more questions than answers as it is never revealed just what it is about this world that would ""change everything"" in the real world.Jeff Bridges is great as both the villain and hero and his computer animated self is simply amazing although at the same time off-putting (this might be the Uncanny Valley hypothesis at work). The acting overall is not anything to write home about (no Oscar winners here) but Hedlund as Sam Flynn holds his own against a more charismatic Jeff Bridges. Quorra (Wilde) provides a potential love interest and the key to changing our world and a doe-eyed innocent view of life that is endearing.This is a movie that should be simply taken for what it is, a pandering to the original fan base whilst garnering new ones, one not to be over- analysed but simply to be marvelled at with a group of friends. The actions scenes are just jaw-dropping with light cycles (that I wish I owned!) and deadly Frisbees amongst other things. Disney took a risk to continue a series almost 3 decades later rather than going for the easy option of re-imagining it. A wise move."
526,tt1104001,8,"I have never seen the original 'Tron', nor do I really know much about it really. I've only heard the movie referenced on occasion (like that one episode of The Simpsons where Homer's trapped in the Third Dimension and he asks if anybody saw the movie 'Tron', and everyone says ""No.""). The previews for 'Tron: Legacy' looked visually stunning, and I'm happy to report it does not disappoint in that regard. Everything seen inside ""The Grid"" is a wonder to behold, a visual feast. But is this the only thing the film has going for it? Well...yes and no. As far as the characters/actors who portray them are concerned...Garrett Hedlund is good as Sam Flynn. Yes, he has to utter some clunky dialogue along the way and is a bit stiff at times, but he serves the role well enough. At times he reminded me of Hayden Christensen as Anakin Skywalker (what with the pulling out of lightsabers...I mean discs, donning of cloaks, etc) - though not half as bad as him.Jeff Bridges gives a solid performance as Sam's dad, Kevin Flynn. The only thing that detracts from his acting is his digitised clone, Clu. No matter how hard they have tried to create a youthful-looking Jeff Bridges using computer magic, he still looks like a ""cartoon"" (as someone in the audience put it). While it's annoying, it would have at least been tolerable if it had been limited to just the scenes inside The Grid. However, the movie starts in the the real world with a ""young"" Kevin Flynn telling his son the story of Tron/The Grid, and you can plainly tell the drastic difference between a real and fake Jeff Bridges. It's so obvious, and very distracting. Olivia Wilde kicks butt and looks great doing it (in her skintight catsuit with neon highlights and her asymmetrical wig) as the warrior, Quorra. She seems to be having a lot more fun with this role than she does with that of Thirteen on 'House'. Quorra has a slight naivety about her in regards to some things, and displays a sense of childlike wonder on occasion (especially the end), which gives her some depth. Wilde and Hedlund share some good scenes together, and her character at least gets *some* development - which is more than I can say for the albino-like ""Siren"", Gem (Beau Garrett).Michael Sheen is memorable as Castor. While he does tend to ""ham it up"" a bit, it's nonetheless a delightful performance.Apart from the animation of Young Kevin Flynn, there are a couple of other 'minuses' of the film, like the dialogue (which is oftentimes average) and the fact that the film itself does seem to drag in spots/go on for a bit too long.However, the visuals *do* almost manage to make up for most of the film's faults (almost). The movie looks stunning - after we get past the kinda boring beginning and are transported along with Sam inside The Grid. Light Cycles, Light Runners, all mode of ""Light"" transportation make for thrilling action/chase sequences. Then there's the ""games"", that mostly seem to involve throwing discs - which resemble Xena's round killing thing - at each other, causing those who are hit to ""derez"" (ie. cease to exist). Another 'plus' for this film is its excellent score. It adds SO much to the movie.The film is entertaining enough, but probably not the non-stop action some people are expecting/hoping for. If you're looking to kill a couple hours watching something that's visually pleasing (but, at the same time, may give you a headache/sore eyes thanks to the 3D), then 'Tron: Legacy' is worth checking out. Fans of the original may or may not like this movie, I'm not sure, but I know that for someone like myself - who's being introduced to the world of 'Tron' for the first time - it was quite something."
483,tt0077698,1,"Howdy! It's time to talk about that rootin-tootin crazy old classic funny family Disney western live action film from 1978 (whew!), ""Hot Lead and Cold Feet!"" It has many stars; Don Knotts being one of them, and it's a funny film that took place in the old west! There's a funny locomotive race included as well! And the best part is the theme song: it combines the pride of a western movie theme with the retroness of the 70s; in this case, for a second, it sounds like that ""da-da-da-da"" part from Stevie Wonder's ""Living For The City!"" LOLI've seen this first on DVD because I was learning French and I needed a fresh start (as always), and I thought this movie was awesome, considering that Disney was about to go down to meltdown mode major in a few years after the film was released. My family thought the same as well.""Hot Lead and Cold Feet"" is awesome!!!!!10 stars"
484,tt0077698,1,"This is the funniest comedy western movie.  Walt was a visionary.  I hope one day another generation can appreciate this movie.  Good versus evil,  it will always be great to watch. Don is comedic magician. And one man plays 3 roles and does an excellent job. A must see A+"
485,tt0077698,5,"A family film to be sure, Hot Lead and Cold Feet provides antics to please the children and bemuse the adults.  It makes attempts at being a western but is overridden by its slapstick comedy and wholesome family values.The film focuses on a contest rigged by Jasper Bloodsky (Jim Dale), founder of the small western town of Bloodsky, to his twin sons Wild Billy and Eli (both also played by Jim Dale).  The problem?  Eli is a Bible-thumping preacher from the East and Wild Billy is the region's most feared outlaw.Possible spoiler belowDespite Billy's best attempts to rig the race in his favor, Eli always manages to overcome the obstacles (such as a canoe with holes drilled in it) to be only one step behind Billy.  As the race continues, the two orphans that Eli brought with him, discover that Mayor Ragsdale (Darren McGavin) plans on killing both brothers and keeping the money for himself.So the kids - along with their pretty school teacher - go on the rescue. After many humorous mishaps they find the brothers and tell them what's going to happen to them.  Several hours later, Wild Billy rides into town the victor, just as the mayor is taking off with the money.  They catch the mayor, and Billy agrees to share the money with Eli; and they set forth to change the wild town into a respectable community.end of spoilerAnd - as in all good Disney films - they lived happily ever after.It should be noted that the truly outstanding performance of Don Knotts as the sheriff made the movie.  His nervous mannerisms and cocky style bring back memories of him as Barney on The Andy Griffith Show.  Perhaps the best scenes in this film are the shoot-outs between the sheriff and his one-eyed nemesis Rattlesnake (Jack Elam).  Something always happens on the count of three to prevent them from shooting each other.If you are worried about the violence of today's films, pick up a copy of Hot Lead and Cold Feet, sit down with the kids and rest assured knowing the harshest language you'll hear will be `gosh darnit.'  This is truly the wholesome family entertainment Disney is known for."
486,tt0077698,1,"Hot Lead and Cold Feet was one of the last comedy westerns that Disney made in the 70s, starring Don Knotts. Also starring Darren McGavin, Jack Elam and Jim Dale; who were essentially Disney regulars by this time. The story is quite interesting, about a town founder (played by Jim Dale) leaving his fortune behind to his two sons (both played by Jim Dale). The only problem, his son Billy doesn't know he has a brother, therefore competition for the inheritance. The film is filled with gags and funny lines, delivered by Don Knotts and Jim Dale mostly. Darren McGavin also plays a good villain in the form of Mayor Ragsdale. And the ending of the film has a twist, but watch to see. It's a great family film, no bad language or adult situations."
487,tt0078869,8,"With the advancement of movie technology today, I am awaiting a re-make of this film as I can see the enhancement of the Armageddon-like atmosphere of this movie.Even though this film came out on the heels of Star Wars I feel that for its time and its budget it was awesome and very much overlooked. I think in this case, being a Disney film, didn't help its image either. As a kid this movie scared the pants off of me. It was dark and menacing and there was the big black hole staring me in the face the whole movie. (I can still recall the extent of the willies this movie game me).While flawed I see this movie as an artistic and hard core science fiction classic. It uses many of what I see as key elements in science fiction - known science, theoretical science, possible futures, and our fear of the unknown (I personally think even with what we know, we still know very little about black holes).This movie was made in the feel of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea and Moby Dick, with the mad, yet brilliant captain, sailing a state of the art ship, knowingly, into certain and utter doom in the name of some idealistic obsession. And as it usually goes you have your idealistic yet rational unwilling passengers who want to get off the ship and survive the mad man's nightmarish dreams.The robots, while used in a highly symbolic fashion, were original in their concept and design. I particularly liked the way V.I.N.C.E.N.T. and B.O.B. were constructed as the ""avatars"" of humanity - completely man-made with human-like eyes and a ""soul"", that only allowed them to see the ""right"" side of things - as we see them. While on the other hand Maximilian was brilliant as the epitome of evil and twisted humanity in this movie - a man silently trapped and condemned to an inhuman fate as part of a mechanical nightmare.Lastly, I feel that the space backdrops and the internal renderings of the space ship, which I feel have somewhat of an impressionistic flair, are awesome and were very well done for the period. If you passed on this movie the first time I recommend giving it a second chance. Take in the movie - see its symbolism, its social commentaries and far reaching vision. I think some of the issues the movie quietly addresses are still relative today."
488,tt0078869,8,"The Black Hole was one of many films that were released with the intention of cresting the sci-fi wave created by the huge success of Star Wars (1977). More specifically, this was Disney's attempt at the genre and I think it was the studio's first movie that didn't go for a U certificate. The film that it can best be compared to is Star Trek: The Motion Picture, which was also released the same year. Both movies sport fantastic special effects and production values, while both also are surprisingly - and pleasingly - slightly left-field in their approach. Neither really fall squarely into the action/adventure bracket that Star Wars so obviously did, they rely more on atmosphere, some psychological aspects and have some enigmatic qualities which seem to indicate the influence of the earlier hard sci-fi masterpiece 2001: A Space odyssey (1968). For these reasons, I find both these films to be decidedly under-appreciated and interesting. The Star Trek franchise of course went down a different, more comforting route, from the second feature The Wrath of Khan (1982) onwards, while The Black Hole remained a one off that has become more and more obscure as the years go by. So much so that it could reasonably be considered a cult movie on account of its selective appeal.From the off, this is visually a very interesting film. It has great sets and model work, which make the giant space craft where the majority of the action takes place an evocative setting. The special effects throughout are in general very impressive and still look good today. But the visuals have been constructed for more than mere spectacle as they combine to create a pretty interesting atmosphere on the whole; they ultimately are used also to set up the strange and ambiguous ending which involves visions of Hell and an alternate universe. This kind of oddness stands out these days, as most big budget sci-fi endeavours mostly avoid such ambiguity, but this is definitely a plus point for The Black Hole. Another serious asset is the really effective main theme from John Barry. This is in all honesty one of his best bits of individual music, its sweeping yet mysterious and complements events on screen extremely well.The story itself is pretty simple and boils down to a deep space crew discovering a mysterious spaceship near a black hole, they board it and events escalate. The story is perhaps oddly presented in some ways as there is material quite obviously aimed at kids, like the cartoonish robots (the main one, V.I.N.C.E.N.T., being voiced excellently by Roddy McDowell) but at the same time there are also some decidedly sinister aspects to this one too. So I guess it had a bit of a split focus in some ways, not that that is a terrible thing but it may have accounted for its marginalised position in the sci-fi cinematic pantheon. But whatever the case, I consider this to be one of the best that 70's science fiction has to offer. It's mysterious and left-of-centre nature mean that it is one of the more interesting entries in the genre to revisit."
489,tt0081159,8,"Well I just discovered IMDb from my twin sister, Carol.  Carol and I played the ""Fat Identical Twin"" in Midnight Madness.  We didn't have to prepare much for the fat part, that came with us, and well and the rest was natural. ;)   It was our first major film role and we had a blast making it.  We were 21 at the time and lived about an hour and half from The Disney Studio in Burbank and the Hollywood, California area.  We grew up in front of the TV and probably some of the first generation of latch-key-kids.  Twenty years later, we still have lots of fun and are still 'heavy' or what ever is politically correct these days.  We don't pursue acting any more but have been know to 'come back' when the right opportunity arrives.  Carol is a Chiropractor in our home town of Southern California and I am in the Information Technology field in Georgia.I maybe bias, but I thought the film was cute, clean and fun.  We knew it wasn't a master piece or an Oscar nominee, however, it was and still is a movie the whole family can watch and have fun together.  It's nice not to have to worry if your young children can watch a video without having to fast forward certain parts.  And no one was more exited when it was released on video as Carol and I were.  Carol found it at Kmart for $6.99!  Now that's an inexpensive way to capture one's memories and share it with others.Sincerely, Betsy Lynn and Carol Gwynn; The Thompson Twins"
490,tt0081159,1,"They don't make movies like this anymore  though some may say that's a good thing.  Although this was amongst the first of Disney's PG rated films, it has more of the feel of the G films their studio turned out in the70s (i.e. ""Freaky Friday,"" ""The World's Greatest Athlete"") than the PG films that came out in the early 80s (i.e. ""Watcher in the Woods,"" ""Tron,"" ""Something Wicked This Way Comes""). Because of Disney's backing, ""Midnight Madness"" obviously had a large budget.  A huge cast and a ton of diverse locations go to show that.  But zaniness, a madcap scavenger hunt, and spectacular visual style weren't enough to save the film from being an enormous flop...  A failure at the box office, most of us were introduced to the film on HBO in the early 80s, back in the days when the same films would be shown 29 times a week (Oh, wait  they still do that!).  Essentially HBO did for this film what CBS did for ""The Wizard of Oz""  they created an enormous cult audience for a sugary-sweet mega-flop....The biggest problem that makes this a ""bad"" film is that there's too many characters and very few of them are fleshed out  Eddie Deezen's ""squad"" don't even have names!  The blue team, although they're the villains, are the most endearing and have the most work put into their characters (with the exception of the girl, who can't act & doesn't have enough to do). Harold, perfectly played to the hilt by Stephen Furst, is really the only one whose character is fully realized in the film.  The other standout character is goof-off Melio, played with tons of charm by now-director Andy Tennant.  Although then-Dr. Pepper spokesman David Naughton was supposed to be the star, his character often comes off obnoxious, particularly when pitted against his brother Adam, Michael J. Fox.  While everyone has favorite characters, I don't think anyone who loves the movie could disagree that Furst and Fox are the only two characters that you really learn anything about.Despite the film's many flaws and bad actors (most of whom fell off the face of the earth after this movie) it still works because the actors appeared to be having fun -- and fun on the set equals fun on the screen.  Come on, what college jock doesn't dream of floating around in a beer vat and what zoftig girl doesn't dream of stealing the show at the local discotech... er... I guess it would be at a rave nowadays...  Campy, squeaky-clean fun for anyone who was young in the 70s & 80s, it's only fitting that this has finally gotten the massive video release that it deserves.  But where the hell's the widescreen DVD release with the commentary, trailer and the full version of the song that plays in the disco?"
491,tt0081159,7,"Somewhere in the dark recesses of my brain cells a song plays in my head. I can't forget it no matter how hard I try. It's MIDNIGHT MADNESS and it's gonna get to you! Wish i could find a copy of this on a 45rpm record. Five disparate teams head out one night in L.A. for a scavenger hunt for clues instead of physical objects. An unkempt game-master with two gorgeous assistants is the mastermind of all this insanity that's about to be unleashed on L.A. All the teams are stereotypes (this movie being from 1980, before political correctness screwed everything up): the ""good guys"", the ""nerds"" led by Eddie Deezen, the dumb beer-loving ""jocks"", the ""we-don't-need-a-man-type ladies"", especially the redhead. The giggling twins are a scream, too. And finally, the ""bad guys"" with Stephen Furst as the leader. Furst is hilarious as the overweight slob Harold, whose attempt to use a computer to decipher the various clues leads to a gooey mess. Movies like this aren't made anymore. These days, movies have to have an ""edginess"" to them with some dark characters and other nonsense. Go back to the days when the ""good guys"" led by David Naughton were still good and not hopelessly conflicted. So dump all serious pretensions and go back to 1980. It's MIDNIGHT MADNESS . . ."
492,tt0081159,6,"It doesn't quite deserve the disproportionate number of ""10"" votes it's received on this web site, but ""Midnight Madness"" is still a lot of fun. The eccentric Leon (Alan Solomon) organizes a cross-city scavenger hunt for five groups of college students ranging from nerds and jocks to babes and good guys. Each team must decipher a series of clues (""Mr. Carson's obese male child"" leads to Johnny's Fat Boy Restaurant, and so on) before racing to the next location to do it again, all the while battling some occasional dirty tricks from rivals. The actual laughs few and far between, but you can't deny ""Midnight Madness"" carries heaps of cheesy '80s appeal. Look for Michael J. Fox (billed without the middle initial) in his film debut."
493,tt0081159,1,"WEEE this is still jolly good fun! As with most of my friends, we had seen this movie on HBO when we were young, and then had been searching ever since for a copy of it.

494,tt0080861,3,"This third and last theatrical sequel to the classic Walt Disney Production The Love Bug (1969) brought the enormously successful franchise about a magical Volkswagen to a screeching halt. Herbie deserved a better send-off.There's just no love left in the poor little disrespected cash-car. Filmed on the cheap in Mexico, this entry has none of the quality and charm of its original and trashes all that was good about the preceding sequels. Vincent McEveety, the weakest of Disney's three main directors during this period, was assigned the project after having done a fair job with Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo, but makes no effort to elevate the project above the level of its poor script. The frenetic, maudlin result is one of the worst Disney films. Talented comic performers Harvey Korman, Cloris Leachman and Charles Martin Smith are wasted on unfunny material. Only the clever stunt and effects work save this mechanical destruction derby from oblivion.The Love Bug was eventually revived for a brief TV series and made-for-TV movie, but Disney was flogging a dead V-Dub."
495,tt0080861,3,"Easily the weakest of the series, this is a film the Herbie franchise could have done without.  Having a child as the nominal lead in an essentially adult role is a surprisingly common motif in children's movies; surprisingly, because more often than not it fails to work and it certainly fails here.  Eight-year old taxi drivers?  I think not, not even in Mexico. Our Paco is more annoying than lovable and I found myself rooting for the villains instead.Clearly the writers are to blame for the mess - the cast is actually quite good, e.g. you cannot ask for much better villains than John Vernon, Alex Rocco and Richard Jaeckel, but they were fighting a loosing battle against a rotten script. The best asset of the film is Harvey Korman who shows the right spirit, and is given the freedom to act out his madcap humour.  Neither his routines nor his character fit very well into the story, but the story is so weak one does not care."
496,tt0080861,3,"Yanking a few scenes from this Herbie would have been smart. Rework the ""walk the plank"" into some other way to get the bug to it's destination. There are some very comical parts in this movie. Leachman and Martin Smith put character into the movie. The rest were along for the ride and you knew it. The villains were more smart and ruthless in this episode than others. However there were some real stupid moves that disagreed with this notion. The scene with the plane and the heavy gold disk was an insult to everyone's intelligence. Great care should be used to leave magic and mystery where expected (Herbie and Coincidence)but not go beyond the laws of physics in other parts of the production. Large gold objects rolling around inside a small aircraft will destroy it very quickly. Not much racing in this one either. I find my kids watch the other Herbie movies and this sits on the shelf"

What else do you call a movie when a Mexican child calls Herbie ""ocho"" ( he adds up Herbie famous number ""53""  and gets eight). Then this Mexican child does a horrible paint job and starts using Herbie to run a taxi service. In my humble opinion the only reason to watch this film is to see what sort cellouiod trash Disney was putting out before Michael Eisner took over."
498,tt0080861,1,I think the makers of the Herbie franchise must have gone bananas when they conceived this pile of garbage. Every character was reprehensible except the mousy doctor. Herbie goes out of his way to help a street thug while his new owners scam an old woman and her undeserving niece. Had the movie ended with Herbie being dumped into the ocean by the maniacal captain this movie would have had some redeeming quality. My kids actually asked me to take this move off because it was completely lacking in any entertainment quality. Disney should have followed this movie up with HERBIE GOES TO THE CRUSHER. The only saving grace this movie had was Harvey Korman as the insane captain of the ocean liner. Sorry I subjected my family to this sad ending to an otherwise fun and endearing movie series.
499,tt0080861,1,"Low Bottom Feeder final sequel to the Herbie the Love Bug series, the Spanish version albeit. This was playing on Turner Classic Movies channel yesterday and I still can't figure out how it got on there in the first place. Certainly not a classic but the exact opposite -total bomb. Even the title is stupid,the car goes bananas in every movie it's in however there is a scene in which Herbie is covered in bananas but it takes place near the end of the movie and lasts about 5 minutes. The plot involves a very irritating young Mexican boy ,bumbling crooks, a desperate pathetic Helen Roper type love starved slut played by Cloris Leachman and her niece, a goofy ships captain and two young typical guys who want to race the car. The young Mexican boy befriends Herbie who by the way never gets called Herbie except for one time in the beginning of the movie. The cars number is 53 so of course in Spanish 53 always means 5+3 ,stupid. Now we have the very irritating boy yelling ocho(Spanish for 8 at least 200 times in the movie). Come on ocho , ocho ocho. Good god I wanted to sew his lips shut. They race around the world on cruise ships and through ghetto South America , with Cloris Leachman trying to get into Harvey Korman's pants in these stupid subplot scenes which have nothing to do with the main plot of the movie and this is a Disney flick?. It gets even worse, why do some people think the bull fighting scene is funny etc, it's very stupid with the car holding a cape in its hood and driving around backwards with the bull chasing it ,meanwhile the people inside yell and scream and the kid yells toro ocho toro ocho ,, how can i keep watching. The kid also plays taxi driver and becomes the race car driver too , oh sure yeah ,disney was on something for this movie- most kids i watched it with when i was young were probably bored. In the end , a very bad irritating finale to the series. Harvey Korman is wasted in a role so beneath him its sick, he is like a stupid Captain Stubing love boat style with the worst most unfunny dialog(the writers should have been shot for the preschool humor), the rest of the cast chews scenery and the stupid horny Cloris Leachman overacting every time she looks Kormans way as if she thinks Korman would want anything to do with her gross come-ons. I've never liked her in anything shes been in, shes a terrible actress, how she won awards who knows. After the final scene ,we get treated to a very syrupy irritating ending song about friendship complete with a Spanish word thrown in every few verses like i bet you a banana mañana ,charro, amigo etc. Is this Spanglish? Oh and did i mention the above bananas are also sold by the kid to passersby, yeah id like to buy bananas that were touching a smelly rusty car and the fact they drove 600 miles in the hot sun with the bananas on the outside of the car. these little sub-scenes added no doubt to amuse small children and annoy parents. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone unless you want to turn your kids into numb minded dregs. Of course this may keep your 3 y/o amused for ten minutes while you run to the video store to shoot the owners for carrying this movie."

Herbie The Love Bug was a 1963 Volkswagen Beetle deluxe ragtop sedan painted in Volkswagen L87 pearl white. Under normal circumstances, the interior would be a matching white. However, Herbie's interior was painted a special non-reflective grey color so the camera and studio lights would not reflect . The actors seem to enjoy immensely , as Charles Martin Smith and Harvey Korman as a silly captain play of sympathetic manner and the mean-spirited villains performed by John Vernon , Alex Rocco and Richard Jaeckel are top notch . Colorful cinematography by Frank Phillips , being the only classic Herbie film to not be shot at the Golden Oak Ranch. Jolly soundtrack by Frank De val , Robert Aldrich's usual , including the lively leitmotif , usual in the Herbie's series. This is a delightful film , the original entry was ¨The love bug¨ by Robert Stevenson with Dean Jones , David Tomlinson and Buddy Hackett , followed by ¨ Herbie rides again (1974)¨ also by Robert Stevenson and starred by Ken Berry , Stefanie Powers and Helen Hayes ; it's followed by ¨Herbie goes to Montecarlo¨ with Dean Jones , Don Knotts and Julie Sommers ; followed by ¨Herbie goes bananas¨ (1980 , or Herbie Torero) by Vincent McEveety starred by Charles Martin Smith and Cloris Leachman , among others and a 1997-for-television-movie with Bruce Campbell and John Hanna and a TV series , the most part filmed by Stevenson and Vincent McEveety and usually starred by Dean Jones . Furthermore recent version starred by Linsay Lohan , Justin Long and Matt Dillon , being directed by Angela Robinson. This first version "" Love Bug ¨ results to be the best version , it is amusing story with lots of laughs but is a familiar film . The motion picture was professionally directed by Vincent MacEveety . He's an usual craftsman from Disney productions and a filmmaker of several TV episodes such as ¨Diagnosis Murder , Colombo , Pensacola , Airwolf , Dallas , Cimarron , Star Trek , Gunsmoke¨ and many others . This ¨Herbie goes bananas¨ is an amusing and engaging film with effective combination of primitive special effects , live action , adventure , fantasy and humor . The children will get a kick out of this typical Disney film ,it's a great fun to watch and there are loads of entertainment in this one . Worthwhile seeing , typical Disney slapstick , though isn't of the best in ¨Herbie¨ series ."
501,tt0080861,5,"I love Herbie - it's hard not to. However I can recognise how the four movies gradually get worse. This was the worst one. Now I'm not saying it was terrible, and I don't agree with a comment above that says ""make the kids watch something else"", but it was a disappointing effort.The Love Bug is by far the best, closely followed by Herbie Rides Again. Herbie Goes To Monte Carlo is OK, but Bananas is not very good at all. If you're not a fan of Herbie movies, you won't like this.5/10"
502,tt0080861,1,"Vincent McEveety directed this fourth entry that sees Pete(played by Stephen W. Burns) and D.J.(played by Charles Martin Smith) gain temporary possession of Herbie from Jim Douglas, and have plans to enter it in a Rio De Janeiro car race, but need financial backing, so enlist two women(played by Cloris Leachman & Elyssa Davalos) to help out, but get sidetracked by a crazy ship captain(played by Harvey Korman) who dumps Herbie into the sea(!) and then is rescued by an orphaned pickpocket, and pursued by a smuggling syndicate. Awful film is utterly unfunny, contrived, and pointless, not to mention stupid. Forgettable sequel, best forgotten, though a brief TV series followed."
503,tt0080861,2,"this movie is point-less, taste-less and most importantly Herbie-less! that's right his name is only spoken once in the entire film and his original paint job is only seen for half an hour of the movie. the movie just isn't as original or lovable as the others. and don't fall for it the way i did i ran around the internet for 13 hours(no wait i think it was 14) looking for a review that says this movie was a success but it is not a success it's barley even a Herbie moviewhat it is is a waste of time and money my advice:don't fall for this movie,skip this one, go right to Herbie:fully loaded"
504,tt0118842,8,"""Chasing Amy"" is a clever and engaging urban love story that just exudes with Kevin Smith's gritty humour. The film's examination of sexuality, and everything involved with it, doesn't for one second sound untrue, even when it makes sure that everything being pointed out is expressed frankly and colourfully. It's not everyday we get a story of a heterosexual man falling in love with a homosexual woman, and although the concept could easily have resulted in a disaster of a movie, ""Chasing Amy"" manages to layer everything almost flawlessly. There are no predictable pitfalls in this film, and nothing is wrapped up in a neat little package. We are offered a group of characters that are likable but flawed, who don't always get, or give, what we would usually expect. I have to say, I never knew what was going to happen next, it manages to be consistenly offbeat without being unrealistic. Ben Affleck and Joey Lauren Adams have incredible chemistry together, perfectly displaying all the emotional complications a relationship as eccentric as theirs would have. Jason Lee was also outstanding in his role of the vaguely jealous best friend. The only thing that bothered me about this film was there was too much YELLING!! and it was slightly uneven at times. But generally I liked it a lot, and I'm just thankful that Kevin Smith is producing such fine work like this, it is truly a refreshing escape from Hollywood's formulaic sap."
505,tt0118842,1,"""Chasing Amy"" has to be the best love story of 1997.  It was emotional, gripping, funny, sad, heartwarming, and had some great jokes.  How could anyone deny that this screenplay was anything less than original, or perfection.  Absolutely intoxicating.  The performances were right on and the writing was magnificent.  Kevin Smith is, without a doubt, one of the best new writers.  With this movie he goes to a whole new level.  ""Clerks"" was great, and I think I'm one of the five people that enjoyed ""Mallrats"", but ""Chasing Amy"" takes the cake.  Nothing else came even close that year. That movie should have made a star out of Joey Lauren Adams.  She gave the BEST performance in 1997 and was robbed of an Oscar nomination, as was the script.  The scene outside of the ice rink is more than enough to show just how good she was.  And anyone who can watch that ending, the you don't know if you should cry or jump for joy ending, and not feel something, is heartless.  The movie was great.  It is one of my personal favorites, and will always be."
506,tt0082406,1,"This is my favorite Disney movie of all time. It is, in my opinion, one of their finest. Why do I think so? First, I like its realism. It is not some fantastic fairy tale, nor is it some good-against-evil-good-eventually-triumphs story. There are no heroes or villains in this story. This lack of good and evil made the story and the characters seem more alive than the ones you usually see.I also like the message this movie gives. It is simple yet powerful. The two main characters wanted only the most innocent of things - friendship. Yet society couldn't allow this friendship to be. This movie tugs at your heart, and it doesn't stop tugging. And the realism didn't diminish any by the movie's close. The main characters' problems remained unresolved, yet each finished the movie in contentment. I feel that this lack of a ""everything's okie-dokie again"" finish like you see in traditional animated movies gave this story a powerful element.If you're looking for songs your children can sing over and over again, you've come to the wrong movie. Each song is sung in a flavorful yet discreet manner. Little orchestration. Yet if you're looking for memorable characters, you've come to the right movie. Each character is very well developed, motivated by true emotions and the things that the everyday person wants - love, food, companionship. Each character is vibrantly drawn, and this vibrancy is matched by the character's personality. I saw a real person within the animal. Nobody is created in an idealistic image.From realistic characters come a realistic story. Nothing felt written or hacked. Everything felt like it was supposed to happen. There was nothing outlandish about the entire story. And if you're looking for comedy, you'll find none. This is pure drama, yet it's drama that kids can easily understand. This movie had a story that seemed like it could've easily happened to the average person. This is a rare and endearing quality.Basically, I loved this movie for what it had, a heart of gold, but also for what it lacked, a traditional formula. If you're looking for a story with a difference and a bittersweet flavor, this is the movie for you! It is nice, quiet, yet provocative and emotional. To sum it up, it is good clean fun with a touch of heartache, a true drama!"
507,tt0082406,1,"The Fox and the Hound, one of Disney's forgotten treasures, I honestly don't know why this movie is more noticed by people. This is one of my favorite animated movies of all time, it's innocent, it's simple, it's lovely, and just a wonderful tale about the most unlikely pair becoming the best of friends. The Fox and the Hound, yeah, it does go a little overboard on the cuteness factor with baby Tod and baby Copper, but this is when Disney really did mean well and came up with such a sweet and wonderful story that is classic.After a young red fox is orphaned, he is adopted the Widow Tweed, she names him Tod. Meanwhile, Tweed's neighbor, a hunter named Amos Slade, brings home a young hound puppy named Copper and introduces him to his hunting dog Chief. Tod and Copper become playmates, and vow to remain ""friends forever."" Slade grows frustrated at Copper for constantly wandering off to play, and places him on a leash. While playing with Copper at his home, Tod awakens Chief. Slade and Chief chase him until they are stopped by Tweed. After an argument, Slade says that he intends to kill Tod at his first opportunity. Hunting season comes and Slade takes his dogs into the wilderness for the interim. Meanwhile, Big Mama explains to Tod that his friendship with Copper cannot continue, as they are natural enemies, but Tod refuses to believe her. Months pass, and Tod and Copper reach adulthood. On the night of Copper's return, Tod sneaks over to meet him. Copper explains that he is a hunting dog now and things are now going to be different between them.The Fox and the Hound is such a great movie, honestly if you don't like this film, I don't know what's wrong with you, but you need to get something checked because everything about this film is just wonderful. The songs, animation and characters are just lovely. Plus there are some fun jokes, I loved seeing Chief constantly chasing after Tod and then Slade runs over to Tweed's house to scream about the fox but she just kicks his butt and tells him to get off her property. This is such a great movie, I highly recommend you see it if you get the chance.10/10"
508,tt0082406,1,"Looking back as child having watched this film, it never struck me for anything more than fuzzy/singing/talking animals that pandered to all my childish wants and needs. After all, that's why you watched Disney movies as a kid, right? It's just what you did in your childhood.Now, watching it again, about to embark on adulthood and all that it entails, it really moved me. How Todd and Copper, a young fox and a hound were the best of friends. Todd having been taken in by a kindly old women and nursed backed to health while right next door, Copper, owned by a mean and bitter old hunter, is being groomed as hunting dog.Yet, like children, they don't judge. They don't know about the differences between each other and they don't care. They just want to play hide and seek. It is when they grow older that they realize that it was never meant to be. How sometimes societal rules can stamp out the most innocent of ventures. Much like becoming an adult, reality sets in. Life is unfair.It's a truly beautiful movie, for it's simplistic yet universal message and unlike the vast library of previous Disney inventions, as stated before, it lacks the happy ending. The proverbial feel good formula that is the frame work for all Disney movies. It's because of it's bittersweet delivery and surprising realism, that it's become a lifeline to my childhood that I will carry with me for as long as I live."
509,tt0082406,9,"Halfway through production, Don Bluth mutinees, taking most of Disney's best animators with him. Another bunch resign. One dies. Drawings are stolen. Production is delayed endlessly. You would think that if ever a Disney feature were destined for disaster, this was it. Instead, 'Fox and the Hound' is probably the best Disney animated feature of its generation. You could clear a space about 10 years either side of it before you ran into something that gave it serious competition.We start with an orphaned fox kit - pardon me as my jaw doesn't drop in amazement. There have been, what - TWO Disney films where both parents survive? And, well, he is adopted by an elderly widow named Tweed, he develops a friendship with a hunting dog owned by Widow Tweed's crochety neighbor, and he starts to grow up, and life suddenly becomes very difficult, dangerous, and emotionally complicated.I won't give it away, in case you haven't seen it, but for my money this movie has close to the saddest, most desolate, tear-jerking scene in any Disney film I can think of. But don't worry, it bounces back well and truly. This is a long way from being a morose film. In fact it's an excellent balance of drama, action, pathos and humour. My only minor complaint is that there are a couple of comic sidekicks in this movie that are pretty annoying and contribute just about nothing to the story.Coming after 'The Rescuers', 'The Fox and the Hound' might have been the start of a Disney resurrection, but perhaps Bluth's departure really was a body blow. As it is, 'Fox and the Hound' is a moment of beauty and brilliance in the otherwise pretty murky first 20 or so years after Walt's death.Although it didn't cause much of a stir at the time, it has developed a deserved base of loyal fans in the twenty-three years since it was made.The film tackles themes of conflicting loyalties, friendship, love, identity, and somehow does it with a minimum of schmaltz and a maximum of heart. It's one of Disney's best, and you owe it to yourself to see it.9 out of 10
Historical Note: Mickey Rooney plays the adult Tod, the fox in 'Fox and the Hound'. According to Rooney's 1991 autobiography, when he was 5 years old he wandered into an office at Warner during breaks between shooting in one of his child-star films, and introduced himself to a bloke who turned out to be Walt Disney, and who was in the process of drawing a new mouse character, who he decided on the spot to name after Mickey. It just tops it off nicely, doesn't it?"
510,tt0082199,1,"I love this movie. I grew up watching Condorman and I always think of it with fond memories. The special effects may not be the best; however, the movie is over two decades old, and I think the effects are quite adequate. Besides, the movie is not supposed to be realistic, but rather it is a comedy with action elements. It provides a window into what people worried about in the early eighties; Cold War espionage is a major part of the story. Overall, it is charming and is a feel-good movie. It has all the classic elements: good verses evil and boy meets girl. It is a quality family movie and I would recommend this film to all who are young at heart."
511,tt0082199,1,"If the best James Bond movie had a ""G"" rating, it might very well have looked liked ""Condorman"". It has all of the cool gadgets, world-wide locations, a sexy femme fatale, creepy Russain villains, and best of all, some of the coolest car and boat chase sequences on film. Keep in mind that this is a kids movie, so the humor level is elementary, but nonetheless funny. The acting is over-the-top and cartoonish, but regardlessly enjoyable. Everyone looking for a fun, fast-paced adventure movie should check out this movie."
512,tt0082199,8,"I grew up with this film and must have watched it at least 20 times and i still do sometimes.It stars michael crawford who takes his persona of frank spencer and adds an American accent as a cartoon artist who helps a friend who works for the CIA with a job.Anyhows this is merely an excuse for some fun with jokes and some really cool action sequences (the bit with the Porsche's is excellent) think james bond for kids.There is also a bit of romance but nothing to worry about, it really is just a great film for kids.(okay and adults)"
513,tt0082199,8,"I loved this film in the eighties. I used to own it on Betamax, but since VHS and DVDs took over the world, I lost my copy of Condorman somewhere along the way. Michael Crawford (better known for his hapless TV character Frank Spencer), plays a comicbook writer who gets recruited by the CIA.As improbably as that sounds, you're best just glossing over it, as thinking too deeply about anything you see will spoil the film further.It's just stupid, cheesy fun. I loved it as a kid, but I have to admit being a little disappointed at what was really in front of me all the time. I could still appreciate some of it. The gadgets were fun, but Frank Spencer... sorry, Woody Wilkins, can just be a bit annoying. His jokes aren't that funny and he isn't tough enough to carry off being an action hero. I know this is a parody of spy movies in general, but if you want a cheesier spy movie, just watch some of the later Roger Moore James Bond films.Yes, I loved it as a kid and others who have such nostalgic memories of it will probably get something out of it, too. However, it's unlikely to find a new audience nowadays. If you have an eight-year-old boy, he might like it, but anyone over the age of eight will feel pretty bored by it all.I'm giving it 6/10 because of how much I used to love it. By today's standards, it's probably no more than a 5/10.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/"
514,tt0082199,1,"Forget Ben-Hur.  Forget Casablanca.  Forget The Godfather.  Forget them all. Condorman is the greatest movie of all time.  The epic story of the larger-than-life hero Condorman, brought to life by comic book writer Woody, a common man.  When he is asked to partake in a secret mission of helping a beautiful Russian agent called ""The Bear"", but known passionately to Woody as Natalia, defect to the United States.  Things go awry when the evil Russian Krokov sends the deadly assassin Morovich and his deadly Prognoviach.  But just when Krokov thinks that ""the best kept secrets of Woodrow Wilkins can be found by any small child for the price of a tiny coin"", Woody uses one of his many disguises to fool Krokov.  An amazing boat escape is the climax of this epic.  So, order yourself a Triple Istanbul Express and sit back and enjoy the greatest single piece of art ever."
515,tt0082199,8,"Condorman,wow....the film that made a childhood. It was THE Easter/Summer/Christmas/Half Term movie of a generation. Back in the 80's this film was ALWAYS on TV in the UK. Now,you hardly see it, its a disgrace (to my knowledge the last time it was on was at 5am on a Saturday morning on BBC1).Kids today have no idea what their missing,this was superhero movie magic at its best.....no...really...it was. It starred Michael (Phantom,Some Mothers) Crawford as Woody, a comic book artist who turned into his creation (Conderman) in order to rescue the beautiful (when your 10) Barbara Carrera from the clutches of the evil Hannibal (played in ultimate OTT mode by Oliver Reed... What i find more upsetting is that this masterpiece isn't available for us in the UK (Video or DVD). So,why,with the current trend for making Comic Book movies at a high,does nobody take a chance and offer this classic a remake!! Think about it..its got to be better than Daredevil,The Punisher, Batman and Robin and as for Catwoman,don't get me started!!. Question is,who could replace the Wonderful Crawford,Reed,Carrera?? Well the part of Natalia (Carrera) could go to somebody like,umm,lets say Hilary Swank.........Hannibal (Reed),needs to be one mean SOB,so how about Vernon Wells (Bennett in Commando, bad guy,bad string vest,back moustache,perfick!) and last but by no means least the part of Woody Wilkins.....well Vin Diesel needs a Hit!!!! But i feel the acting part of the role may be too much for him, so lets get Jeremy Irons on board!!! COME ON Hollywood GET WITH IT!!!!!!"
516,tt0082810,1,"The movie Night Crossing captures the feelings experienced by the vast majority of East Germans during the period 1961-89. I lived in West Berlin during most of 1967 and travelled through The Wall into East Berlin on a weekly basis. Why? Excitement, crossing a border into a Soviet governed country, experiencing the smells and the feel of East Germany, which is why Night Crossing is excellent, it captures that very feeling, and it is exciting. I was arrested by the Vopos in Checkpoint Charlie and accosted by a man in his leather coat and dark glasses I am led to believe was Stasi. When I watch the movie I can smell cheap diesel and cooking oil, I can see the outdated vehicles, the drab clothing the public wore and the lacklustre produce in shop windows. It brings back memories of realising just how lucky I was to live in a free country. In 1988, I toured the DDR from East to West, North to South. East Germany had changed little since 1967. The Trabants, constantly breaking down, were still the main mode of private motorised transport, the shops still featured nothing much to tempt me, uniforms were still commonplace, but the people, the ordinary people were open and nice once you had gained their trust. Watch Night Crossing, it's as close to the truth as any movie you will see on divided Germany, even closer than two other favourites The Spy Who Came In From The Cold and Funeral In Berlin."
517,tt1104001,1,"Yes. I had watched this movie back in 2010 when I was in school. Didn't understand much, but I was blown away by the visuals.. But now watching in 2019, it all makes sense and the visuals are yet world class. This movie was ahead of its time.Worth watching!"
518,tt1104001,1,"TRON: Legacy is a literal misunderstood masterpiece & is one of the most intellectual, deepest science-fiction movies I've seen Disney produce - EVER! Let me explain:
Immediately, CLU has strong, deliberate similarities with Hitler - they both wanted to create ""the perfect system"" & viewed those in their society who were similar to themselves as superior, where individuals are only deemed valuable if they can be used to further implement & reassert the oppressive structures in place.In TRON, any program deemed useless or unfit for work is sent into ""the games"", where they're to be slaughtered for the amusement of less ""disposable"" citizens - disabled / programs unable to be ""rectified"" are lesser & have no place in this system CLU has created. It's as if those who cannot contribute, may rebel or show resistance cannot be allowed to exist & so only the obedient, functioning rectified ones remain.This is a symbolic representation of a fascist regime where those ruled under it are controlled by fear & intimidation - ""rectified"" programs are representative depictions of people who are brainwashed by a system & further explains why those who can't be are sent to their deaths. Any imperfection is prohibited & made an example of - uniformity is essential & total, unquestioning loyalty to the cause is expected. Again, noticeable connotations are made in order to reflect Nazi Germany; CLU commits genocide by wiping out the ISOs who represent / relate to the Jewish population within 'Legacy' & there's a resonant message of defiance throughout the film.It's also a metaphor for mental health - with CLU depicting the worst of humanity & what it's capable of when a mind is corrupted by power & greed, embodying the darkest side of ourselves. Additionally, on the opposite side, Kevin Flynn is in a state of depression when we first meet him again in the movie - he's been battling his demons & has given up, justifying his lack of action by saying ""the only way to win the game is by not playing"" but Sam Flynn challenges his problematic ideological attitude & his son visually journeys into the mind of his father (who hasn't been there for him throughout his childhood because he's lost himself inside his own head) in order to regain a relationship he missed out on as he was growing up in order to save him, battling his demons alongside him so he can bring him back out into the real world, teaching him that by resigning himself to what he deemed as inevitable, he only allowed the darkness inside the Grid (a metaphor for his mind) to grow & spread like cancer. These two themes intertwine when Sam goes against his father's wishes by fighting - sparking what would grow to become genuine character progression of Kevin.Sam meets other members of the resistance & begins to fight back & only when his life is in danger does Kevin realise that not only do his inner demons pose a risk to himself, but those he loves & others around him, so his supposedly harmless inaction is shown to have consequences, forcing his hand & beginning his journey of recovery. Hence - linking back to politics - it also signifies that the only way for a fascist state to thrive is when good people do nothing - they are complicit in the actions of CLU by allowing him to continue without resistance. Fascist states are vulnerable & fragile & when people rise up against them, they crumble. Hence, it reaffirms this point when CLU's plan is immediately jeopardized once people act.As Kevin & Sam battle corrupted programs & CLU, they head towards their escape - a light that shines brightly through the darkness at the end of a tunnel (another metaphor for depression). It's at this point when Kevin realises that the only way to save his son is by confronting his fears, face to face, coming to terms with who he is & what he's capable of, what kind of person he has the potential to be & makes a choice to embrace the light again instead of resigning himself to the darkness. He sees the danger he poses to those he loves if his darker self isn't stopped & so sacrifices himself, visually embracing his darker side (coming to terms with it) & overwhelming it with light in the ultimate show of love towards the child he never got to see grow up. By doing this, we're led to assume that he dies but he neutralises the threat & redeems himself in the eyes of his son. It's a total act of redemption; a father battling his depression & being trapped inside a prison of his own making for years - how those suffering are able to win if they accept help & don't fight the battles they have to face alone when there are those willing to support surrounding them.Kevin Flynn starts the story as powerless & concludes as powerful. It's about family & incorporates socio-political themes brilliantly. Even more genius, CLU didn't understand humanity & that's poetically what saves it - he was unable to understand that there is no such thing as ""perfection""; it's subjective & thus his system is ironic due to the basic flaw in what is supposed to be perfect. It shows how easy it is to topple such a regime once that flaw is exposed; it's a weakness - not a strength - & individuality is what makes a society strong; CLU's misguided idea about this ultimately leads to his demise. He doesn't understand because he's made himself into less of a reflection of humanity than intended, so can't foresee what his opponent Kevin will do for love as love isn't a concept he considers or acknowledges due to his lack of humanity. He's absolved himself of any trace of it in order to become ""perfect"" but it's a pathetic fallacy.The darkest side of humanity acts upon irrational thoughts, sometimes selfish or cowardly & sometimes from an unintentional misinterpretation of unclear information. Once we look at things from an objective point of view, we see the cracks in the logic & only upon self reflection can we change ourselves for the better. We're reminded of that here.Not to mention, it's worth noting the beautiful direction from Joseph Kosinski (unbelievably, his first ever feature film!?) - who does an astounding job of crafting such a subtextually rich tale - & appreciating the faultless, sleek, stylised visuals - honestly, jaw-droppingly GORGEOUS & effective cinematography from Claudio Miranda - who leaves you in awe of the aesthetic & his meticulous use of light while watching & visually, it's undeniably one of the most iconic, inventive & distinctive movies I've ever seen with groundbreaking visual effects, world building that's phenomenally immersive from the moment you step foot within it - with masterful, artistic hair & make-up, sound & costume design & additionally, production design - as well as the electrifying score by musical legends Daft Punk who craft one of the best soundtracks for any movie in history... TRON: Legacy was a gift to all who've been longing for an original sci-fi franchise & most of y'all slept on it. It's an utter travesty."
519,tt1104001,8,"It's not highly likely to win many new converts, but for those who already like the original and want to see more of that world, it more than satisfies. The visuals are a wonderful evolution from Tron and the story of a father and son who have to make up for lost time is very touching. The CGI face they developed for Jeff Bridges is not perfect, but it works very well with just a few exceptions and I feel, for my own tastes, that they have actually bridged the uncanny valley with this one. Still a bit of work to get it perfect, but this one works as it is. Oh, and the score by Daft Punk is beautiful. The first thing my brother and I did after leaving the theater was buy the sound track on the way home. It's very suggestive of the original but with plenty of today's newer sensibilities mixed in."
520,tt1104001,9,"This is the one sequel I actually like. More correctly, I love it.This work of art is gorgeous to look at, has an apprropiate soundtrack and the morale of the film is amazing (hint: companies like Microsoft won't like it) or one can just watch and enjoy the original story."
521,tt1104001,9,"Everything about this film works. The visuals, writing, acting, everything. There are very few wrong things I can find with Tron, especially the soundtrack which is timeless even almost a decade later. I still remember watching this film in theaters and not regretting it at all. I highly recommend this film for fans of anything quality.From the pacing to the cinematography this film is astoundingly well made, and truly deserves more recognition. It is timeless in every meaning of the word."
522,tt1104001,7,"The original movie was generic. While it's far from bad, it's plot was simplistic in terms of the overall focus being on the good vs evil side and less on the thematic element it established of Flynn and all users being gods. It serves as a mythology, however, to a much more insightful legend which unfolds in this movie. But the problem is, due to the somewhat simplistic nature of the predecessor, people failed to give attention to the themes of this film, preferring to focus on the generic side as that's what they'd expect from a Tron movie. But the movie doesn't stay generic, so when viewers find nothing simple to see they assume the movie is empty. It's not, they're minds are just preset to look for simple ""turn off your brain and be entertained"" values, which simply aren't present in this film.The whole movie, just like the original, is similar to the idea of a religious mythology. The original featured programs as disciples of the users, enslaved for their belief. But that plays a small role overall. Here, when the Grid is reprogrammed to the image of Kevin Flynn, Flynn is established to the status of ""the one true god"" at least of this version of the grid, and all the other users who contribute new programs are just angels. But the maker of this world is Flynn, regardless of whether or not he writes the fates of these people. So, much like the original Hebrew form of god, he is not so much a ruler who demands worship or enforce any rules but just a wise and experienced being here to help when he's needed.And it's not so much an analogy to call Flynn god as it is TRUE. He has successfully created a world, not a platform. A world that's self sustaining and requires no more intervention of the users, as displayed by the ISOs which created themselves and were programmed by no-one.And this demands many questions! If they'd been allowed to live, would the ISOs have made this world like our own in thousands of years? Does this mean that's how our own god could have created our own world and how we came to be? Questions of such layered nature can't simply be ignored as style over substance.And then there comes CLU, the best friend of Flynn who he trusted. But as god, I dare say it, may have been somewhat confused in his image he had for the world in his early form, so did Flynn suffer from this same confusion of image for his world. This causes CLU to suffer a similar fate of uncertainty, making him only able to understand that his god is incapable of creating a perfect world since he can't imagine one. Thus, taking matters into his own hands, he abandons his god and does what he sees to be right. But the problem is he expects to get a different result with the same thinking as his flawed god, the only thinking he has been exposed to, and makes even worse mistakes than his god, making Flynn see the errors of his ways. Thus, a most appropriate analogy, CLU becomes the Satan to Flynn's god.But the ultimate piece of symbolism that outmatches anything else in the movie, is the final attempt of CLU to get Flynn's disc. He realizes Flynn has tricked him, by giving the disc he sought to his son. He discovered that the son of Flynn, and thus the son of a god, has obtained the disc and power he seeks, and thus he must obtain it. There is so much symbolism that flies past viewers in what happens next. When CLU realizes he has been tricked, he raises his disc to derez Flynn and then go get the right one, but only violently places the disc beside Flynn, subtly showing in the end he still considered Flynn his friend and could not bring himself to kill him. CLU runs to obtain this disc from the obstacle stopping him from having the ultimate power, showing the rivalry between the Satan and savior of this world.Such themes like this show the filmmakers truly put a lot of thought into their creation, not a lack of it, so people need to stop discrediting them and their work."
523,tt1104001,8,Great great movie always get chills from the music and when he first uses the bike. Love the atmosphere of Sam Flynn's life and how much love he has for his father at the end of the movie. Fantastic message in the movie where we as people think things are important in our life such as work or possessions but nothing is more important then family 👍.
528,tt0084783,7,"The story is of two teenage brothers living together on a small property in Bixby, Oklahoma (a small town about twenty miles south of Tulsa). Tex (Matt Dillon) is the younger and Mason (Jim Metzler) is the older. Their mother is dead and their father rarely shows up. The brothers are doing everything they can to avoid the clutches of social services. The dynamic of their relationship is one of frustration, love, and anger. Their lives are not easy and money is running out. To buy food and get the lights back on Mason is forced to sell Tex's horse and of course that infuriates Tex and he takes off in a rage. The poignant scene that has Mason drive his pickup along the road to coax Tex back is an early scene that establishes the tone of the relationship between the siblings.It is not clear where this story will go. There are some moments along the way where it looks like Tex is going to take a very wrong turn when in the company of a drug dealing friend. The young Dillon and Metzler carry the movie by their natural performances; the kids talk and act like most kids of their age did in that place and time (early 1980s). The fact that the movie was filmed on location in Bixby and Tulsa adds to the feeling of authenticity.This movie does not go beyond the scope of being a simply-told, affecting tale and, within that scope, it delivers admirably. Some sentimentality creeps in toward the end, but for what it is I found this modest movie satisfying."
529,tt0086476,1,"Margot Kidder is unstoppable. She will always be there when you need to be entertained.  This film was one of the Disney film which were made to change the image of the company. Needless to say by the films controversy, it did.Kidder is ambitious, hard edged writer on her way to write her first big mystery novel, when she stumbles upon Hayes, a lier and fraud, who turns out to be working for... Leave that up to audiences. Kidder falls upon a real plot of terror and adventure when she is kidnapped and taken to a hotel where murder and mayhem ensues. Then things get really ugly. Hayes and Kidder have great chemistry together. Intellect and acting makes up for some lulls earlier on in the film, and when you see the ""Club scene"" with ""Princess Aida""... Laughs and even a bit of tension highlight this film with strange yet watchable locations, and bit of Italian! 8/10"
530,tt0086476,8,I can't understand why this movie has such a low User Rating. I enjoyed it thoroughly the first time I saw it and have seen it again several times with no loss of pleasure. Perhaps some viewers failed to realize that this is not a serious thriller but a tongue-in-cheek romantic comedy in disguise. Taken on these terms it's a lot of fun.
531,tt0086476,8,"I saw this film many years ago and loved it immensely...much better than the current ""Stranger than Fiction"" which follows a similar theme. My question now is, ""When is it coming out on DVD???"" This is one film I would purchase in a flash and I'm a bit disappointed that it has not yet been released on DVD and even the VHS release has been out of print, so to speak, for many years. Time to write Disney again! The coupling of Margot Kidder and Robert Hays is brilliant and the intrigue is captivating. The tension builds when Kidder's ""novel"" ends up in police evidence files and is taken literally but all along the banter between hers and Hays' roles is delightful. A definite keeper!"
532,tt0086476,8,"I think that putting this movie under the Disney label even with controversy surrounding it was a good move. That is just what the studio needed at a time when people were straying away from the usual cutsie ""Disney"" movies, like ""The Rescuers""(1977), or even ""petes Dragon""(1977) for that matter. This is more of an adult centered film, and that is what makes it special. Parents will enjoy this film more than their kids. But any children watching this film under about the age of 12 or 13, SHOULD have parental guidance, because the film does have some suggestive content. Over all, I gave it 8/10, mostly for the story line and character situations. It was GOOD!!!"
533,tt0086476,6,"I wasn't aware of the Disney studios' involvement in the production of ""Trenchcoat"" until I read about it; the final result certainly has few Disney-ish touches. It's more of an 1980s update of classic ""innocent caught in an exotic adventure"" films like ""Charade"". Of course Robert Hays and Margot Kidder are not Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn, but anyway - Kidder is charming and her body language shows that she has a knack for physical comedy, while Hays is a little bland yet adequate. And there is an extra bonus for fans of the long-running ""Poirot"" TV series: a young-looking David Suchet appears (only in the first half, though) as a Maltese police inspector, with voice mannerisms that will sound very familiar to anyone (like me) who has closely followed his ""Poirot"" interpretation through the years. This inspector, by the way, is pretty much the only important character who really is who he claims to be in this twisty tale. The Malta locations are not outstandingly captured, but they're pleasant enough. Forget any possible Disney prejudices and watch this one. **1/2 out of 4."
534,tt0086476,8,"If you liked Margot Kidder as Lois Lane in Superman - and Robert Hays in Airplane - you'll like them together in a charming, funny, well-plotted mystery set in Malta.The movie does have some twists and turns - and suspense and danger for Kidder's character - but at no point does it cause one to forget that this is a captivating fun film with two lead actors who really like each other - the romance seems very natural.Kidder and Hays are also so good looking! :)
If you liked Romancing the Stone and its sequel - you'll like this - it's VERY similar in premise - equally charming - but Robert Hays and Margot Kidder are more easy going, less intense than Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner."
535,tt0086476,6,"Once upon a time, people knew who they were. Some were mechanics, some were politicians, some were writers.Since about 1980, the real writers have been removed so that the rich tea party families could ""write on the side"".That's why we had so many ""situational tea party type Miss Marple comic murder mysteries"", comic fantasies purely going with formula.There is no ""writing"" here. It is formula stage play. It is a mixture of ""Romancing the Stone"", ""Miss Marple"", and virtually every stage comedy one has ever seen.Then again, all good cinema begins as good stage plays, so you have at least a mediocre movie here.What helps here is great casting. Margot Kidder is a bit like Lois Lane here, only more likable. She shows that comedy is her forte, and the role seems to have been written specifically for her.This is probably what Kidder should always have done. The rest of the cast is also splendid.In a formula film like this, casting makes a big difference. It's lightly likable, with the cast pulling it up over the 5/10 mark."
536,tt0086476,3,"The only reason I decided to check this one out was because it’s set in Malta; the result, however, was an exceedingly feeble comedy-thriller from, of all people, the Disney stable and, needless to say, a long way behind Hitchcock.Incidentally, this was the film which forced the studio to open a parallel label – Touchstone – so that they could make more adult-oriented fare: its few moments of violence and the appearance of a man in drag, presumably, were the offending elements in this regard! The title is the typical outfit worn by the detective hero of 1940s film noirs: here, it’s incongruously donned by the irritating would-be thriller novelist Margot Kidder(!) – while the boyish-looking Robert Hays is the typical undercover agent (whose mission is to catch a ring of plutonium-traffickers). I can’t say the script-writers/film-makers were particularly inspired by the Maltese locations – so much so that it could have been set practically anywhere else to much the same dismal effect (it’s simply not thrilling and certainly not funny)! Most of the other characters are seen either aiding or harassing the two leads – sometimes they seem to be doing one when their intention is actually the opposite; these include clumsy assassin Leopoldo Trieste, laid-back police chief David Suchet (TV’s future Hercule Poirot!), a couple of sweet old lodgers at Kidder’s hotel, a German mystery woman, and a Sicilian stud. A notable appearance is put in by John Justin (yes, the hero of the classic Michael Powell/Alexander Korda THE THIEF OF BAGDAD [1940] in what amounted to his last feature-film role!) as the long-suffering aristocratic owner of the hotel, whose place is turned upside-down by the end of the film. By the way, I only spotted two Maltese actors of stature in bit roles – one played a guide at a museum, and the other a fishmonger who helped Kidder evade her pursuers in one scene.For what it’s worth, the identity of the villains is ingenious (if not exactly original); in the end, though, in spite of a number of chases, the film is never as engaging (or enjoyable) as it should have been…and only manages to give a bad name to the genre it’s playing at, not to mention the people and country involved!"
612,tt0211181,5,"unfortunately,this second live action film is a pale imitation of its predecessor.it's a lot slower,and the story feels contrived.it almost seems like filler to me.there are a few comic moments,though not as many as its predecessor.i think they should have left it at the first one,101 Dalmatians.Glenn Close returns as Cruella De Vil,and is good,but has much less to do this time around.plus,her two henchmen form th preventions film are not in this one,and they added some comic relief.Gerard Depardieu is in this one,in a completely ridiculous role,and he looks quite silly,to be polite.despite its problems its still watchable.my vote for 102 Dalmations is a 5/10"
537,tt0086476,4,"The descriptors ""simple"" and ""uninspired"" apply to both this film and its title. It's the story of a stenographer who flies to Malta to write a mystery noir novel during her two week vacation. While there, she inadvertently comes into contact with nefarious elements.Unfortunately, ""Trenchcoat"" has no charm, no intrigue, no artistic value. Margot Kidder--playing the wannabe writer--looks like she is doing a walk-through. Reportedly she did not get along with the director.The direction and everything else about the film feels amateurish. The only thing that could make it worse would be a laugh track. The main problem is the script, which offers very little that is original. Its main approach seems to be putting the ""heroine"" in dangerous circumstances and having her lament that no one believes her. Not funny, unless maybe the actress is someone who is intrinsically funny.Avoid this stinker."
538,tt0086336,1,"It was almost too much to hope that someone would make a movie version of Ray Bradbury's outstanding fantasy novel 'Something Wicked This Way Comes' that did justice to it, but director Jack Clayton did. He and his cohorts managed to capture all the dark, ominous portents and mysterious, mystical happenings that fill Bradbury's book.Set earlier in this century, a carnival comes to a small town at a strange time of year, October. But then it's a mighty strange carnival, one that fulfills the fantasies--and fears--of the town's residents. Two young boys, Will Halloway and Jim Nightshade (Vidal Peterson and Shawn Carson) find out the foreboding and forbidden secrets of the carnival, as does the tired, prematurely old man (Jason Robards) who is Will's father.As has been noted, there probably isn't another film with the Walt Disney name on it that is as dark as this one. It may be too frightening in parts for very young children and too disturbing at times for slightly older ones. A person's enjoyment of the film would be helped considerably by reading the book beforehand, much like Kubrick's '2001...' Besides those already mentioned, some of the good performances in the movie come from Royal Dano, James Stacy, and Jonathan Pryce as Mr. Dark."
539,tt0086005,1,"I have loved this movie since the first time I saw it over 15 years ago. But as I have read through numerous reviews,  I find them missing a few elements that make this movie so wonderful.There are two subtle elements of wilderness, that unless you have experienced them, you will probably miss in the movie, silence and melancholy.When one experience solitude and wilderness as Tyler does,  the first thing you notice is the  silence that surrounds you.  The only noises that can be heard are the ones you make, and simple actions like scratching your hand, striking a match, or the rustle of  your nylon parka as you simply move all become a symphony of noises you never noticed before.The director, Carroll Ballard,  takes great pains to illustrate this in the beginning of the movie( knowing all the while most viewers will miss these subtleties)  as Tyler is left on the a frozen lake with all his gear strewn about.  Rosie  guns the engine to his plane for the third time and finally gets to takes off.  The sound of that single engine plane is deafening and overpowers everything within 25 miles, but the silence Tyler is left with as the last throb of the plane's engine disappears in the distance is even more so. All of Tyler's actions at this point center around the noise they make. Notice this when you watch.The next element of wilderness and solitude  the director so painstakingly portrays is melancholy.  There is no better way to describe it. Melancholy is an intangible, an emotion, yet for any who have experienced wilderness on the level that Tyler does knows how overwhelmingly real it is. It is palpable. The melancholy not only comes from within but comes from all around.  It is an element of wilderness that is there even if man is not.The scene that best depicts this melancholy is when Tyler is out sitting on the rock, alone, with only creatures of the tundra to keep him company. It is twilight.  His hair and glasses are wet from an earlier snow, and he sits and plays his oboe.  Not a song but a phrase, an echoing phrase that sings out  his loneliness to the empty expanse.  And off in the distance is a kindred reply, the howl of a lone wolf, a cry that says I know, I understand.Never Cry Wolf is a tremendous film and is equally underrated.  In one sense it is a master piece, one that will never receive mass appeal or recognition.  It speaks to us on multiple levels and with subtle intensity, but  unfortunately most of us  aren't able to hear the message."
540,tt0086005,1,"I remember when this movie came out I had no interest in seeing it. I thought it was a Disney kid's movie and basically forgot about it for years. About a year ago I caught it one night on cable and began to watch it. I immediately knew that I was seeing a great film, it was obvious within 5 minutes. Since I caught it in the middle and had missed the beginning, I decided to not ruin it and I turned it off with the idea of renting it the very next day, which I did.""Never Cry Wolf"" is a beautiful and breathtaking film about a biologist who travels alone to an extremely remote part of The Yukon in order to live with white wolves, and study their behavior. Charles Martin Smith, who I've always felt is an under-rated actor (see ""The Untouchables"" and ""Starman"") gives an unforgettable performance. The cinematography is spectacular, the music is superb, and the message is subtle and haunting.One of those rare films that can easily be rewarding for adults and kids. ""Never Cry Wolf"" is a true classic in every sense of the word, I would give it a 10 out of 10 and I do not throw the ""classic"" word around lightly. Do not miss this film."
541,tt0086005,8,"This fictionalization of the Farley Mowat book about his Arctic adventures studying wolves is amazingly enough perhaps the most controversial film Disney studios ever made. How sad is that? The reasons for the controversy would seem minor: first, the movie is not entirely true to Mowat's book; two, it's lightly plotted; and three, a man is seen running around naked in the tundra. To which I say, so what? so what? and gee, how offensive. (Maybe they should have clothed the wolves.)The latter complaint is the major reason for all the ranting by some ""reviewers."" To them a Disney film showing human nakedness seems a sacrilege and they want their bowdlerized world returned to them, and they want Disney censured and made to promise never to do anything like that again! The complaint that there wasn't enough tension in the film is also off base since this is a contemplative, even spiritual film, not a slick thriller. People with sound-bite attention spans who need to mainline exploding cars and ripped flesh to keep them interested need not apply.The criticism that Director Carroll Ballard's film is not entirely true to the book is legitimate, but I would point out that movies are seldom if ever entirely true to their source material. A film is one kind of media with its particular demands while a book is another. It is impossible to completely translate a book into a movie. Something is always inevitably lost, but something is often gained. Here the cinematography and the beautiful musical score by Mark Isham are fine compensations.The acting by Charles Martin Smith as ""Tyler"" (Farley Mowat) and Brian Dennehy as Rosie, the exploitive redneck bushpilot, and Samason Jorah as Mike the compromised Inuit (who sells wolf skins for dentures) and especially Zachary Ittimangnaq as Ootek, the quiet, wise man of the north are also pluses. Note how compactly the main issues of the film are exemplified in these four characters. Indeed, what this film is about is the dying of a way of life, not just that of the wolves, but of the Inuit people themselves who are losing their land and their resources while their young people are being seduced away from what is real and true and time-honored for the glittering trinkets of the postmodern world. This is a story of impending loss and it is as melancholy as the cold autumn wind that blows across the tundra.What I think elevates this above most nature films is first the intense sense of what it would be like for a lower forty-eight kind of guy to survive in a most inhospitable wilderness, and second the witty presentation of some of the scenes. Ballard works hard to make sure we understand that it is cold, very cold and desolate and that there are dangers of exposure and weather and just plain loss of perspective that have killed many a would-be adventurer and might very well kill Tyler. I think it was entirely right that near the end of the film we get the sense that Tyler is going off the deep end emotionally, that the majestic and profoundly melancholy experience has been too much for him.Tyler begins as a greenhorn biologist dropped alone onto a frozen lake amid snow covered mountains rising in the distance so that we can see immediately how puny he is within this incredibly harsh vastness. The following scene when Ootek finds him and leaves him and he chases Ootek until he drops, and then Ootek saves him, gives him shelter, and leaves again without a word, was just beautiful. And the scenes with the ""mice"" and running naked among the caribou and teaching Ootek to juggle were delightful. The territorial marking scene was apt and witty and tastefully done. (At least, I don't think the wolves were offended.)This movie was not perfect, however. For one thing, those were not ""mice"" that Tyler found his tent infested with. I suspect they were lemmings posing for the cameras. Those who have seen the film about the making of this movie undoubtedly know what they were; please advise me if you do. Also the ""interior"" of Tyler's tent was way too big to fit into the tent as displayed. Also it would be important from a nutritional point of view for Tyler to eat the ""mice"" raw as the wolves did! (The actual creatures that Mowat ate I assume were mice.) If Tyler had to exist purely on roasted and boiled rodent for many months, he would encounter some nutritional deficiencies. Still, eating a diet of the whole, uncooked mouse would be sustaining whereas a diet of lean meat only would not. (Add blubber and internal organs for an all-meat diet to work.) Incidentally, the Inuit people get their vitamin C from blubber and the contents of the stomachs of the animals they kill.Where were the mosquitos and the biting flies that the tundra is infamous for?Since this movie appeared almost twenty years ago, the public image of the wolf has greatly improved and wolves have been reintroduced to Yellowstone Park. I think everybody in this fine production can take some credit for that.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon!)"
542,tt0086005,1,"This film is not a typical Disney movie; so much so that you wonder why they did it. The simple good-evil storyline common to most Disney movies does not exist here. All characters have a different motive, and all are convinced of their own morality. What's more, they convince you. You see the issue of enviornmentalism in Alaska from all sides; and even if you may not agree with everyone, you can at least see it from their perspective. In the end however, the message is far more simple and it is tough to argue with.Another trait that immediately stands out about this movie is its striking rawness. For a good part of the film, the main character narrates, and one gets the feeling he's writing home, as opposed to telling an audience. This adds both an intimacy and a sincerity and is very effective.Though it is largely unknown (and therefore largely under-appreciated), Never Cry Wolf is a beautiful, complex and forceful. A high point for Disney -- no contest."
543,tt0086005,1,"""Never Cry Wolf"" is a good reason why I like the movies.  Human characters, compelling story, warm humor and breathtaking scenery (with the Atlin area in Northwestern British Columbia filling in for Alaska) combine to make it a favorite of mine.""Tour de Force"" doesn't seem quite the right turn of phrase for Charles Martin Smith's performance as the scientist Tyler for such a low-key character but he is the heart of the movie.  It's especially noticeable when I associate Mr. Smith as Toad in ""American Graffiti"".  His scene with the wolves and caribou is amazing and primal.Samson Jorah is marvelous as the Inuit Mike (""He says, 'Great idea!'"")What a treat it is to watch compared to all the noise and quick-cut editing that dominate modern movies."
551,tt0088814,7,"""The Black Cauldron"" is not a typical Disney animated feature.  For one thing, it's not a G-rated musical.  In fact, it was the first-ever Disney feature to receive a PG rating.  The story comes from the works of Lloyd Alexander, in the spirit of J.R.R. Tolkien.  In it, Taran, a young pig-keeper must protect Henwen, a prophetic pig who can divine the whereabouts of a powerful weapon known as the Black Cauldron.  The demonic Horned King is after this bastion of black magic to create an invincible army of the undead.  This movie boasts impressive art shot in 70mm widescreen format, art which includes the contributions of a young Tim Burton.  Sadly, this feature did poorly in theaters, possibly being too frightening, or going over the heads of Disney's usual target audience. Just the same, ""The Black Cauldron"" deserves a good look!"
552,tt0089385,1,"In what may be the most remarkable live action film to come out of the Disney studios during the 80's or even the 70's for that matter, I find the treatment it has received from it's own studio appalling.  The best thing I can compare it to is having a ruby but discarding it because you only prefer diamonds.  Considering all the costume jewelry Disney released in the aforementioned decades, you would think they would have more respect for this gem.I'm sure parents who took their children to see Natty Gann when it was released were surprised and shocked to discover that it was not a film for younger children.  It is a very dark realistic film which takes place during the Great Depression.  This is not only the story of a young girl traveling across country to find her father, it is the story of people searching for hope and trying to survive in an age when just having food on the table was a constant struggle.  When Natty's father Sol(Ray Wise) is offered a job in a logging camp in Washington, he is only given a few hours to come to a decision, either take the job and leave Natty behind, or stay in Chicago with Natty and hopefully find work elsewhere.  At first, rejecting the job offer, he steps out into the Chicago streets.  In a truly remarkable scene, we see as Sol does, the faces of all those who have lost hope and been beaten down in despair.  It is after this brief but telling moment that he realizes, as we do, there is no decision to be made and Sol accepts the work in Seattle. Sol is forced to leave Natty in the care of a boarding house owner Connie(Lainie Kazan). After Natty overhears Connie reporting her as an abandoned child, she decides not to wait for her father to send for her, and begins an arduous journey across country to find him.If ever there was a film that is a picture of contrasts it's this one. Early in the film we are given the harsh reality of depression era Chicago. Director Jeremy Kagan does not spare us from the details.  We watch as men stand hopelessly and helplessly praying and hoping for work.  There is a scene where a destitute family are evicted from their home.  Later, as Sol is heading to Washington in the bus, we see another family on the road with their meager belongings strapped to their car as they head west, their car no longer operable.  As Natty walks through the market place vendors sell what meager belongings they have just to get buy.  When Natty runs away we see her fishing for food out of a trash can for a morsel to consume.  Later, as Natty travels westward, there is beautifully photographed scenery of forests and mountains, but Director Kagan astutely reminds us of the bleakness of the depression with many scenes of the struggle in rural America, ranging from a scene of a farmer and his much pregnant wife plowing a field, to scenes of orphaned and abandoned children left to be wards of the state.   This is not your Daddy's Disney, kids.  Dick Bush's cinematography of the wilderness is breathtaking, yet in the scenes set in Chicago and in the farm towns of America, he mutes his colors to enhance the contrast between beauty and desperation.  When Natty jumps her first train, she is help and befriended by Harry(John Cusack), who is also riding the rails.  Cusack in his first major dramatic role after being extremely good in The Sure Thing, shows for the first time that he is not just a comedic actor, but has dramatic prowess as well. Harry may be young, but Cusack gives him the edge of a man aged beyond his years.  It is an uncanny performance.Salenger, as Natty, is more than just a teenage actress. Her characterization draws us into the story from the first moments of this film to the last.  It is the key that holds this film together and if it had been put into less capable hands the film would surely not have succeeded as well.  Although her film career since Natty Gann has not been noteworthy, you will always remember her for her unflinching portrayal of Natty Gann. This is a journey for the ages, and one you will not soon forget. Unfortunately.......I don't make it a habit to comment on the DVD release of films, but in this case I'll make an exception.  The transfer of this wonderful film is appalling.  It's bad enough when a film that shouts ""wide screen"" is only released in a very horrid poorly done pan and scan, but the full screen transfer is one of the worst if not the worst I have ever seen.  It gives new meaning to the word grainy.  At times the picture jitters so that you may begin reaching for your VCR remote to adjust the tracking until you remember this is a DVD.  There are signs of the film's age running rampant throughout and no visible effort to clean it up digitally or otherwise.  I'm not one to believe every film should come with a boatload of extras, and have no problem if a studio wants to give us just the film, but there is absolutely no excuse for the poor picture quality of this DVD.  This movie is a gem, and for the Disney studios to tarnish it and treat it in this unconscionable manner, saddens me terribly.  What is more frustrating is the fact that Disney can do quality video releases, so just a decent film to DVD wide screen transfer would not have been a lot to ask for.  They should be ashamed of what they have done to this fine fine film.My Grade: Journey of Natty Gann-A
DVD transfer - F"
544,tt0086005,8,"This is a good autobiographical movie which raises interesting issues about the preservation of wildlife and the necessary role of the wolf in the ecosystem of the north.  Charles Martin Smith (American Graffiti) ""Farley Mowat/Tyler,"" reminded me of my husband when he was in graduate school and had to do field research. Typical of graduate students, they are so excited about the project that they don't analyze the difficulties and the ways of doing their stuff. I highly recommend the movie even though the movie makers modified the book. The wolves are not killed nor did the bush pilot bring in Japanese investors to build a resort in the book. What a relief!  I like movies done in different locations about preservationists, they always show neat scenes, challenges and perseverance. I am surprised that Tyler did not die in all that ice. I guess there would not be a movie, would there? In such circumstances I am sure I would freeze to death. The movie is fun, interesting, educational, the cinematography is great, and also touches on the Indians' religious beliefs, that it is always interesting. I love that movie. Favorite Scenes: Candle light dinner, with barbecued mice. All the mice starring at Tyler while he eats his dinner. The menu: mice with crackers, barbecued mice,  mouse sandwiches . . .  The territorial demarcation with the wolves; the wolf finishing in two minutes what Tyler needed many cups of tea to do. Funny!!!! Favorite Quotes: ""We are suspicious of what we don't understand."" I recommend it!  This is an extremely enjoyable movie. I have seen the movie many times."
545,tt0086005,9,"This movie premiered at an age in my life when I was fascinated with wolves and their impact on nature - at 10 years old, I met a researcher while on a trip with my parents who actually lived with wolves for 9 months out of the year.  On his recommendation I read Farley Mowat's ""Never Cry Wolf"" and finagled my theater-phobic parents into taking me to see the film shortly thereafter.Its impact on me, partially because of my love for the subject matter, has been lifelong.Although the film does not always capture the humor of Mowat's narrative, it does a brilliant job of portraying, with patience that may grate on the nerves of blockbuster-seasoned moviegoers, the experience of its protagonist.  Complaints that the film does not focus enough on the wolves are understandable, but the book and the movie are about one man's journey to understanding the wolf's place in a natural ecosystem.  He must learn to be like them, understand their behavior (which mirrors humans' in so many ways), and ultimately choose a loyalty to one or the other species.It is advisable that the viewer adopt expectations similar to those for a National Geographic documentary, although the story is only loosely based in fact.  Sometimes things happen slowly in the arctic. Sometimes they don't happen at all, or the things that happen are not what you'd want out of the ""plot"".  Cinematography and the environment are stunning.  Charles Martin Smith's Tyler is a regular guy, without spectacular heroics (but brave enough to tackle activities ""Fear Factor"" contestants won't touch for a pile of money).Because it was filmed entirely on location and without pretense of special effects, its visuals stand up very well in comparison to the films of today. Its pace is the sticking point that will make it unpalatable to some viewers, but I give it a rarely-awarded 9 rating for its beauty, social conscience and thorough enjoyability, taking away 1 point only for its somewhat heavy-handed finale that is less palatable than Mowat's original message."
546,tt0086005,7,"The researcher Tyler (Charles Martin Smith) is assigned by his government to travel to the Arctic to study the wolves that they believe are responsible for the reduction of the caribou population. The reckless pilot Rosie (Brian Dennehy) takes him to the wilderness and he is left alone with his supply in an extremely cold spot. He is saved by the local Ootek (Zachary Ittimangnaq) that is traveling with his dog sledding. He builds a shelter for Tyler and organizes his supplies. Tyler finds two wolves that he calls George and Angeline and their three offspring and he examines his excrement to learn what they eat. Soon he discovers that the wolves eat only mice and Tyler decides to do the same to prove to the government that the wolves do not eat caribous. Ootek returns with his friend Mike (Samson Jorah) that speaks English and translates what Ootek say. The trio stays together and Tyler learns that Mike is a hunter. Mike travels with Ootek by canoe to see a herd of caribou that is attacked by a pack of wolves. Tyler examines the bones and finds that the animal was diseased, proving that the wolves are responsible for keeping the caribou strong as told by Ootek. Tyler finds Rosie with two hunters planning to explore the area with tourism and Tyler has an argument with the pilot and returns to the camp. He finds the three offspring but the wolves are missing. Tyler initially suspects of Rosie but when he sees the nervous Mike, he finds that he killed the animals. ""Never Cry Wolf"" is a wonderful film with magnificent cinematography and beautiful story based on the biography of the Canadian Farley Mowat. Presently the film gives the sensation of a National Geographic movie but it was very impressive and unique in 1983 when it was released. Maybe this is the best role of Charles Martin Smith, performing a scientist living in the wilderness alone for a long period and understanding the behavior of wolves. Last but not the least, the ecologic concern of this film is ahead of time. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Os Lobos Nunca Choram"" (""The Wolves Never Cry"")"
547,tt0086005,8,"I saw this film in my Biology class since we were learning about organisms and how they interact with their environment. I'd have to say that this was a good movie and pretty enjoyable. Charles Martin Smith had a good performance and the script made him have good dialogue, along with him narrating almost most of the film too. I liked how the main character inhabited in all the places he encountered to and how he became friends with the Inuit. I thought those scenes were included nicely in the film. Overall, a good adventure that was interesting throughout the movie. I recommend it.Hedeen's Outlook: 8/10 *** B"
548,tt0086005,1,NEVER CRY WOLF is a motion picture that is nothing short of miraculous. Film maker Carroll Ballard succeeded in creating a magnificent motion picture filled with overwhelmingly beautiful and evocative imagery that stirs the soul and fills the heart with wonderment. In addition the film is augmented by a brilliant and haunting musical score.It is rare for a film to touch me as profoundly as this one did. I'd like to see an indelible print of NEVER CRY WOLF be placed within a time capsule so that the generations of the next Millenium could experience it.
549,tt0089908,8,"To truly understand and appreciate ""Return to OZ"", you've got to know two things.First off, this is NOT a follow-up to the classic MGM movie.  This can't be emphasized enough.  It is actually a synthesis of the first five or so sequels to the BOOK.  (This isn't a dig at the movie, mind you.  If you don't like it on some level or other, you can't be human.  It's just that the movie was based on the book in the respect that the characters in the movie had the same names as the characters in the book.)Secondly, L. Frank Baum's original, printed-page OZ is, quite possibly, the most messed up imaginary universe ever created.  There's a land of beings who throw their own heads at you as weapons.  There's a land of sentient vegetables who raise *people* in their gardens (think ""Motel Hell"" and you've got the idea).  To top it all off, it turns out that Dorothy's buddies are really good at killing things; in particular the dear, heartless Tin Man who bloodies up his hatchet with unsettling apathy.What I'm trying to get at here is that ""Return to OZ"" is an OZ movie that is much more faithful to the books.  Much more ""THIS is how long you have to be alive!"" than ""We represent the Lullaby League"".  I think it goes without saying that you'd be legally insane to show it to little kids, but fantasy fans, OZ enthusiasts, and fans of cult movies should hunt it down as soon as possible.By the way, please note that the old-school herky-jerky puppets and claymation monsters in this movie are scary as all get out.  Compare this to the awful remake of ""the Haunting"" with it's stupid cartoonish CGI creatures (and this isn't a dig at computer animation, but since the technique is inheritely realist, it's not scary).  There is a lesson here."
550,tt0088814,8,"I get tired of hearing people say that this is one of the worst Disney films ever. This film is energetic and action packed.Simply because the movie is on the bleak side it has gotten unjust criticism. Sure Disney was not at a high point during this time but this movie was better than many others made during the 80's. Oliver and Company is good and I like it more than this but that's because I have more memories from it than BC. The Great Mouse Detective was alright but not anywhere as remotely good as these two films.I haven't seen The Black Cauldron many times but it is a good Disney film. People who have a problem with the darkness of the film let me put it this way, ""Don't watch it and don't show it to your young children!"" If you think they can handle it later on than go ahead but don't knock the movie just because it's not what you think Disney should be.The Black Cauldron is geared more towards a male audience but I am sure some girls may enjoy it as well.If you haven't seen The Black Cauldron and your a big Disney fan at least give it a shot."
613,tt0120917,9,"You've often heard the sales pitch, ""adults will love it, too!"" almost always referring to a kids' movie and in particularly, an animated movie for children. Well, in this case I agree. Even as a middle-aged adult, I enjoyed this.The dialog is adult-friendly but at the same time not coarse or crude with no sexual innuendos, no profanity or even a hint of it. Yet, it's hip with some very clever lines.The story is interesting and offers a few unique twists. David Spade does a fabulous job narrating, has a very pleasing voice, one that's fun to hear. I actually do think adults would like this more than children."
553,tt0089731,1,"When One Magic Christmas came out in 1985 on TV, my mom recorded it on to a VHS tape. We had this beat up, bad copy of the movie. You had to turn the volume up all the way in order to hear anything, still this movie was amazing to me. Mary Steenbergen doesn't believe in Christmas or Santa. She is such a scrooge about the season, that not even her kids' excitement could change the way she feels. With an angels' help, her daughter Abby, tries to get her into the spirit. It's full of magic, adventure, enchantment, and many lessons learned. One Magic Christmas is funny, dramatic, and wholesome. It's one of those movies that you truly can watch with your whole family, and everyone will like it. My sister and I loved it so much when we were kids that we used to watch it year round. I love this movie very much. They just recently re-released it on DVD, so now I have a good copy of the movie that has meant so much to me growing up. I still say that it's one of my all time favorite movies!!!!"
554,tt0089731,9,"One Magic Christmas is one of my favorite Christmas movies of all time. While I don't remember seeing it in the theater (apparantly I did, but I had just turned 3 years old), I watched our videotaped copy (recorded off of the Disney Channel circa 1986) so many times as a little girl(regardless of the season), the first few minutes of the tape literally wore out, filling with snow and static. This, and the fact that I had every line memorized, has become something of Christmas Lore in my family. Tonight (Christmas 2005), I watched the film again with my parents and sister for the first time in many years, and was stuck by several things: first, how well the film has held up over the last twenty-years; second, how special and unique the message is from ""traditional"" family holiday movies that were made in the 80s and 90s; and third, how I still remember many of the lines of dialog -- they are indelibly etched into my brain after literally hundreds of viewings.""One Magic Christmas"" is sort of an alternate take on ""It's a Wonderful Life"" -- centering around a family who has fallen on hard times with a mother who never says ""Merry Christmas"" and is generally devoid of any holiday sentiment altogether. Her daughter Abbie, together with the Christmas Angel Gideon, embark on a plan to help her re-find the Christmas spirit.Mary Steenburgen is fantastic as the loving, but icy mother. Her performance is very real -- she is both funny and dramatic, and her character is developed in a way that most family films omit. Harry Dean Stanton is perfect as Gideon, the angel - calming and knowing. You believe he is who he says he is. The child actors in the film are equally fantastic. In a family film, the kids can either make it or break it. These children act like real kids -- they aren't trying to be cute for the camera (although they really are adorable -- and this is coming from someone who dislikes most children on TV/movies) and they hold their own with their adult counterparts with ease. The little girl that plays Abbie is effortless in her portrayal of a girl with an non-wavering belief in Santa Clause.Honestly, one of the things I think that I like best about this film is how real it seems. Considering magic and faith are primary elements of the story - this really says something. The acting is so good, the dialog believable, that the more mystical situations do not seem out of bounds. The film also delves into darker, more realistic themes than you get in most family fare. This is really exceptional, especially considering this was a Disney picture. The ultimate message of the film is heartening and poignant - even for those of us who are grown and long-since stopped believing in Santa and magic.This is one of those movies that just feels good to watch. I can honestly say, even if this film didn't have the sentimental value it does for me, I would still recommend it as an excellent Christmas movie."
555,tt0089731,1,"I've been watching this movie every Christmas since it first appeared on CBC in the '80s, and I have to say, I spend most of the movie misty-eyed. In this familiar story of a woman who has lost the Christmas spirit and rediscovers it through being shown how fortunate she is, there are several excellent performancesand a strong feeling of magic throughout.Mary Steenburgen, who plays Ginnie Grainger, the woman who has lost theChristmas spirit, undergoes an amazing transformation and some of the mostheart-wrenching moments I've seen on film. Harry Dean Stanton, as the angelGideon, plays his part with sensitivity, and Gary Basaraba is excellent as Jack, Ginnie's husband. Abbie, the six-year old daughter of the main character, steals the show, however. She never seems to be acting, and carries the innocence of childhood and the magic of Christmas with her. Keep an eye out for a veryyoung Sarah Polley as Molly Monaghan, and veteran Canadian actor JanRubes as the best Santa Claus on film to date, if only for his amazing costume.Keep a box of tissues on hand when you watch this movie! It demonstrates that a movie can be magical without overwhelming special effects, and that aChristmas movie can be sentimental without being schmaltzy."
556,tt0089731,1,"First of all, let me say that this is not the movie for people looking to watch something spirited and joyous for the holidays. This movie is cold, brutal, and just downright depressing. Mary Steenburgen plays a grinchy mom who is down on Christmas because her husband has lost his job, they are losing their house, can't buy Christmas presents for the kids, etc. You get the idea, happy stuff for the holidays. So along comes Harry Dean Stanton as Gideon the Christmas angel, who in his dark hat and long overcoat comes off more like a pedophile who hangs around children all day observing them. What better way to instill the spirit of Christmas in Mary Steenburgen than to kill off her family and then offer to bring them back if she believes in Christmas again. Santa Claus is a blackmailer and his Christmas workshop looks more like a haven for refugee Nazis on the lam. The movie lays everything on so thick that you don't care about the happy ending when it comes because the rest of the movie is so bitter and unbelievable. I'm sure this film wanted to be something Capra-like, but it left out the joy and sentiment on what a holiday film should be."
557,tt0089731,1,"I first saw this movie shortly after it came out. It was back in the mid 80's. I remember watching it and loving it and telling my Mom about it. We've watched it almost every year since. Its kind of a sad story in a way but its so good. I can't explain why i like it so much. It just warms your heart. Harry Dean Stanton does a great job as Gideon, the Christmas Angel and Mary Steenburgen as the Mom who doesn't believe in Christmas is great. The best performance is Jan Rubes as Santa Claus. He is in my opinion the best interpretation of Santa Claus I've ever seen. I recommend that everyone watch this movie, its been 20 years and I'm still enjoying watching it every year. It isn't Christmas for me until I've watched this movie."
558,tt0089731,9,"Exquisitely made holiday fable with a decidedly dark edge, not unlike ""It's a Wonderful Life"" in tone. Mary Steenburgen is very convincing as a woman whose heart has been hardened by life's harsh realities. Christmas has become an empty ritual to her and it takes a highly unusual angel named Gideon (played by a softspoken Harry Dean Stanton in a long cattleman's duster) to make her see the light. Her conversion requires some grim but realistic machinations by Gideon, as well as the simple and unquestioning faith of her optimistic husband and children. But the result is an emotionally powerful finale that is honestly earned, not the easy tearjerking of lesser films. Special mention should be made of the two terrific child actors who play Steenburgen's kids, especially Elizabeth Harnois as the youngest, Abbie, whose unsticky line readings are a treat. Character actor Jan Rubes makes a wonderful, matter-of-fact Santa Claus. The production is further enhanced by Frank Tidy's meticulous cinematography, some imaginative art direction, particularly in Santa's toy shop, and a lovely score by Michael Conway Baker. Thomas Meehan's scenario delves into some dark territory for a genre that is all too often treacly instead of real, but its clear antecedents are treasures such as ""A Christmas Carol"" and the aforementioned Capra classic. A word of caution, however: this is not recommended for very young children. But for 8 and above, and adults, it's a Christmas tale that may well become a perennial in your house, as it is in mine."
559,tt0089731,3,"I thought this was one of the most depressing holiday movies I have ever seen--the others being THE Christmas WIFE and JACK FROST. All three movies are about death. If you LIKE being thoroughly depressed, then by all means watch this film or any of the others. In this film, the acting is good and some of the scenery (apart when people are dying) is lovely. But, I am worried that a clinically depressed person might accidentally see the film and do themselves in! Despite a ""happily ever after"" ending, the major portion of this film is one awful disaster following another. And, for some crazy reason, I DON'T WANT TO BE DEPRESSED when I watch a Christmas movie (I know this sounds crazy folks--after all, isn't bawling your eyes out and feeling miserable what the holidays are all about anyway?).For a more uplifting viewing experience, try the forgotten HOUSE WITHOUT A Christmas TREE, George C. Scott's Christmas CAROL or A Christmas STORY instead--unless of course you like being miserable."

614,tt0120917,1,"Hard to see why it wasn't a wildly popular mega-hit - I have two theories, one charitable, one not.  The charitable theory is that people were put off by the title.  MY heart certainly sank when I heard it.  I mean, just say it out loud - ""The Emperor's New Groove"" - now how could a good movie POSSIBLY have a title like that?Yet now, I rather like the title.  It fits the story; it doesn't care if it's fashionable or not; it's just so pleasingly RIGHT - but in an almost indescribable way you'll have to watch the film to find out.  Maybe it WAS a marketing mistake.  Who cares?  I never took seriously the charge that Disney's artistic decisions were made by its marketing department, anyway.That was the charitable explanation for why it made considerably less, inflation adjusted, than every other one of Disney's animated features from ""Beauty and the Beast"" on, and failed to even get nominated for a ""Best Picture"" Oscar in a year in which they had difficulty coming up with half-plausible candidates.  The uncharitable explanation is probably closer to the truth.  People are idiots.  This is a classic - but it's also animated - by pencil on paper rather than finger on keyboard - so who will ever notice?Doubt me?  You won't once you've seen it.  Everyone to speak of who did reports that it's very, very funny, and they're right - and trust me, nothing is ever THIS funny unless it's clever and witty as well.  It goes without saying that their character animation is unmatched in its brilliance and ... I've already used the words ""humour"" and ""wit""?  Well, I'll use them again.  In addition there's a charming dottiness that a merely hip film could never quite capture.  Art direction is perfectly judged and consistent throughout, with a pleasing absence of because-we-can computer effects.Here's just ONE example of what I'm talking about.  One side of the emperor's palace consists of this HUGE golden face, and we find out in a funny scene (but they're all funny) that all excess water is drained out through the nostrils.  But that's not all we see.  We see characters crawling out of the nostrils, we see someone dangling like a big booger on a rope out of one of the nostrils - one snot gag after another - yet no explicit camerawork ever draws our attention to them.  Not only do the characters deliver their lines perfectly deadpan, the camera delivers its images perfectly deadpan.  It's just perfect.Two more things I should mention.  Unlike Disney's other recent features, it never, not even for a second, feels as though the story has been unduly compressed - and at 78 minutes it's a trifle shorter than most.Also, despite the constant hilarity, it's rather touching.No movie I've seen in the past six months has filled me with such joy. Well, perhaps there have been a few others, but they were all made long ago."
561,tt0089731,1,"Like ""It's a Wonderful Life"", this is a movie that avoids being overly sentimental by exposing real darkness in the protagonist before she gets the opportunity to miraculously gain a new perspective on herself and the people important in her life. Harry Dean Stanton is heartbreakingly genuine as the Gideon, the Cowboy Angel. As an old fan of John Byner as a comedian/impressionist, I was impressed that I didn't even recognize him in a dramatic character role until I saw the credits. The children's responses as tragedy unfolds are remarkable, simple, direct and real. As a fan of Mary Steenburgen, with a bit of a crush on her when I saw the movie, it was difficult to see her be so convincing as an initially unsympathetic character. This is a film with an edge, perhaps not for the faint of heart or skittish children, but it's the kind of movie I look forward to seeing again and love to introduce to friends."
562,tt0089731,1,"This was the WORST Christmas movie I ever saw. I took my two small children to see this. It was the darkest, most dismal plot- family has no money, mom loses her job, father gets killed in the bank, bank robber steals family car with both kids in the back and after high speed chase, drives off the bridge and drowns them in the river. Mom is left all alone. No wonder her Christmas spririt is gone. Christmas angels do not rescue children that have drowned, and Santa does not bring back dead fathers! I thought this was the WORST message to send children. Better to tell them that there is NO Santa than show them a movie like this!!"
563,tt0091149,1,"This is, by far, one of the most underappreciated Disney classics of all, and one of the most developed as far as the character and the story.  Basil is a perfect portrayal of Basil Rathbone as Sherlock Holmes, and many don't know that it was based off a book about a mouse who lived the life of his idol, none other than Sherlock Holmes.Personally, I love this movie because it has a colorful, developed cast of characters.Basil is not your average Disney hero, having no love interest at any point in the movie; he is also a super-intelligent character and often bursts into fits of scientific observation.  His facial expressions are timed well and are very well done, as well as his general movement.  He is very excitable and you can tell he adores working on cases.  He doesn't really like children, as you can see from the way he treats Olivia in the beginning. You really get a feel for Basil when watching him, and he's not easy to forget.  Kids may not understand half of the things he's saying, but it's fun to watch.Olivia is the little heroine mouse who starts Basil on his case, losing her father to a mysterious peg-legged bat of whom Basil is aware of.  She is extremely plain-drawn and has no emphasis on her gender really, save for the bow in her hair and her voice, making her very realistic.  She also acts alot like a realistic little girl, in her laugh, in the way she reacts to things, even in the way she exclaims ""father!"" when reunited with her toymaker father.  Her curiosity is classic, and she has a high adoration for Basil, though he doesn't appreciate her at the start of the story.Dawson is the elder mouse who finds Olivia looking for Basil of Baker Street.  He isn't sure of who Basil is, but they end up finding him together.  Dawson is, of course, Watson in mouse form, and helps Basil in his first case, being this movie.Ratigan is the villain played by the late horror film star Vincent Price, and quite well in my opinion.  He has the likeness of Mr. Price in the way he moves and acts.  Of course, nothing is weirder than hearing him sing, but it happens twice in the movie-- ""The World's Greatest Criminal Mind"" and ""Goodbye, So Soon"" were both written specifically for Price.  He is not one of the more frightening villains as far as his looks, and is unique in that up until the climax he uses his intelligence to battle Basil, instead of the strength he obviously posesses.  On a special note, Ratigan dislikes being called a rat for some reason, though I cannot remember why.Fidget is probably one of the darkest villain henchmen in a Disney movie. He is frightening to children in appearance and voice, and the music accompanying him adds a comical aura.  Fidget is by far my favorite Disney henchman, just because he's funny.  The one thing that bothers me, though, is that a few times in the movie, his peg leg switches from right to left. I think it was just for the reuniting scene in which Olivia steps on his only foot, so it was switched.The movie has many fast-paced scenes, including ""Investigation At The Toy Shop"" and ""Big Ben Chase"", among others.  My personal favorite is ""Big Ben Chase,"" because it is one of the longest Disney climaxes and it is a very unlikely setting.  The movie itself is about Olivia's toymaker father being kidnapped by Fidget, and her turning to Basil for help.  Basil's nemesis, Ratigan, is linked to the bat, and Basil, who was reluctant and annoyed by Olivia's protest at first, jumps at the oppertunity to see if he can finally defeat Ratigan.  The movie goes from there with its ""many twists and turns"", to quote Basil.If you want a fun-filled, unpredictable adventure, The Great Mouse Detective is your best bet.  Especially if you're a Sherlockian or Eve Titus fan who has yet to see this exiciting portrayal of Basil of Baker Street."
564,tt0091149,1,"This is probably one of the most unknown Disney classics.For the time the movie was quite new and revolutionary and it doesn't quite fit in with the other movies Disney made in that period., perhaps that's the reason why it has been forgotten. But ""The Great Mouse Detective"" deserves to be known and seen.The characters are real classics and one of the best to have ever appeared in a Disney movie. Actually Professor Ratigan (voiced by the legendary Vincent Price) is quite possibly my favorite movie villain of all time. No wonder that it was Vincent Price's favorite role. His style and humor is priceless and it cracks me up every time. But the other characters are also very memorable. I especially like the character of doctor Dawson.The story is good and very pleasant and very mature compared to other Disney's from that period. But of course the idea of making a story about the mouse version of Sherlock Holmes alone is already good enough to make a fun movie about.One of the other things that makes this movie different compared to other Disney's from that period are the songs or better said the lack of it. The movie features only one song (3 if you count the bar song and the goodbye, so soon song.). But it's not a miss. The surprising magnificent musical score by famous composer Henry Mancini make up for this loss.The movie has a very spectacular final on and in the famous Big Ben. It's by far my favorite Disney movie ending.Certainly a fun movie to watch over and over again.10/10P.S.: If you're Dutch speaking, I highly recommend that you watch this movie Dutch spoken. Believe it or not it's even better and more fun then the English version! Believe me, just give it a shot.http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
565,tt0091149,1,"The Great Mouse Detective is one of my favorite Disney films of all time, it's also one of the most under rated in my opinion. I think just because I love the story so much and it always brought up good memories, this was the funniest Disney animated movie I had seen at the time. It's just such a cute film, it has fun animation, catchy songs, and such a touching story that anyone could easily fall in love with. My parents and I watched this movie together all the time when I was a child, still to this day, I don't mind sitting down to watch it, it's just that much fun.A young little mouse girl and her toy shop father are celebrating her birthday, but her father is quickly taken away by a rotten gang of mice who are led by a giant rat, Ratigan, who is planning to over throw the queen and become leader of the mouse world. Olivia, the daughter, goes to Basil of Baker Street, he's a mad detective who has been chasing Ratigan for a long time. Along with the help of an average mouse, Dr. Dawson, Olivia, and Basil go after Ratigan to make sure that his plan fails.The Great Mouse Detective is such a cute film. I'm very sure that you'll enjoy it, it's one of my personal favorites, I really do think this is one of the better Disney films and is an under rated treasure. I just loved Basil, his madness was just so funny and enjoyable to watch. I also loved Ratigan's song of why he is so great, not to mention how he thinks he's a mouse is just priceless. This is a fun family film to watch, I highly recommend it.10/10"
566,tt0091149,9,"The Great Mouse Detective is so underrated, it's criminal. How does nobody know about this?! It has one of the best cast of characters in a Disney film, one of the best Disney villains ever (voiced by the amazing Vincent Price, no less), and is packed with fun and adventure.Brilliant and eccentric detective Basil of Baker Street is given the case of a lifetime when young Olivia Flavisham comes to his doorstep for help. Her father, a gifted toymaker, has been abducted by Professor Ratigan, a notorious criminal whom Basil has been chasing for years. With the help of the young mouse and the kindly but down-to-earth Dr. Dawson, Basil sets out to rescue Olivia's father and foil Ratigan's scheme.The story seems a bit plain, but the plot isn't what makes TGMD exciting. It is the characters which bring the movie to life and make it worth watching. Being based off Sherlock Holmes himself, Basil is naturally an intelligent badass. He's enthusiastic about his work and little else at the beginning of the film, and doesn't care much for Dawson and Olivia upon first meeting them, but as the film progresses he starts opening up to them, especially Olivia. It's a nice bit of character development which gives the film heart without becoming sentimental. Dr. Dawson's warmer and less dramatic personality provides the perfect foil for Basil, and Olivia is charming and adorable without being cutesy-cutesy or annoying. But the best character has to be Ratigan, one of the great unsung Disney villains. He's funny as hell, gleefully enjoying every bit of evil he engages in and doing so with larger-than-life style; on the other hand, he can be pretty scary too, and if he snaps, boy are you screwed. He's voiced brilliantly by Vincent Price, who you can tell had a lot of fun doing the part.The animation isn't breathtaking, but it's still good. A lot of the character animation is done extremely well, in particular facial expressions. The backgrounds are lovely and dark, perfectly giving the film the atmosphere of foggy Victorian London.Though it's not much of a musical, the few songs in TGMD are good. I especially like ""Let Me Be Good to You"", which is catchy and, when viewed in context to the film, very suggestive and adult. Hilarious. Good characters, good songs, humor, heart, adventureit's all there. It's no Pinocchio or Beauty and the Beast, but it's still a wonderful movie. How awful it is that it isn't well-known! It's one of those Disney films you'll still enjoy even when you're older, and if you haven't seen it yet, definitely check it out.8/10"
641,tt0280030,7,"""Peter Pan In Return To Never Land"" is Disneys animated sequel to their truly classic 1953 adaptation of J.M. Barries beloved childrens story. Times moved on since the first movie and although Peter Pan never grew up, Wendy did. Its now World War Two and an adult Wendy is living in London, still telling tales of Peter Pan, Captain Hook, Tinkerbell and all the other inhabitants of Never Land to her two children; Danny, an awe struck little boy and Jane, a more cynical, pragmatic older girl who has no time for fairytales. However when Hook flies his sailing ship to London, kidnaps Jane and takes her to Never Land, she soon wishes she has paid more attention to her mothers stories.
With a budget of a mere $20M the film was produced by Disneys TV animation department (who have previously toiled over straight to video/DVD sequels for other Disney movies including ""Cinderella,"" ""The Lady And The Tramp,"" ""The Lion King"" and ""The Little Mermaid""), but this was apparently always planned as a cinematic release. The film succeeds in combining the traditional feel of the original 50s animation with a more contemporary look, particularly for the intrepid young heroine Jane (whose modern looking bobbed haircut was actually highly fashionable during World War Two!). The use of computer generated animation does successfully enhance certain scenes, sometimes so subtly you dont even notice, and sometimes  in the case of Tinkerbells magical pixie dust  to spectacular effect. However Hooks computer generated ship, while certainly impressive, unfortunately stands out uncomfortably from the traditionally animated environments that surround it. Overall though ""Peter Pan In Return To Never Land""  only the second sequel to a Disney feature to be released on the big screen  more than deserves a cinematic outing, and will no doubt go down well with the latest generation of Disney fans, who have grown up with a VHS copy of the original at home."
642,tt0280030,9,"My friend and I went and saw this movie and felt like we were little again. It made us laugh and it was great to see some of our favorite characters come alive again.  I hate to read about critics when they dissect the movie, all you need to know is that it's a wonderful sequel, that personally, I plan to see again.  No matter what age you are you'll leave after with a smile on your face.  Jane is the perfect portrayal of kids these days and what they're missing.  So do yourself a huge favor and just go see it."
567,tt0091149,8,"Having revisited this film on the anniversary of its first release I was shocked at how good it is. I was also left to wonder why Disney never did anything with it since its release since its a very good film.The plot is simple, Basil of Baker Street helps a young girl find her kidnapped father who is the clutches of the evil Ratigan. There's more to it than that but thats a place to start.Vincent Price, probably having the time of his life, is the foul villain and he seems to be having a complete ball. What ever joy he was feeling must have been infectious since the work the animators did carried over and its fun to watch Price's animated alter ego mug for the camera.This is the last of the un-politically correct films from The Mouse House. Characters smoke, which as we all know is now a no no since Disney is now going back and digitally erasing all trace of that ""bad habit"" from all of their earlier films. Characters die. Yes the villain still dies these days, and perhaps a Mom to get the plot going, but here we have  several characters die, one simply for insulting the villain.The final sequence of this film, a battle in and on Big Ben was promoted as Disney's first major use of computer animation. The sequence is spectacular and one of the greatest animated pieces I've ever witnessed even today. The whole thing lasts maybe five minutes but it pushes the art of animation as far as Disney has ever gone and shows us what a loss the politically correct, story formula has been in the realm of artistic animation. Disney learned how to make money but not films that pushed the envelope of what was possible. What might have happened if they had expanded on this one sequence?See this movie. I give it 8 out of 10. Its not perfect but it is funny and exciting in ways that the films that followed rarely were. The film also contains several moments that prove that Pixar are not the only ones who can make movies that reflect the Warner Brothers style."
568,tt0091059,1,"I had seen this movie on VHS back in the 80's and I now have children and just watched this movie with them on DVD. The film still has presence and the special effects are still quite good even considering they are now near 20 years old. Very impressive and my children are now complete fans of the movie. If you have never seen this film, I would recommend it whole-heartedly for the entire family. If it has been sometime since you watched this film I would say check it out, well worth a return visit.One thing I have to mention is the joy I was receiving just watching my children (ages 4 through 8) experience this movie for the first time. Even after all of the Hi-tech movies they have seen in recent years this movie was still able to capture their attention, hold it and entertain just as well as anything in recent memory (such as Spiderman, Hulk or even Spy Kids).My children wanted to re-watch it immediately after it ended, it was that good in their (short attention span) minds.5 out of 5 stars from me and mine. **Although regarding the DVD transfer, it could have used some extra's, even a trailer from the original film, however there were none, simple menu access and set-up options only, enjoyable none-the-less."
569,tt0092638,5,"This is a film appreciated most by those who enjoy nature and animals. There is little speaking in the film as the star of the film is Benji, and he is lost in the wild and away from humans. (There is maybe a minute or two of dialogue at most in the entire film.) This film entirely focuses on Benji and some wild kittens that he takes care of in the wild and tries to keep from danger. It's a cute film, but it also shows us the not-so-cute side of nature when some of the kittens end up in fatal situations. A touching film, Benji the Hunted will be enjoyed by children and it sends a good and honest message to us about nature and survival."
570,tt0092638,8,"It's been years and years since I've seen this one but I remember it very fondly. Perhaps one of neatest things about the movie is that there is little to no dialog so we don't have to worry about horrible actors.
Benji is great. He is extremely convincing when he stops to ponder various situations like when he knows his owner is nearby but he decides against going home right away.I just happened across the page for Benji but now that I have, I think I need to get to Blockbuster to pick this one up. I highly recommend."
571,tt0092638,8,"I remember seeing the first two Benji movies as a kid, but when this came out, I was in high school and didn't have an interest in seeing it during that time in my life. Just now watched this on DVD, twenty years later after it was released in theaters, and I can honestly say that my girlfriend and I truly enjoyed this movie. Some of the peril might be a little upsetting for small children or sensitive viewers, but it simulated drama that was more compelling than the first two Benji movies. The first movie will always be a classic, but this movie seemed to be more effective, probably due to the setting and the plot. Having less cheesy human dialog like the first two movies had was refreshing as well. Just letting the animals ""act"" made for an enjoyable movie watching experience. Anyone who is an animal lover will really love this movie! I highly recommend it!"
572,tt0092638,1,"I'm 20 and this film just came on the day after Boxing Day, it looked like a cute easy-going Incredible Journey sort of thing so me and my Mum settled down to watch it and we were just blown away. I'd never heard of Benji so there weren't any expectations although it made it harder to understand the beginning. But I wish I'd seen something like that when I was a kid, and I don't care how different films are in the future - when I have children I will DEFINITELY sit them down to watch Benji the Hunted! The acting was frankly astonishing for a dog, and I laughed out loud when the little dark kitten went up to the bear and tried to growl. How they got a small male dog to run up and down and even climb cliffs with cougar cubs in his mouth I will never know. In short, a 20 year old and a 49 year old give this movie 4 big thumbs up and even Dad watched it all the way through, although he'd never admit to liking it"
573,tt0092638,1,"a number of times. Just happened to come upon again this past weekend and I was really not in the mood for a tear jerker, but I sat back and watched it again.What a wonderful film. The dedication that went into the training of these animals and the time it must of took.This film tells a wonderful story of a mutt with love in his heart and the courage to take over a situation that would be very hard for the rest of us to do.Some of us can't take care of and protect our own children sometimes, imagine getting four more kids added onto your waist belt and then having to protect them from predators that walk on four legs with giant fangs or slide upon the ground in quiet with poison in their mouths. Never mind the two legged predators you would have to deal with. Then there is Mother Nature and the other elements of the forest to worry about. Then food - oh my goodness. This little dogs heart is the size of the Earth. Thank you Benji. Thank you for teaching me a little something for when I have kids."
574,tt0092638,9,"Benji the Hunted is a movie that will surely bring a warm joy to animal lovers. The biggest strength of the movie is the detailed portrayal of emotions by the animal star-cast. It is nearly impossible to miss the perfection with which director Joe Camp captures even tiny details like the trembling legs of cougar kittens that followed Benji, the innocence of their faces, or even their spontaneous playful nature. The movie is not about Benji performing breath-taking complicated maneuvers to save the day, rather how Benji faces the day-to-day challenges of living in the wild with the added responsibility of four orphaned cougar kittens. The challenges of the wild are plentiful, enough to keep your eyes hooked to the screen. Yet it's not a fast-paced thriller which would have cost the movie its credibility as a realistic one. The human actors in the movie have very limited role, and the director wastes no time in bundling them out of limelight. Benji again emerges as a hero, showing a big ""human"" heart, and the message of peace and non-violence is very effectively communicated in the movie. The background score is average, yet does its job efficiently by not distracting the audience from the movie. It is a family movie suitable for all age groups, and a recommended watch for all animal lovers."
575,tt0092638,1,Truly truly remarkable filming ....would love to know how they got a male dog to cart around wild baby cougar kittens...totally fascinating! To see how they made this film would be awe inspiring! Many direct tv stations are now showing this film...its about time...the music alone is fantastic and right in rhythm with the events in the film. Benji is trained superbly!!...need more films like this....
576,tt0092638,1,"I saw this movie when I was little on vhs after it came out in 1987, I loved the wildlife element and the fact that benji was so loving and caring for those he protected against the wolf, it sucks that this movie benji the hunted isn't in none of the benji dvd movie collections or on blu ray but hopefully one day it will, and I'd love to see deleted scenes to if there are any, I saw this benji movie before any of the others actually, and later in school I saw a different benji movie and I did not like it, this a certain realness to this movie, not a lot of talking in it, there's a certain sadness or odd feeling that this movie gives off, but benji sacrifices a lot and it shows he is a great dog, I still love this film"
577,tt0092638,1,"Our great K-9 Friend and Rescue Helper Benji is on his way to the forest to help bring a mountain lion's cubs back together again. But on the way, Benji faces the lion, birds and a killer wolf on his persuit. This disney movie is great for the family and not to be missed and a great award to Director Joe Camp and Benji himself. Astonising Forest Photography!"
578,tt0092638,9,"Its such a pleasure to watch this movie.. Its nostalgic and carries out a message like helping when i watched this as a child.. Disney movies always make us feel special when we are in childhood and this movie is an example.. A dog alone in the wilderness teaches us something about a world called ""humanity"" which we think the word only refers to humans.. Such a feel good and heart warming experience ... Its a treat to watch this movie again and again.. Action speaks louder than words is the perfect proverb suitable for this movie, there are no dialogues but we can feel the warmth in every frame of the movie... Totally its a perfect movie for the whole family.. :)"
579,tt0097523,8,"This is a fun movie for the entire family. Well, of course, it's ridiculous but the kids will love it and you can laugh right along with them.The absurd tale revolves around around a nutty scientist & dad named Wayne Szalinski who is working on a machine to miniaturize objects. When his two kids plus their two neighbouring friends (the Thompsons) wander into his lab, Wayne inadvertently shrinks the four of them. Then he accidentally tosses them out in the garbage, so the poor kids have to brave the dangers of the lawn to get back to the house. And can the well intended but crazy scientist figure out how to bring the youngsters back to full size again? (Personally, my favourite aspect of the movie is the nutty father.)The story has plenty of adventure and danger as the teensy weensy younguns brave the perils of the jungle (actually their lawn). They face thunderstorm like risks of potentially drowning in the lawn sprinkler or being attacked by giant ants, bees, & other bugs. Not to mention the lawn mower!Avoid the TV series of the same name, but this movie has some good family messages involving the two sets of parents (the Szalinskis & the Thompsons) as well as the kids. And of course there's lots of hilarity and adventure. It should be rated higher than it is and fully deserved its popularity at the time. This film put the phrase 'Honey, I shrunk (or whatever) the kids' into people's everyday vocabulary!"
580,tt0097523,7,"My Take: A fine family entertainment with some neat special effects. I grew up watching and enjoying this funny, fast-paced fantasy adventure. But when I watched it back then, I always seemed to start it on the part with the scorpion and the ant, so I only watch a few parts. But I finally found it on DVD and watched it from the beginning. And I really enjoyed it. It's really a fantastic fantasy, with elaborate special-effects and lavish ""enlarged"" sets.The film is quite like the fantasy films filmmaker Steven Spielberg produced, like ""Back to the Future"" and ""Innerspace"" for instance. It depicts the adventures of average people, thrust into an adventure of a lifetime, and then must find away to get back safely. That's kinda like the premise of ""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"", a group of neighborhood kids get shrunk to size by a weird machine crazy inventor Rick Moranis invented. Disney triumphs in creating an enjoyable fantasy that's sure to be a charm. The stop-motion effects are still impressive, even if special effects in the 80's have certainly moved on. It's one of the best live-action Disney efforts and a fine fun for the entire family.This film is followed by a sequel ""Honey, I Blew up the Kid"", which is not quite as zany and imaginative as its predecessor. Rating: ***1/2 out of 5."
596,tt0120910,9,"I can't stop watching it!!! Four of the seven new segments in this film are alone well worth the admission.  Roy Disney Jr. sets the stage for a remarkable departure from the usual animated dreck that Disney has been bogged down by for the last half-decade (Toy Story aside).  Disney have hereby restored my faith in them as leading the pack in animated cinema.  I want more!!""Pines of Rome"", a marvelous piece set to the ""story"" of whales leaving the water and eventually the planet, is worth viewing several times for it's symbolism and exquisite look. ""Rhapsody in Blue"", by Gershwin, is given perfect treatment by a day in the life of New York City.  The pace is quick and manages to give each character studied enough depth to make a very satisfying and touching ending. ""Pomp and Circumstance"", the graduation standard, is humorous and sweet. Creating a love story involving Donald and Daisy Duck into the story of Noah's Ark worked surprisingly well. ""Firebird Suite""-  WOW.  This is the most incredible segment of the film. It's a PERFECT marriage of music and animation and MUST be played loud. Very emotional and powerful indeed.I had to post another comment because I can't stress enough that it's a worthy successor to the original Fantasia, and Walt would be proud."
581,tt0097523,7,"Basically this one great and fun adventure movie, for kids especially. It's a Disney movie, so it's most definitely kid orientated, which means that it doesn't have the most complicated script, drawn out characters, or other mind boggling elements but it more than serves its purpose.What is the most appealing aspect of ""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"" are its adventures elements. It was a great move to let the movie for most part be set in the backyard of an ordinary house, of a not so ordinary family. The shrunken kids have to overcome all sorts of dangers in the backyard, such as 'giant' insects, water drops, muddy rivers, lawnmowers and of course avoid being squashed by humans. A new adventure and obstacle awaits at every corner, which makes sure that there is always something happening in the movie and makes things flow well.The movie is perhaps more adventurous and fun than really funny. The most comical aspects of the movie mostly come from the adult cast, from actors such as Rick Moranis and Marcia Strassman as the parents and Matt Frewer and Kristine Sutherland as the neighbors. They mostly make sure that the movie is a perfectly enough watchable and entertaining one for adults. Rick Moranis of course suits the role very well as a nutty scientist. He is perhaps also known best for his roles in the ""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids""-movies than any other one.The movie is well made and Joe Johnston shows himself again a capable director. I have always liked him as a director. He never made any really great movies but his movies are always entertaining, which always make a Joe Johnston movie a pleasant one to watch. This movie was his directorial debut and he could had done a lot worse.The movie has some good effects, also especially considering the time it got made. The movie uses all kinds of effects. Mostly of course consisting out of over-sized sets and objects but also stop-motion effects, mechanical effects and some early special effects. Especially the over-sized objects aren't really convincing looking and are obviously made out of light and non-nature materials but I don't know, this seemed sort of right and a suiting style for a kids movie such as this one. The musical score by James Horner is also a perfectly fine one.About as good and entertaining as a kid's movie can get, though there is also plenty left to enjoy for adults.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
582,tt0097523,7,"Absent-minded genius Moranis accidentally shrinks his kids to microscopic size and they end up in the yard. At their size, they must fight dangerous creatures like ants and bees and menacing household items like a lawnmower and a garden hose before they can traverse back to the house and hope to be restored to normal size. Amusing Disney comedy is fun for the whole family. The special effects are pretty good as simple household objects are shown as humongous from the perspective of the kids. Moranis is likable as the mad inventor and Strassman is cute as his wife. The young actors don't try to be too cute and Frewer is funny as the neighbor whose son has also been shrunk."
583,tt0097523,8,"Being a somewhat big fan of Rick Moranis, I had high expectations when I first saw this movie. I must say, I was not disappointed. The acting was terrific.***Spoilers*** Wayne Szalinski (Moranis) is a nutty scientist who invents strange things. One invention, a shrinking machine, just makes things blow up. At first. Then, a next door neighbor, Ron Thomson, (Jared Rushton) hits a baseball in Wayne Szalinski's lab- in the attic.Soon, four kids are the size of a grain of sand. Only a quarter inch tall, they make their way home. They have many adventures in the backyard, which is a jungle to them. The adventures include encounters with swarming bees, an ant, a lawn mower, and much more.After a near misadventure with a bowl of cereal, the kids are found. Wayne fixes his machine, and the kids are enlarged back to normal size.Later, both the Thomson's and Szalinski's are in the kitchen. On the table is a turkey the size of a piano.This is a well-made movie. It may be a little scary for some younger kids, but it is well worth watching more than once.My Score: 8/10"
584,tt0097523,7,"""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"" is a quite unusual adventure/comedy film, one of the most eccentric movies of all time. It's one of those live-actions films produced by Disney's studios.The movie's title refers to Wayne Szalinski, a stereotypical nutty/mad scientist. He invents a machine with the ability of shrinking objects to a size even smaller than ants. This character is portrayed by Rick Moranis, the perfect actor for a role like this (with his intellectual looks).Rick Moranis is funny as Wayne Szalinski, Matt Frewer is hilarious as the impatient and temperamental ""Big"" Russell Thompson. The kids also do a good job: Thomas Wilson Brown as the clever ""Little"" Russell Thompson, Jared Rushton as the paranoid Ron Thompson and Robert Oliveri as the nerd Nick Szalinski. One of the funniest parts for me is when ""little"" Russell forces his brother Ron to confess that he broke Szalinski's window with his baseball.The Szalinski kids (Nick and Amy) and the Thompson kids (""Little"" Russell and Ron, the Szalinski's neighbors) are accidentally shrunk by the machine and thrown into the garbage by accident. Because they are so tiny, they live a big adventure full of dangers and nightmares (from insects to a remote-controlled lawn mower) until reaching their house, something which would only take seconds on their normal size.The story becomes a bit odd and of a somehow discussable taste, but it also makes the difference... for good and for bad. However, I must be fair: at least this is a thousand times better than those stupid ""Problem Child"" movies. Not that they have anything in common, but... Overall, nothing extraordinary, but amusing, hilarious, great fun, entertaining, original, bizarre and with some funny lines («French class» is just one among many others). There's also a certain 80's charm on it.The success of this movie inspired a very imaginative 3D film created as an amusement for Disneyland parks around the world called ""Honey, I Shrunk the Audience""."
585,tt0097523,7,"Timeless classic. Great adventure movie than never gets old. Yes the effects and props aren't what they used to be, but its still enjoyable today. There's some 80s adventure movies that seem really silly when you watch them today, movies like explorers are just ridiculous when you watch them now, but this has stood the test of time and my son will definitely be watching this with me when hes a bit older."
586,tt0338852,9,"I've read some of the comments on the cheetah girls movie, and I'm surprised at how hard the ADULTS have been on this movie. I'm 16 now, but this movie came out when I was 9 or 10. And all this talk about how unrealistic it was, is STUPID. Of course it's gonna be silly and unrealistic, but this is a CHILD'S MOVIE. Disney caters to ages 6-14, although at that time not many teens watched it so it was probably around 6-11 at the time. I LOVED the movie, and so did all of my friends. We didn't see these girls as rich (nor did we care) as some people have claimed, we didn't sit there contemplating the roles of the characters, and we didn't even think that no one would care about Toto being stuck in a hole at the end, because to us at that age, that was a plausible reason for the police and firefighters to come. Unrealistic? Maybe. But we were KIDS. We cared about Toto and the girls' friendship. Fame wasn't the moral to us, friendship was, at least, that's what I got out of it. So before you rate this like it's an adult/teen lifetime/feature film, think about it from the standpoint of who it was made for, the kids."
587,tt0338852,8,"This is another made-for-TV film and as such is a film that is not high on intellectual output but, if you just sit down and as with Charlies Angels 1 and 2 (the ones with Cameron Diaz, Bill Murray etc.) leave your brain at the door and just enjoy the film for what it is (which is a film about four mid to late teens trying to make it big as self-choreographed (by one of the group members) singers in the music industry) then you should have no problem liking or even loving the film.The film centres on four teenagers (the characters' ages not the actresses) but around them is the usual thoroughfare that is seen in these types of films. There was the unscrupulous record boss that wanted to change them and their style. There was the mother/manager that against her better judgement allowed her daughter and the group to almost get done by him and there was the silly ending that brought the girls back together after one was even less willing to follow the boss's ideas even more than the other three and walked away from the group. The other three eventually decided she was right and also left but by then the group was no more until the silly ending that is. Knowing and accepting that it was following the usual plot lines for this type of film meant it could be enjoyed and yes the second one was better but this one was by no means as bad as others have made it out to be. 8 out of 10 for me."
604,tt0220099,9,"The people who have been posting that this movie is too depressing are missing the point. You can't make a full-length movie about anything, even the mighty Tigger, and just have two hours of ""life is wonderful"" hoo-has without making it terminally boring. So, this movie decides to expand on one of the staple features of the great Tigger... He is the only Tigger alive, as far as he can tell. He wants to meet his long lost family. Since nobody in the Hundred Acre Wood knows where he came from, they all decide to dress up in Tigger costumes. Tigger figures it out, is hurt and upset, and vows to leave the Hundred Acre Wood, forever I might add, during a blinding nor'easter. When he's almost died of hypothermia, he gets rescued by the Hundre Acre folks and realizes that they are all the family He needs. First of all, this movie is no more depressing than ""Bambi,"" ""Lady and the Tramp"" or any ""Charlie Brown"" movie, all of which are geared toward kids. If you cried when Tigger got upset and left in a snowstorm, then this movie did its job. Second, the movie is well done and keeps you enthralled throughout. I actually saw this with an ex-girlfriend and she said it was one of the best movies anyone had taken her to see. This gets a 9 out of 10."
588,tt0338852,8,"Alright, now that everyone has bashed the movie, and mentioned some of the negative points, I'm going to write a review based on all the positive aspects of this movie. So, pretty much all the users have already summed up what this movie is mainly focused on - 4 teenage girls, living an ordinary life, who want to achieve their goal of becoming a well-known pop group. Then mixed with some dramatic scenes, romantic scenes, and also some family love shown.Firstly, I believe the introduction to this movie is a very good way to start the film off with - 4 best-friends chilling outside, dancing, and having a good time in general. What's so bad about that?The characters grow on me as well. They're portraying how teenagers are, and I must say the portrayals are spot on - well, majority of the times. Galleria - strict on what she wants to accomplish, is straight-forward, and doesn't think before what she says...it's not until the very end where she realizes all her mistakes, and that she truly needs her friends back. Chanel - is Galleria's ""home-girl"" in the movie. She's a pretty rich gal, but can get lonely at times as her mom is rarely at home. Dorinda - a girl who lives for dancing, which is the only thing that really keeps her going when times get rough, besides her friends. We slowly find out, that she lives in a foster home, to which her friends don't find out until later into the movie. Aqua - this girl's main passion is for fashion! She's the diva type of the group, the ""glamorized"" one, who can get pretty nasty as well when drama comes into action. I feel like the film also displayed the relationships between the teens, and their families, to a great extent. I mean, you don't really get those moments anymore in Disney films.Overall, this movie, in a way, can be viewed negatively, and/or positively. It's all based on personal preference. I like to give all movies a chance, and see good in them, especially Disney movies. However, now-a-days, the films in Disney are becoming more unrealistic, and the moral of the story-lines...they're just out of tune. Back in the day, the Cheetah Girls were all kids/teens mostly talked about, it was the ""it"" movie that everyone had to watch. Moral of the overall film in my opinion is: In order to reach your goal, you must put all your effort into it, even though you know you'll fall down at times. However, the ability to stitch all the rough patches together, and learn from all your mistakes; you'll have the strength to rise back up to the top, and aim for your one ultimate goal."
589,tt0338852,1,"Having a curiosity in the entertainment that kids and teens are being given today, I happened to watch this film on TV a few days ago.I could be biased and say that movies aren't what they use to be for kids, but this movie went beyond that. This film is a depressing example of how horribly some of today's youth is growing up. I would NOT recommend this film in anyway (unless for laughs at its stupidity).The film starts off with our four 'rich girl' characters strutting down the street with arrogance beyond words. The arrogance, perhaps a normal thing for some teenagers. However, these girls do appear to be filthy rich of which very few kids could relate to leaving them to wonder why can't they be rich little kids too? The goal of these girls of course - To become famous pop-singers. An unrealistic dream for most but it seems to be a moral to the film: ""to have a good life, you need to become famous"".The plot moral, not a great one. The characters little lessons, appalling.'Raven' is so caught up in the 'becoming a pop-star' experience that she becomes completely self-absorbed. This is probably one of the few morals that are presented well. Don't become a self-absorbed idiot.Moving on. Our second character fails entirely at bringing in any good ideals. After some time working on 'the cheetah girls' upcoming career she comes home to throw a tantrum about her mother not being there (rather, she's out with a boyfriend). The real-estate agent rings about her mother's interest in selling the house, the daughter picks up the phone, rudely yelling to the agent how this house is not for sale 'Because I say so' in pure teen angst. Now she decides to go out and abuse her mother's credit card for all the money it's worth because of this small episode.Of course when mum comes home, she is not happy. But apparently it's all OK when the daughter cries out about how her mother should be there more for her. Perhaps if this were a REAL case of child-neglect, this may be OK. But this kid was just a selfish brat who needs to find better ways to get over minor issues.I really hope kids won't think its OK to throw hissy fit next time they discover their parents had to go out.The next character is perhaps the most insulting to the 'real world'. Raven makes an occasional comment to this character about how trashy their fashion looks (and yes, their fashion looks perfectly fine actually).Later in the film we realise that our 'trashy' girl is actually an orphan living in a poor foster home. It's a good idea; however, this girl looks NOTHING like a real 'poor' girl. Perhaps a 'money isn't everything' moral would have fitted nicely here, but instead we're handed the perfect fix: Get your rich friends to buy your clothes.The forth character I won't comment on as I can't remember anything significant about her.The process of becoming pop-stars of course, is very unrealistic, aside the sell-out factor and the lip-syncing.'The cheetah girls' are torn between following their original dream or selling-out just to get the exposure. Their friendship hangs on the line because of this as Raven refuses to compromise.We are given a few inspiring quotes from other characters about which road Raven should take on this matter, then its all up to the wonderful climax to do the rest.The climax. Toto has fallen in a hole and has got dirty (horrifying experience for a dog bearing a perly white coat) Poor Raven is so frantic, this is obviously the worst kind of tragedy that could happen in life. God forbid we learn anything realistic like the death of a family member or even of this poor little pooch. Perhaps in that case we'd even had the President of the United States turning up to comfort Raven, but no, it's just a dirty dog stuck in a hole, it only calls for the whole neighbourhood, police, fire fights and the local television news crew. Such a tragedy can only resolve in the reconciled friendship of 'the cheetah girls'.And there we have it. Entertainment... maybe. Any benefits otherwise, I would personally hope NOT, as they're not the kind of things I would like to see in kids and teenagers these days.Normally, If this film was aimed at a higher audience (ha) I wouldn't see as much of a problem with it. But this was a Disney film... you know, the ones that are meant to be inspiring to kids, or at least teach them some values in life? This just gave us an insight to Disney's own greedy mind."
590,tt0338852,8,"OK first off, all the rude comments was unnecessary. Second,if you guys can figure out that it's Disney Channel then there's a problem, and third the movie was made for kids, if you were expecting something better (like a movie for teens or adults) then go to the movies and see something for a more mature audience!!! I thought the movie was pretty good, of course i don't expect that much from Disney Channel, but in my own opinion it wasn't all that bad. Sure some of the scenes were kind of dumb and didn't make that much sense, but like I said before it was intended for kids to watch, kids don't catch on like more mature audiences do. I personally think that the second one was much better and made a lot of sense. Besides that I thought that the storyline was good, well at least the part where the show how the girls have a real passion for something. If you love something so much and have a passion for it and dream of going big then you should do whatever it takes to get there, and thats what the movie is mostly about. Which is great because it shows the viewer that if you really love something you can achieve it.The acting was OK, it could have been better. I thought that the singing was great (except for one of them, i don't like her voice and i still didn't in the second one). Since I love dancing I thought that the dancing was great too. Sabrina is very talented and shows even more of her talent in the second film. To me she was the most talented one.All in all it thought was movie was pretty good, could have been better but its Disney Channel and meant for kids so if you don't like it then why bother watching it?? Think about that one..."
591,tt0120910,9,"Although I was aware of the original plan to renew the Fantasia concept every so often, and that it was visualised as an ongoing project, I felt that going back after 60 years was too much, and that the original classic should be left alone. However, my initial scepticism was dispelled within seconds of the opening sequence. What we have here is a lush, vibrant fusion of animation and music, each fully complimenting the other to perfection. It's hard to pick a favorite sequence, but if really pressed, for personal taste alone, it would be the awesome sequence with the whales. Mickey's Sorcerer's Apprentice sequence is the only carry over from the original, and a worthy match for it in the 2000 lineup is the Donald ""Noah"".The only criticism I have of the film is the bridging sequences, featuring Steve Martin, Penn & Teller, Bette Midler and others. I would have preferred that they stuck to one presenter, preferably James Earl Jones or Angela Landsbury. They seemed to take the material and the project far more seriously than Martin and Penn & Teller who's humor detracted from the dignity of the movie as a whole."
592,tt0120910,8,"""Fantasia 2000"" is a beautiful sequel of the classic animation ""Fantasia"" (1940). The conductor is James Levine and each segment is introduced by the actor Steve Martin, the violinist Itzhak Perlman, the actress Bette Midler, the entertainer Penn & Teller, the actor James Earl Jones, the conductor Quincy Jones and the actress Angela Lansbury. The audio is in DTS and THX and the program is the following: (1) Symphony No. 5 in C minor-I. Allegro con brio, by Ludwig van Beethoven.(2) Pines of Rome, by Ottorino Respighi.(3) Rhapsody in Blue, by George Gershwin.(4) Piano Concerto No. 2 in F Major-I. Allegro, by Dmitri Shostakovich.(5) The Carnival of the Animals, Finale, by Camille Saint-Saëns.(6) The Sorcerer's Apprentice, by Paul Dukas.(7) Pomp and Circumstance – Marches 1, 2, 3 and 4, by Edward Elgar.(8) Firebird Suite – 1919 Version, by Igor Stravinsky.My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Fantasia 2000"""
593,tt0120910,7,"Top quality animation and a sense of humour make this sequel/add-on a formidable animated movie in its own right. The running time of 74 minutes is a bit of a let-down. I would have liked to have seen more pieces and more imagination. And be warned, The Sorcerer's Apprentice remains. As this was the original's ONLY real selling point they decided to stick it back in there, so you're really only get just over an hours worth of new footage. Which feels like a bit of a rip-off.But my favorite segment is the one with Donald Duck, in fact they were all cool, especially the one with the volcano. The music matches the story perfectly and it has some truly beautiful animation. Far superior to those ugly CGI crap we get these days. And the TV show style introductions were more watchable than the dubbed Deems Taylor segments in the original.This was the first animated movie to be made for IMAX screens and the digital picture is amazing. See this preferably on an IMAX screen or on DVD. Watching it on VHS would only insult the brilliant animation. It's sad that Disney has abandoned traditional hand-drawn animation for theatrical projects. It's what the studio was built on after all. But Disney is shadow of its former self, we all know that.Just as good as the original Fantasia, but loses points for not being longer and more ambitious."
594,tt0120910,9,"Fantasia 2000 has really been screwed over since it was released in January of the year 2000. I was lucky enough to see it on the IMAX screen. I liked it quite a bit then, but never thought about it much. but for some reason, when it was announced that it would be released on DVD, my interest sparked again, and I got it. now, watching it for the second time, i realize just how amazing it was. it is by far one of the most interesting disney projects ever, probably the best and most unique since the original Fantasia. i will go over and rate and criticize each segment now:1. ""Symphony #5"" - the battle between good and evil with colorful abstract triangles, unmistakably based on butterflies, being attacked by black triangles in an ethereal setting. this segment did not impress me at all when i originally saw the film, but seeing it again, i am able to appreciate the pastel artistry (the DVD provides a lot of insight on to how difficult it was to create this segment). the segment as a whole may be one of the weakest, but it is very beautiful. possibly the greatness and familiarity of the music diminishes the segment's overall power. it is possibly the single most famous piece of music ever written. 8/102. ""Pines of Rome"" - a family of whales fly around in the air. i actually disliked this segment when i first saw the film last january. personally, computer animation used in an animated film always made me cringe. watching it again, i now love the way the cgi whales move and look against the cell animated backgrounds. now i feel that this is maybe the best segment of the film. the music is the best of all. i had never heard it before. the story is also probably the best of them all. it turns out to be one of the most beautiful and miraculous pieces of animation ever created. 10/103. ""Rhapsody in Blue"" - several stories of unhappy people are told and intersect in New York City. First off, this is a great piece of music and one of the most unique pieces of animation i have seen. Disney here forgot its attempts at realism and just went for charicatures. it is incredible to see animators create a microcosm of a Robert Altman film as a silent film. This was one of my favorites the first time i saw the film, and it remains so now. 10/104. ""Piano Concerto #2, Allegro, Opus 102"" (The Steadfast Tin Soldier) - again, when i first saw the film, I was annoyed at their use of computer animation. now, i see how wonderful this segment really is and how the computer animation works within the beautiful cell animation. the characters in this segment are beautifully made. the tin soldier himself isn't all that impressive, but the ballerina and the jack-in-the-box are amazing creations, among the most effective characters disney has ever created. I love the music in this one, too. i had never heard it before. the only thing i can fault this film for is that the animators changed the ending from a sad or bittersweet ending to a happy one. they claim that the music made them change it, because the music was more upbeat when it ended. this is true, but i also think that they would never have been allowed to end it sadly even if the music had ended so. Disney does not want to depress anyone, and they would slap a happy ending on it no matter what. but, with the music as an excuse, i can accept the ending of the film. 10/105. ""Carnival of the Animals, Finale"" - my least favorite segment, when i first saw it and now. it is only about 3 minutes long, and i'm glad for that. i do like it a bit more now, the art, watercolor, anyway. the story is very formulaic, and it follows the annoying tradition of silly disney animal characters like Timon and Pumbaa and Sebastion the crab and so many others. The segment is merely okay, and its shortness provides those children who are bored (the movie wasn't made for them in the first place) to be entertained a little more. 7/106. ""The Sorcerer's Apprentice"" - Who can argue? it is a classic. maybe it shows a little laziness in the filmmakers, to just slap this onto a 65 minute film to pad it to 70 minutes, but who cares. it is wonderful. If you get the DVD, make sure to listen to Mickey Mouse's commetary about this segment. it is awesome. 10/107. ""Pomp and Circumstance"" - this may be the most famous of the pieces of music, only competing with Symphony #5, because of its association with graduation. It works surprisingly well with the story of Donald as Noah's assistant who can never find his wife Daisy on the arc and thinks she was left out. Even though they don't acknowledge it anywhere on the DVD, this is obviously based on Buster Keaton's The Naviagator, a silent comedy. This segment ends up being very funny, almost as good as The Sorcerer's Apprentice, and even touching. It is very worthy, even though i know most people blew it off. 10/108. ""Firebird Suite - 1919"" - probably the best of the bunch, and the best film to end on. the order of the segments is actually quite well planned out, spacing them out interspersing beauty and whimsy quite well so as to never cross over emotions between two segments. each starts afresh. The Firebird Suite is the story of death and rebirth in nature, with a sprite helping nature to bloom after the winter. she awakes the firebird, a volcano, which destroys all that she has created. at the end, after being destroyed, a majestic elk revives the sprite and she revives nature. the only fault i could think of, and it does harm the film for a few people, is the tremendous similarities between it and Mononoke Hime, Princess Mononoke, which disney distributed last year. I have heard this segment called a rip-off of that film, but, with the tremendously long amount of time it takes to produce an animated piece, i will guarantee that The Firebird Suite was in developement over a year before Mononoke was released. Death and rebirth is such a common theme, it is universal. It is done as well here as it is in Mononoke Hime. 10/10The interstitials - this is surely the worst part of the film, and it completely diminishes the film's value. We do not need famous people telling us that it is okay to listen to classical music. This is an insult to our intelligence. buy the DVD, and fast-forward over these chapters. 5/10.Overall, 9/10, one of the best films of 2000, one of the most miraculous animated films ever made. It was not well received by critics or audiences, and i think this was a huge mistake. remember, the first fantasia bombed, too. maybe someday in the future, when the minds of Americans become more intelligent and complex again, Fantasia 2000 will get its due."
595,tt0120910,1,Fantasia 2000 is a treat!  The animation and music are splendid--whales in the first segment--cartoons set to Rhapsody in Blue by Gershwin in the second(the best)--a Noah's Arc montage with Donald and Daisy Duck --and my second favorite--Stravinsky's Rite of Spring with a wood nymph battling the death force of a volcano.Definitely 4 stars out of Four..... Highly recommended!
597,tt0120910,8,"The first problem was that there was too much introduction between the pieces. Angela Lansbury and James Earl Jones were the best, but the one with Steve Martin was unnecessary, as well as Penn and Teller. The film itself was a little short, but I enjoyed it anyway. It is beautifully animated, with good choices of music, but if anything, I wish there was more of it. I love the original, but I thoroughly recommend this as well. The animation was spot on, especially in the Pines of Rome segment. This was my personal favourite, as i thought that baby whale was so sweet. Donald Duck's version of Noah's Ark set to the music of Elgar was hilarious, as was the Carnival of the animals. The most beautifully animated was the Firebird sequence,reminding me of FernGully, telling the story of ""Life, death and renewal."" I am not a huge fan of Stravinsky, but the Firebird I have always considered his best work. There was also the abstract images in the Beethoven. They were ambiguous but very well done, but I didn't like the chopping of the piece itself. The section they missed out is essential to the movement's development in my opinion. The Pines of Rome sequence was outstanding I thought, I showed it to my year 4 peers 8 years ago, and they all clapped at the end of that segment but were unenthuasiastic about the rest of the film. Then Gershwin treated us with Rhapsody in Blue, telling the story of a typical day in New York. The Shostakovich was very good, but marred by the interesting but overlong introduction. Great animation and music though. The Saint Saens was funny, but the Magic Trick was pointless. Unfortunately Sorceror's Apprentice was one of the highlights in the original, but was for me the weakest segment here. The Elgar was absolutely hilarious, and the Firebird very heartfelt also I had early memories of thinking the Sprite was absolutely gorgeous. The music was very well performed by James Levine and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. All in all, 8/10 Bethany Cox."
598,tt0120910,8,"We had two kids at home and I went to rent to one thinking it was a typical Disney movie. I was wrong, but the kids still liked it.
I was surprise by the musical choice in this one. Great classical pieces. And the animation is very well done. Some segments better than others.I got to see this one on a regular tv-set, but I guess you should try to see it on an IMAX screen, or at least a cinema screen.Out of 100, I gave it 81. That's good for *** out of ****.Seen at home, in Toronto, on June 15th, 2002."
599,tt0120910,5,"Released 60 years after the original Fantasia, I found that this ambitious and well-produced sequel from Disney Studios fell quite short of my preconceived expectations.When I speak of Fantasia 2000 not living up to my satisfaction, it all comes down to comparing it, as I have, to the 1940 original.What I found was that the original's animated segments were undoubtedly more entertaining and their stories much more well thought out, than were those of the animated segments in Fantasia 2000.When it came to being more vibrantly colourful, and having a greater richness in style, it was the distinctiveness of the hand-drawn animation of the 1940 film that easily won out over the CGI animation effects of Fantasia 2000. As a true work of art, the former's animation techniques were (and always will be) unsurpassed.I view the original Fantasia as a literal masterpiece of classic animation. While, on the other hand, Fantasia 2000 may indeed have had its share of spectacular moments, but, it could never be considered anything even coming close to being in the league of a masterpiece.For the most part Fantasia 2000 did succeed well-enough as being fairly entertaining animation.Out of the 7 new animated segments in this picture there was really only one that impressed me at all. It was the segment presented along with Stravinsky's ""Firebird Suite"" as its musical accompaniment."
600,tt0120910,1,"Probably the best animation film I have ever seen. There are no dialogues and it is not really a feature film. It is an assimilation of 8 short stories. The stories are all beautiful, my favorite ones being the one on New York City, ""Rhapsody in Blue"", and the one on life, death and renewal, ""Firebird Suite"". The film is about everything beautiful in life; amazingly entertaining. Each score is given a brilliant visual concept. And the animation speaks so much more than 'real life' films or any dialogues could for that matter. Animation, though usually aimed at kids is probably much more necessary for us adults as we lose that sense of imagination, beauty and observation. Kids are so wonderfully innocent, imaginative and creative; everything that does matter to them has an animated feel to it anyway."
601,tt0220099,8,This movie is truly enjoyable. I can watch it may times. My wife and I are great fans of Winnie the Pooh and particularly Tigger. He can bounces and can talk really fast. The way that Tigger was looking for his family made it really fun!I recommend that movie to everybody that have babies and/or toddlers.
602,tt0220099,9,"Starting with a lament from Tigger that all the Winnie the Pooh movies are about - well - Winnie the Pooh, this movie goes on to meet his complaint and crafts a story about Tigger, who suddenly decides that being the only one isn't the most wonderful thing about Tiggers. Frustrated because he can't get any of his friends to go bouncing with him, Tigger becomes convinced that there must be a whole family of tiggers somewhere out there in the Hundred Acre woods, and he sets out to find them, leading to a series of adventures for all the gang and disappointment for Tigger, until he suddenly realizes that he didn't need to go looking for his family - they were right there all the time. Having adopted my daughter from China a few years ago (at 5, she loves this movie, by the way) I thought the message was so important: Pooh and Eeyore and Roo and Kanga and Owl and Piglet and Rabbit were Tigger's family - because family doesn't have to look like you or even be the same as you. Family are the ones who care about you and love you, no matter what. The movie includes some nice songs and a few laughs (although it isn't really ""funny"" and also includes a few sad scenes as well.) It's fun for kids and pleasant viewing for adults, too. 9/10"
603,tt0220099,6,"But it should have been a bit longer. 77 minutes is not enough. I have always loved Disney's animation of the Winnie the Pooh TV show and I was way excited when I first learned of this movie. 100 acre wood looks as magical as it always has done and is presented very well in this feature.
The story itself is a bit childish but still manages to have balls when it has Tigger FAIL to find his family. Although I would have liked him too I respect the ending they went for.Although this film isn't to everyone's tastes (I know it seems a little fruity a guy of 20 can like this film) I say you should see this movie, preferably with kids. It's perfect child fodder and good entertainment. Not just family entertainment. Should be longer though."
611,tt0211181,6,"I decided that this was going to be the first movie that I took my young daughter to see. Seeing as how she is a dog lover and is riveted to the TV screen every time she sees a commercial or TV show with a puppy, I figured how could I go wrong?I was sadly disappointed.  I found that the movie tried too hard to be dark and sinister....Cruella got way too much screen time and the puppies, too little.  The movie just wasn't much fun.  Amazingly, my daughter got an hour or so of entertainment from this film, and then got horribly bored.  We ended up leaving before the movie was finished, so I'm not even sure how it ended.The movie was cute, but it ran way too long for the younger set who have a reduced attention span.  More time should have been devoted to the puppies and their antics, and less to Cruella and her scheming.  I don't believe I was the only one who felt this way....as my daughter and I were leaving the theatre, I noticed two youngsters fast asleep.  Not a good testimonial for a children's film.Save this one for a video rental so your kids can fast forward through the boring bits before they, too, fall fast asleep."
605,tt1979388,7,"I felt compelled to write a review, primarily because there are so many ""1 star"" reviews taking up residence on this site. Let's be frank, folks. If it wasn't Pixar, you wouldn't be whining about how ""awful"" it was.Here's the truth for those who are actually interested in seeing it: it's a pretty great flick.I would love to hop on here and tell you that everyone's wrong and it's the most amazing animated movie I've ever seen, but that wouldn't be true. I would honestly say it's near the bottom when compared to all the other Pixar films.But it's still a lot of fun. Here are the most laudable aspects, in my humble opinion:1: The animation is the best Pixar has done to this point. It's truly beautiful! They did a tremendous job of capturing the beauty of nature, from forests to prairies, and interposing an almost cheesy-looking dinosaur in the midst of it was fantastic. Don't waste your time with a DVD on this one, splurge for the Blu-Ray.2: The characters are heartwarming, and the plot is simple. Frances McDormand is especially wonderful as the mother of the simple farming family of apatosaurs, and the characters are driven by simple values like family and hard-work. I understand why many were frustrated with the simplicity of the plot, but do we always have to jump the shark in a movie? It's a fun and beautiful journey.3: It's a beautiful parody of a classic western story/film. I'm a little annoyed that the previews didn't push this aspect more, because a lot of the movie-bashing is based on the fact that people didn't get the story they expected. This is not unlike classic Disney movies like ""The Incredible Journey."" Don't expect something modern or game-changing here. This is just a twist on a classic homecoming story.I hope this preview helps dispel some of the hate. It's a fun movie, and worth a watch, even if it's not my favorite Pixar."
606,tt1979388,1,"It's pretty amazing that so many people seem to want to trash this movie. I watched this with my 2 daughters and my 10 year old said it was the best movie she's ever seen. She identified with Arlo's anxiety and insecurity as she also feels this way sometimes. His journey in dealing with these issues by facing his fears and, even if sheepishly at first, challenging them one by one helped her to understand herself. It allowed her to see that others struggle and can overcome these struggles in a way she hadn't seen before... up close and personal. As a child and adolescent therapist in practice for over 16 years, I can definitively tell you that any movie that prompts a child to look into themselves... to challenge their fears... and ends with them hugging you tightly, is a true marvel to behold. It's the core of the emotional artistry that movies are meant to be. Having an emotional connection to a movie or any work of art for that matter, will always win out over special effects and beautiful backdrops. It's the reason Star Wars: A New Hope was brilliant and The Phantom Menace sucked. Anyone have any kind of emotional connection to The Phantom Menace these days?"
607,tt1979388,1,"***WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS*** Don't believe all the bad reviews. People have sticks up their asses.The only mistake Pixar made was releasing this 5 months or so after Inside Out. This movie pales in comparison. That being said, it's a good movie. My 4 year old loves it. It's not necessarily of the same caliber as the other Pixar movies (except Cars 2; you are all forgetting that one. It is by far the worst one.)It's definitely dark and has some pretty adult elements, but it's not something a kid can't handle. It's not traumatic, by any means. Give your kids some credit. The whole theme of the movie is conquering fear, so it might do your kid some good to watch it. And stop saying it's a bad carbon copy of The Lion King just because the dad dies. How many times has that happened in other Disney movies? Stop it.I'll just say watch it and see for yourself. No, it's not as good as Inside Out, but it's a solid movie, and it stands on its own. It's worth watching."
608,tt1979388,9,"Another win for Disney Pixar. My 3&5 year old boys loved Arlo and spot. We prefaced this movie with The Land Before Time. My children were fully aware that when the first man evolved that it was a dangerous and scary place. It still is,just the predators are people mostly. I guess they aren't as sheltered as some of the other reviewers children. We laughed when they ate the hallucinogenic berries, and cried together when spot was reunited with his family.The art was absolutely spectacular and awe inspiring. All in all it is better than Planes and a little bit less than Wreck it Ralph.We have purchased it on Blu Ray to watch again and again"
609,tt1979388,1,"I'm in my twenties and to be honest, I still enjoy watching Pixar films with my family. There's just something so genuine and beautiful about their movies, not to mention the endless amount of lessons one can learn.When I initially read the reviews about ""The Good Dinosaur"", they were all so bad. It didn't stop me from watching though and I do not regret that decision. This has got to be one of the most heartwarming Pixar films I've ever seen and it tugged at my heartstrings. I was crying throughout the movie especially towards the end. The thing about being an adult, we tend to overthink something so simple. The plot isn't something grand. It's not funny. It's cute. If you're looking for a film like the classic Pixar favorite ""Toy Story"", forget about watching this. It's a really simple storyline that focuses mainly on teaching the importance of family, dealing with fears and overcoming them as well as finding oneself or making your mark in this world. View ""The Good Dinosaur"" with an open mind and just be ready to enjoy the movie without reading too much between the lines. The good thing about Pixar films is that they remind you how wonderful it is to still be a kid at heart. This movie is no exception. In fact, I think this joins the ranks of ""Finding Nemo"",""UP"", and ""Inside Out"". Everyone has a right to their own opinion, but I can't help but wonder why majority just plain dislike this movie. If you're on the fence after reading one too many 1-star reviews, I say go ahead and still watch it. Judge for yourself. Be pure hearted like a kid and try to embrace the beautiful lessons of the film. Allow it to engulf you and touch you. If you have a kid/kids, this would be one of those perfect films to have a hearty conversation with afterwards. It's very inspiring, really. Give ""The Good Dinosaur"" a try. Oh and one more thing, don't be afraid to cry while watching this. I've seen this twice and still end up a mess every time."
610,tt1979388,7,"The fact that this movie still holds a score of a 6.8 with hundreds of 1/10 scores shows you just how good it is. I'm not here to preach that it's an awesome movie, but give it the score it deserves. (It's not PIXAR's best, but still fits the bill of a good movie.)Honestly the highly negative scores are just because people were not BLOWN away. A PIXAR movie sets the bar so high, so the fact that this one isn't an A+, people are bashing just to bash.I watched this with my cousins, all at the time were under 10 ( 7 & 9 ) and nothing was too scary. Could it be over the top for 4 or 5 year old, of course, but it's not that bad. The Lion King is regarded as one of the BEST Disney films ever and there are similar scenes with death, scary bad-guys, hard times, etc. Give it a watch."
615,tt0265632,8,"Recess the TV show is about kids having fun, and teachers being teachers (good and bad). There's good character development and personality variation on the small screen and it carries well to the big screen.The movie puts the kids in the role of spies who need to break INTO school to save their lifestyle. Along the way, there are great 60's flashback scenes and songs, lots of funny spy movie cliches including the mob-scene climax.The characters are caricatures but it IS a cartoon after all. There's good voice casting (including James Wood, Melissa Joan Hart and a great sounding Robert Goulet). The plot is complicated (and just a little goofy), but my 8 and 10 year old had no trouble following the action.There are good messages about friendship, respect, integrity, duty, but these aren't done in a preachy way.The animation quality is variable. There are some great 3d zoom-sweeps, but for part of the movie the characters look like they've been singed. However, the few animation flaws are only an issue for nitpickers (like me).
See it with someone who knows that characters and likes them. It'll be a good rental or a nice afternoon in the theater."
616,tt0265632,1,"I really liked the TV series - i used to watch every episode on the Disney Channel,But i don't think the movie is quite as good as the series:For instance The writers are used to coming up with 10 minute stories, but with the movie it seems like a 10 min episode streched out to 80 minutes so i'ts not as good as i would have hoped, but the acting is still superb and very convincing. The animation is strangely NOT as good as the Series it seems very flat and uninspired. On the good side it's got a really cool story even if it could have been done in half the time & JAMES WOODS (his voice anyway) is really good as the bad guy. It has really cool 60's songs towards the end of the movie.all in all a really good movie which will delight kids and adults alike,just a shame it's not as good as the seriesmy rating 10/10 for pure enjoyment"
617,tt0265632,9,"I love the film and thought it has everything a perfect film needs.The action,the comedy and everything else that makes the actual movie great.Rickey D'sh on Collins,Ashley Johnson,Paul Willson,Jason Davis,Andrew Lawrence,Courtland Mead,Pamella Segall,Dabney Coleman, April Winchell were perfect as the voices of the characters and so was everyone else that was involved with the movie.I love watching the cartoons on T.V. and don't really think that they are for little kids.Recess schools out shows the story about 6 school friends who find out some strange goings in their school and save it from bad guys who are trying to get rid of summer vacation."
618,tt0230011,8,"I am absolutely astounded at the negative reviews for this film, both from IMDb and from the critics.I grew up watching this film as a child, and I remember loving just about every second of it. Seeing it again at an older age, it holds up just as well if not better than I remember it. Some Disney films I feel are given too harsh of treatment from critics and I feel should be held in higher regard (The Lion King II: Simba's Pride for example), but if I had to pick the absolute most underrated film (animated or not) to ever come from them, I would have to choose Atlantis: The Lost Empire as one of my top picks.To begin with, the animation is some of the best I've ever seen from Disney to date. The visuals feel so incredibly huge, they look realistic, they move fluently, the textures are amazingly detailed: One could be completely blown away by this just from the visuals alone. The scenes in the Crystal Chamber, the submarine, the fight/action sequences, they're incredible. The designs are something I can commend too. The look and feel of the city of Atlantis is very creative and awesome to look at, and I always got the sense that this was a real lost, living and breathing culture with a coherent society.Something I feel this film gets especially right is the characters: Good lord, every single one of them is memorable. Milo, Kida, Sweet, Cookie, Mr. Whitmore, the King, Audrey, I could go on for a while. Each and every one of them have their own personality traits and all have their individual moments, plus no two are alike. Each and every one of them are likable and I found myself satisfied with each and every one of them. The demolition guy I especially enjoyed. Almost every line he said was hilarious, and his personality is hugely enjoyable too.Speaking of that, that's another thing about this film: Its humor. I can't even begin to count how many moments and lines made me laugh. The writing for the humor is some of the funniest I've seen or heard, and almost every one of the protagonists has a funny line or two at some point. I think the most humorous scene for me were the ones with the demolition guy and Mole. Dear lord are they hysterical both together and on their own.But on the opposite end of the spectrum, I absolutely love the drama that's conveyed throughout the movie. The story is very well written and it held my attention through to the end. It's definitely one of the most serious animated Disney films to date, and the first of its kind to not have any musical songs. Personally, I loved this touch. While I absolutely adore the songs in many other animated films, here I think it was more appropriate not to have any. The actions scenes are spectacular, especially with the final one that takes place. The violence and the gritty realism of everything makes the physics of its world seem closer to that of the real world (Or live action if you will), and I like things like that in animated films. Many characters die (I won't dare say who or why), a lot of depression sinks in for them, they use real guns, the violence is rather high, and I think it's great. (I'm not one of those people who always drool over action and special effects like with Michael Bay films, but I digress). The physics feel real and nothing is particularly cartoony in it, so I'm very glad Disney knows that kids can still handle serious drama like that.And one other thing: The musical score by James Newton Howard is absolutely nothing short of fantastic. It could be because I'm a total sucker for chorus and choir music in movies, but the score here felt completely appropriate for the Atlantian setting. It has quite an Indonesian feel to it at times, while at other moments it has more of a Lord of the Rings influence to it, like when there's the loud choir going off in one of the major sequences. Every track has something to it, and it is one of the many Disney soundtracks I dearly wish I could buy to enjoy its full glory.In conclusion, Atlantis: The Lost Empire is hands down for me the second most underrated animated film to ever come from Walt Disney Animation Studios (Coming in VERY closely behind The Lion King II: Simba's Pride). To reiterate what I said before, I am flabbergasted at the negative critic reviews for it, plus the rating here of 6.7 when that's more than a whole point lower than it should be. Atlantis: The Lost Empire is an absolute gem in the Disney lineup easily comparable to that of The Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and so forth. It's always one of the first films I think of when I hear someone say they should revive 2D animation for all of these reasons and more.This truly is a lost classic."
619,tt0230011,1,"I thought that this film was very enjoyable. I watched this film with my wife BEFORE I had my first child.  Therefore, I was not watching it as simply family entertainment and I still thoroughly enjoyed it.  It seems as though many of the reviews are pointing out that this movie is not earth shattering, there were no unexpected plot changes and that the movie was predictable and boring.  If these people were watching this movie expecting to have a religious experience doing so, then they were obviously going to be disappointed.   This is simply an animated movie; nothing more.  If you want to see this movie simply to sit back and let yourself be entertained, you will not be disappointed.  In closing, this is definitely not the best movie Disney has made, but it IS entertaining and I do not understand the bad reputation it has received."
620,tt0230011,1,"Disney, the film name that once stood for all things innocent and suitable for all ages, has finally started to realise that to survive it needs to become more diverse. Such diversity has been very apparent in the last couple of years. Films like ""Tarzan"" and ""The Emperor's New Groove"" have made an attempt to move away from the traditional song-driven routine of Disney's past and into new, uncharted territory. ""Atlantis"" is the boldest step yet, but we have to remember: This is STILL Disney. The first ever serious film to come out of Disney's animation studio is a major achievement for them - in fact it's so serious it makes it into PG territory. Perhaps why a lot of families were scared off from seeing it this past summer.But despite the more mature subject matter, this is still a film that Disney wanted to draw in the families with, not just mature audiences, so the plot had to be kept simple enough for children to understand, but interesting enough to take it away from the realms of ""The Little Mermaid"" et al.So what we get is actually a potentially detailed plot, unfortunately suffering the blow of being condensed into a 96-minute movie. Ultimately, this is an action film about Atlantis, not about the exposition preceding it, so we are whisked through the first half hour with as many sequences bombarding the screen as is possible without losing coherency. Suspend your disbelief of how the characters get from point A to point B so quickly, you're unlikely to find an animated film that detailed coming out of Hollywood! If you want epic levels of detail in the plot, turn to James Cameron's ""Titanic"". Both films feature a boat in some manner.And let's talk about love, shall we? Yes, as with a lot of films, the lead male (one Milo Thatch, a bumbling archaeologist) and lead female (Kida, the clichéd Atlantian princess) are set to fall in love with each other. But what I found was not as clichéd as I was expecting. By film's end, for once, the characters touching/feeling/kissing sequence was far more subdued. There's various points in the film where the attraction grows, but it's just not in the ballpark of, say, ""The Little Mermaid"" (A good thing).You may have grasped that this is a rather clichéd film. Correct. You have your leading hero and heroine, backed up by more than half a dozen crew members who go on the expedition, all being given their moments during the film. Numerous other characters appear, take up the few minutes of screentime, then disappear. It doesn't take a genius to do the maths  a 96-minute film with a focus on action and visuals, and with a considerable cast, has very little time to expand the characters to any major extent. So what does it rely on? Clichés, and lots of them. Every character emulates something that has been done a thousand times before. You have the bumbling scientist, the attractive princess, the square-jawed colonel, the rich eccentric, the maniacal sleazebag, the Russian femme fatale  need I go on?I don't know why this got to anyone  I found the tongue-in-cheek nature of this film quite amusing. Alright, this is meant to be a serious flick, but do you really expect Disney to give up every single trait of their history? At least the writers have tried to come up with consistently witty dialogue, and sometimes it even is a little inspired.But in the end it's those big stunning visuals that put the icing on this cake. The CGI animation is truly amazing in places, and doesn't dwarf the characters, which was a flaw that let the recent ""Titan A.E."" down. Speaking of characters, Disney hired an outside comics industry artist to create the designs, bringing an anime style to the film. Infact the visual presentation of the film as a whole owes a lot to anime, much more so than any previous Disney outing. This resulted in a conflict with fans of the Japanese anime, ""Nadia"", for the film's overall similarities with said cartoon series. Having not seen this anime, I can't comment.With picture, there is sound. Gary Rydstrom heads up the sound team, and what a soundtrack! From the opening shot the sound stage is alive and is a treat. James Newton Howard treats us to a dynamic musical score, which compliments the film in every way, never sounding out of place and always helping to build the tension or subdue it.Perhaps I missed the point of what the creators intended. To me, the film conveys that it's an adventure thrill ride, albeit with a more serious tone than any Disney film before it. If you don't like the clichéd tongue-in-cheek attitude, then perhaps the effort that has been poured into the visuals will delight. Heck, at least the mythology is far more correct than can be said about other Disney efforts (*cough*Hercules*cough*).This is a positive, 10 out of 10 review, from someone who was blown away by this film. I always suspend my disbelief with any animated film  after all, the laws of the real world are more than frequently broken in the cartoon medium. So sit back, enjoy the ride, and perhaps everyone can find something to enjoy about this film."
621,tt0230011,8,"I thought this movie was very well put together. The voice-overs were also great. I liked how they all overcame their conflicts and reached their goals. I would recommend this movie to anyone. It was definitely worth the time and money to watch it. Atlantis has some comic scenes that made me laugh. Other scenes made me sad. And others made me glad. It is a movie any age can enjoy. From the moment Milo is the crazy ""profesor"" or until he gathers the crew up for the fantastic voyage under the sea. After I watched the movie, I read the book. It was good as well, but the movie puts better pictures in your mind. It is just like the book. But go ahead and watch this movie!"
622,tt0230011,1,"Maybe it's because it doesn't follow the typical Disney formula, but this fun, interesting, and hits on some relevant points about dreams, ambitions, and human greed. If you're looking for a dashing prince to save a beautiful princess, go watch another movie. If you want a movie that is enjoyable to watch again and again, watch this one. While character development varies, it's not hard to like the characters. Even the antagonists are likable, in the way that only villains can be. The animation style is different than most other Disney films, and personally, I like it.This is one of those movies Disney has kind of swept under the rug and forgotten about, for reasons I don't understand. Kida is not featured with the rest of the Disney Princesses, (even though she is one of many who are actually princesses within their world of origin). This is another nuance I don't understand, and it, sadly, only serves to prove just how under-appreciated this movie is."
623,tt0230011,1,"This movie was great!  It was an excellent rendition of an ancient myth. The animation was somewhat odd, but nothing new from Disney.  It was definitely better than expected for a Disney movie with no singing.
The background animation was magical.  It was a different level of work for the Disney people.  Some of the characters were a little boxy, but it was more than made up for with the beauty and lushness of the scenery.  The music was largely instrumental but that was perfect for the movie.  This was definitely not a film that needed the characters to bust into song.
Perfect.  10 out of 10."
624,tt0230011,7,"Here's what I knew about ""Atlantis"" before watching it:* - It's officially Disney's first animated sci-fi adventure.  I'm not sure how accurate that is (I like to nitpick) but it made me curious first time I heard it described.* - The preview looked, for the most part, damn cool.  Evidently, it was also ""too cryptic"" according to some critics after the fact.* - It apparently did SO badly that Disney said, ""Screw it, let's re-release 'Spy Kids'"".So, with all that said, how is the movie?Hella-cool.I'm a sucker for animated fantasy that involves stirring music and rampant special effects anyway, but ""Atlantis"" goes all out.  It's a throwback to all the CGI eye-candy shots in ""Beauty and the Beast"" and ""Aladdin"", so much so that it's almost an effects animator's Best-Of Show.  The characters maybe aren't that memorable (except, perhaps, for the ship's medical officer), and the plot's a little dull, but this isn't a movie you watch for the plot.Here's a controversy that bothers me.  The ""failure"" (as in, it ""only"" took in, like, five-hundred-million or something; I know animators who'd kill to see fifteen bucks of that) of this movie compared to the popularity of ""Shrek"" and ""Monsters Inc."" has been seen as evidence of the death of traditional animation.  I don't think that's true.  How do you account for the ""South Park"" movie?  What about ""Final Fantasy""?  Really, the story and the artistry is everything, not the method.  I don't know what Disney's comeback movie will be like, but I don't think they're out of the picture yet."
625,tt0230011,8,"""Atlantis"" is a new and right step for a Disney feature. It's a good choice to make a film by such a mysterious legend like ""Atlantis"". I didn't have any expectations for this film, but after watching it, I don't quite understand why this film got so bad reviews. Even in my country the reviewers weren't positive.""Atlantis"" is not a perfect movie, but still one of Disney's greatest, even I doubt that this film ever will get ""Disney classic"" reputation. Well, that's another case. It's funny to think that this sci-fi movie was directed by the same directors as ""Beauty and the Beast"" and ""Hunchback"" (so Kirk Wise and Gary Trousdale are trying to get away from their monster movies reputation, he he, I'm just kidding).Well, enough nonsense. ""Atlantis"" is a watchable, exiting and very enjoyable film. Even this film it's a PG-rated action-feature, it's also suitable for kids, in my opinion (parents who mean the opposite, don't kill me for writing this, he he).The story is a little predictable, but it doesn't ruin the movie. The comic book-inspired animation it's suitable for the film and set's a departure from the usual Disney-style. It's colorful, dark and detailed. The Deep Canvas sequences are pretty impressive. The film is also funny sometimes, even I more giggled than laugh through the movie. (SPOILERS) The characters of this film are also very likable, but unfortunately there isn't enough screen time to get to know everybody, so some characters are left behind (SPOILERS).The score of James Newton Howard is absolutely great. It's daring and exotic. (SPOILER) The most impressive about this film is how they're making the Atlantean language sound very natural, ethnic and authentic. It's really awesome (SPOILERS OVER)The script is tight and well-written, but still the there are some questions left unanswered in the story. But luckily there are not so much of them.So do you're self a favor, don't listen to the reviewers and watch ""Atlantis"", cause it's waiting for you..."
626,tt0230011,9,"To put it bluntly; the film, ""Atlantis: The Lost Empire"" was thrilling, wonderful, adventurous, and courageous. It was really a splendid animated film that left me standing in awe. The effects, sound, and other visual pieces of eye candy were stunningly astounding; I found myself deeply enjoying the effort it took to produce such a masterpiece, as it was greatly illustrated throughout the feature through the examples of animation, special effects, computer animation, among many other things. The voice actors and actresses were just as wonderful, and they had done an amazing job in the production of bringing the characters to life, using such brilliance and majesty. I would strongly recommend this film for anyone who adores action, adventure, and originality."
627,tt0273799,1,"This movie has Tony Hawk,Josh Peck, AND Reese from Malcolm in the Middle. This film singlehandedly made 2002 the golden age of movies."
628,tt0281373,7,"I am a little stumped at the low rating, this movie is not that bad. It is no masterpiece in any shape and form, and I have certainly seen better films, but I have also seen worse. Also it is entertaining enough and has cute moments too. I do agree the story is predictable and nothing special, the script has its weak spots and the pacing is uneven being a little too draggy in the middle. But there is a lot to redeem it, namely the amazing scenery captured by the lovely cinematography. The soundtrack was a nice touch too, the direction is good and the acting is actually above decent. Cuba Gooding Jnr is a likable enough lead and James Coburn the great actor he was matches him wonderfully. The really cute snow dogs steal the show though, it could be said they are the film. Overall, definitely not a bad movie, exceptional no, entertaining yes. 7/10 Bethany Cox"
629,tt0281373,1,"I watched this movie on one of the big networks last night, and ran across it purely by accident. Since I didn't even know the title, I had to look it up on IMDb. So, I read the other comments and decided to add my own. Sure, it was a predictable plot, but what isn't? Almost no story idea is new these days, just modified, re-packaged, and directed differently. There's still a lot to enjoy! I have to say, Cuba Gooding, Jr. was perfectly cast in his role as Dr. Ted Brooks because he's so well suited to slapstick and not just serious dramatic roles (which he excels at). I really enjoyed the way his character handled surprise situations. Being a Miami dentist and suddenly finding yourself across the continent in a completely different culture, especially in wilderness Alaska, can lead to some hilarious situations, and this movie went there. The dogs were funny (enhanced with some computer graphic features to occasionally make them humanized), and the dream sequence was good too. I also enjoyed James Coburn, who's tough guy image was perfect in this comedy role. Plus it was great to see Uhuru from Star Trek cast as Mrs. Brooks. Whatever others might say, that this movie is great for kids but dumb for adults, is just not true. As a well-educated adult, I still found it fresh and fun. For those commenter's who thought the movie was silly for just for kids: I guess some people just don't know how to have good clean fun!!"
630,tt0281373,8,"If you like dogs, if you like an adventure, you'll probably enjoy this film. Even a bit of a tear-jerker as Cuba Gooding goes to save his long-lost father! The love interest is attractive. The dogs are cute. Even the border-collie is great! My 4 yo loves the movie. We re-enact the ""Demon, save me!"" scene often. Demon is the name of the lead dog. Comical slapstick mishaps run throughout the film as Ted (Cuba) is constantly being chased by dogs, dragged through the snow, slides down hills, and suffers mild injuries. None of these are excessive, however, a few crude remarks, some adult dialogue and a suggestive image, are not appropriate for very young children. But reasonably acceptable for children age 6 and up."
631,tt0281373,6,"My mom has been bugging me to watch Snow Dogs, it's funny because she hates Disney and I'm such a big fan, but these movies are always typical and I had no interest in seeing the movie. But my mom insisted again and again, so I finally went ahead and watched it last night, yeah, it was very silly and predictable, but it was fun to watch because it's such a fun family film. It had cheesy jokes here and there, but they made me laugh, the great thing I that I really liked was that they didn't computer enhance any voices for the dogs, it was just a natural performance for them and it made the story just a little bit more believable. I know everyone keeps claiming that Cuba Gooding, Jr. ruined his career by making these films, but he must be doing something right, because at least he's still getting paid for these films.Ted is your typical Miami guy, he's a dentist, life is pretty decent for him, that is until he finds out that he's adopted. He finds out that his mother lived in Alaska, so he goes up there and finds out that his biological mother died recently, so he meets a girl, Barb, who tells him that his mother left him her house and top race winning dogs. A man, Jack, offers a lousy price for all of them, but he finds out that Jack is his father, and after hearing the story, Ted heads back to Miami. But he learns something different than Jack told him and heads back, but Jack is trapped in the mountains, and now Ted has to learn how to mush through the snow.Snow Dogs is predictable and a common story, but it's all good, it's a cute family film that has a few cute jokes. I just loved the scene where Ted first learns how to mush, and the dogs know how incompetent he is so they play a joke on him and race him through the town while he's taped to the sled. It was silly, but Cuba's look on his face was just priceless. This is a fun little movie that the whole family can enjoy, I recommend it. The rating on IMDb is very harsh, just ignore it, this is a fun film.6/10"
643,tt0280030,8,"Well, the plot isn't big like it was in the original. But I have to say, Return To Neverland was great anyway! First of all, I think I liked Peter more in this. Don't get me wrong, he was great in the original, but he was less cocky in this and I sorta liked that.I liked how it was Wendy's daughter Jane, instead of the original characters like in most Disney sequels, it was more, I don't know, realistic.Well, like I said, the plot isn't big at all, it's quite simple, but that doesn't spoil the goodness of the movie! I can see why they put it straight to Theatres instead direct-to-video, it is enjoyable!There's one scene I just loved(Note:You may not wanna read this, it may ruin it for you, that's why I put Spoiler alert on), The scene near the end,where Peter and Wendy see each other again, and she's all grown up. Seriously, it's just aw! But yeah, great movie!"
632,tt0281373,1,"In 2002, Disney was about to become a very bad company, showing really dumb shows and movies and all that. But before the change, in the early part of the year, Disney let us see some good old stuff one last time before it all went away. The first of this was ""Snow Dogs,"" which was released in early 2002. Some of the stars included Cuba Gooding Jr., who played Ted Brooks, the Miami dentist, and another star included Sisqo (who you might remember from ""The Thong Song!!!!!"")Ted Brooks, one day, received a summons to see his father in a small town in Alaska. At this point, he was shocked because he didn't know all his life until that moment that he was adopted. While there, he was asked to take care of several racing dogs, which would be used for the annual dog sledding race that takes place in Alaska each year. He also met an old man, who was a professional dog sledder; he was lost, so Ted Brooks finally learned this sport so that he can save the man just in the nick of time.""Snow Dogs"" was a terrific film. I have just watched this on Disney Channel a few days ago. This is a great movie, because soon then, Disney wouldn't be making classics like this anymore!!!!!10/10"
633,tt0281373,7,"This film has virtually NOTHING to do with Gary Paulsen's gritty book ""Winterdance: The Fine Madness of Running the Iditarod"" though he is credited with ""suggesting"" the idea for the movie. Essentially it's an amusing ""fish-out-of-water"" tale about a Miami dentist (Cuba Gooding Jr.) who inherits an Alaskan dogsled team, complicated by the fact he really doesn't like dogs. The filmmakers have relied heavily on the sunny persona of Gooding and a great deal of physical comedy for audience appeal. There are also solid support from grizzled screen veteran James Coburn and the ever-elegant Nichelle Nichols of ""Star Trek"" fame.  I enjoyed the movie & so did most of the kids I saw in the theater.  Don't know what that says about my taste in movies...One caveat: if you are severely allergic to pseudo-singer Michael Bolton, you might break out in a ""Time, Love and Tenderness"" rash!"
634,tt0281373,8,"Movie was surprisingly good. There were funny action scenes no sex, profanity or vulgarity. I watched it with my family at home. With parents and brother and friends who were around 25yrs old and niece 10yrs old and they liked it.I gave this movie 8 out of 10. I liked Cuba Goodings reactions even if they were a little over done, they were funny.I was surprised it was in fullscreen format (1:33 ratio) but I rather see this movie than live thru the awful HOSTEL movie.It was good to see James Colburn in a movie again. The Dog facial animation was kinda cool. It was done well where it didn't look too cartoonish."
635,tt0281373,1,"I don't know understand all the bad hype concerning this movie. I thought it was very entertaining but then I love dogs and in this day of fighting and killing, it was a very refreshing break. The acting may have been over the top at times,  but the dogs are the REAL stars of this movie and my daughter, who is 6, really liked it. Since most movies aren't made to be taken seriously, there is no reason to diss this one because there were too many pratfalls or at times the human stars didn't live up to the audience's standards. I found myself laughing mostly at the dog's stunts even though I know most of it was computer generated. I have a chow/husky mix named Grizz and he has alot of Demon's qualities and if he were able, he would emote those computer generated facial expressions. This is a kid's movie for the most part but considering the types of violent movies and games kids are exposed to nowadays, Snow Dogs was and still is a nice change of pace in an all too serious world."
636,tt0281373,1,"Loved this movie.  Great scenery, a happy story line with a bit of a moral, cute cute dogs.  No wonder the younger set likes it.  And the ending is an all's well that ends well with everyone happy and satisfied.  Nothing wrong with that.  And, so what if they didn't do more scenes with the dogs doctored up to laugh and talk.  Everyone who knows ""happy"" huskys know they smile all the time in real life - it's part of their personality.  So, who needs the fake stuff?  Just those who are ""not"" in the know of the husky world."
637,tt0281373,1,"My 5 month old son apparently loved this movie! He squealed in delight at numerous scenes (the dogs) which made my enjoyment of the film that much more pleasurable :-)I thought this movie was very uplifting & a great family-oriented film. I will definitely buy the DVD now that I have seen it. Wonderful scenery, beautiful dogs, & good acting, especially by Cuba Gooding, Jr."
638,tt0280030,1,"Take this review with a grain of salt, because I am a massive fan of Peter Pan and all things properly based on the James Barrie classic. This sequel, however, made me cringe. I've enjoyed liberal interpretations before - Hook and Finding Neverland, for example - but this movie completely trashed whatever character Peter Pan is supposed to have. Peter Pan is not a hero - he is a mischievous and often forgetful boy. He is entirely selfish and entirely charming, and these are his two flaws. However, in ""Return to Neverland,"" this character of ""Peter Pan"" is a mere ghost of the complex Barrie creation. Whatever beautiful messages Peter Pan has about nostalgia and childhood, ""Return to Neverland"" turns them upside down at worst, and simply ignores them at best.The animation wasn't bad, though."
639,tt0280030,8,"All you need is faith, trust and pixie dust!  This is a surprisingly pleasant sequel.  The C.G. Tinkerbelle is not as ...delicate as I remember from the first, but she is still made well and is just as spunky!  I think they did a very good job on this movie...so good of a job that I would not classify it with normal sequels.  I think it will be on the shelf with the other classics.  They still have the Tink that turns red when she's mad, and the lost boys haven't changed a bit.  Peter is just as I remember him, and in all this they did a great job.  And overall, I love this movie.  The credits did surprise me.  They reminded me of the last page in the Little Golden Books I read as a child.  Very similar artistry...very similar lay out.Also, I'd like to add that the music was actually not torture for me to listen to...which counts for a lot for my opinion of cartoons.I would not miss taking my children to this movie.  It's even a sweet date movie.I think you will like it."
640,tt0280030,1,"One thing I've noticed about most Disney sequels is that the storyline tends to be the opposite of the original. It's not different here. In the original ""Peter Pan"", Wendy has no intention of growing up too soon and instead goes to Never Land for a while, where she'll never grow up. But in ""Return to Never Land"", Wendy has grown up, gotten married and had kids of her own. Her son, Danny, who's still very young, is always intrigued by his mother's stories of Peter, but her older daughter Jane, who feels as though now her father's gone to war, she must protect her family, it means no more silly stories. And then the movie develops from there, when Jane is thought to be Wendy and is kidnapped by Captain Hook. Then, of course, Peter Pan meets her and then the story continues from there. Jane thinks she's really mature, and it's up to Peter and the Lost Boys to bring out her childish side again.I think ""Return to Never Land"" is one of the better Disney sequels, as heaps of others have turned out to rip-offs of the original. If they thought this was going to be like the others, they would've released it straight to video. So, if you have to see a Disney sequel, then this is a pretty good one."
644,tt0280030,1,"I am a 13 year old kid and I saw the movie and when I saw the war parts I was shocked and sort of felt sorry for wendy because she was in the war area but when the movie got to the where the ship is entering the second star to the right I heard sounds in that scene like: I'll get you for this pan if it's the last thing I do,ticking,and Peter famous line from ""Peter Pan"": Once you're grown up you can never back. I liked the lost boys, though in number one they used to fight alot.And pan wasn't mean to Jane he was just upset because tink's light was fading and the ending was almost sad because peter sort of felt that he didn't give a darn about wendy but she cared for him.my favorite lost boy is Slightly he rocks. Plus the songs were great I liked ""So to be one of us"" and ""now that you're one of us"" but My favorite song is the new version of ""Do you believe in magic"" it's a new version of the song then the oringal.the reason why disney wanted to do a sequal to peter pan is because they thought that we kids and adults might to see peter pan again and take us back to neverland and have us forget what's going in the world like the Terrorism war.The movie was a huge hit at my Regal cinemas in lincoln city,oregon everyone clapped and I yelled ""GIVE US MORE PAN"". Rumor has it that disney is thinking about doing a thrid Peter pan movie called: Peter Pan 3, the plot: it is going to be about peter's past,how tink came in his life,how hook and the pirates got to neverland,and how the lost boys got there too."
645,tt0280030,3,"Return To Neverland isn't terrible, but it does fail on many levels, so can't be classed as a good sequel. The animation and the story were the redeeming qualities, but unfortunately the songs and the characters fall flat.The animation is mostly bright and colourful, but falls flat in the dark backgrounds. The story wasn't bad either, trying to keep Hook from getting the treasure and everything. I also liked the war scene, because that was quite interesting on an animation perspective, and brought some intrigue on a contextual level. I was unimpressed by the trailer, but the film itself wasn't bad, but loses the charm about 15 minutes in. I will say it has a great message about cherishing your childhood.The first problem was that the kidnapping scene took far too long, despite the breathtaking animation of Hook's ship, and I hated the change to Hook. In the original and the criminally underrated TV series Peter Pan and the Pirates, which are both classics, he is complex and vindictive, but here he was manipulative in a negative way, and lacked menace. The best character was Jane, but that isn't saying much, and Peter's new voice was horrible, too bolshy. The songs were terrible and forgettable immediately after you've finished watching the movie, likewise with the dialogue. The main problem was that it isn't a true sequel at all, compared to the first film and the book. And the octopus, why replace the crocodile may I ask?I'm sorry that this is mostly negative, but Return To Neverland was very disappointing. Though better than the trailer suggested, it is still a pretty charmless film, with a 3/10(Adequate) Bethany Cox"
646,tt0280030,6,"Sequel to classic history with an enjoyable Peter Pan , adventures , imagination ,astounding as well as gorgeous sets and brilliant images , though it was originally planned as a direct-to-video release in which the protagonist of the story results to be Wendy's daughter and is set in London during World War II . The picture mingles action , feats , humor , tongue-in-cheek , fantasy and a lot of entertainment . The film centers about Peter Pan (voice by Blayne Weaver) , a nice adolescent who doesn't want grow up , Wendy , her daughter Jane and brothers . As Jane is kidnapped by Captain Hook from parents' home and they are going to Neverland . As main starring is abducted by Captain Hook and Peter Pan must come to the rescue in order to challenge his old enemy . Peter Pan , Tink and Lost Boys (they were boys who fell out of their prams while the nurses weren't looking , whereas Peter Pan is a permanent resident of Never Neverland, the lost boys are only temporary lodgers , if they seem to grow up, Peter Pan sends them home) will take on captain Hook , Smee and pirates henchmen . As Peter Pan's quest to go back Jane safely home is jeopardized until she can start to believe in the magic of imagination . The film contains emotion , humor , fantasy , songs and a lot of fun . The plot is similar to Walt Disney's classic replacing Wendy with her daughter Jane who along with Peter undertake several adventures in Neverland ; as Pan with the help of her and the Lost Boys must save his friends by battling with Captain Hook and Smee once again . From the beginning to the end the amusement and entertainment is interminable . An entertaining movie , a little tiring when the characters are singing , but is still shines . The highlights film are the marvelous images when Peter Pan and Jane are flying throughout Neverland , it turns out to be colorful and delightful . Due to controversy over their appearance in original movie , as Disney attracted negative comments for their stereotypical depiction of Indians, as indeed did J.M. Barrie with his original play , it's probably for that very reason that the Indians do not appear in this 2002 sequel , though Peter and Jane briefly visit their places , however ; as they fly over Tipis , Indian tribes and skull monument . The giant octopus was created as a new nemesis for Captain Hook because it was felt that the Disney animators had exhausted all the comic possibilities of ""Hook vs. the Crocodile"" in the original Peter Pan (1953). The octopus's tentacles make a ""Pock! Pock!"" sound that is similar to the ""Tick Tock!"" sound heard from the crocodile in the previous film . Although original author J.M. Barrie is credited, this sequel and its original were the only major films versions of ""Peter Pan"" and both of them use little of his original dialogue . Because most of the original voice cast of the movie had died, including Hans Conried (Hook) and Bobby Driscoll (Peter Pan), an entirely new cast of actors had to be used to film this sequel such as Corey Burton as Hook , Jeff Bennett as Smee , Kath Soucie as Wendy , Roger Rees as Edward , Spencer Breslin as Cubby , Bradley Pierce as Nibs and Clive Revill . Many Peter Pan purists were very upset by the characterization of Tinker Bell as a petulant and voluptuous young woman as old film ¨Peter Pan¨ as its sequel the ¨Return to Never Land¨ . The fable will appeal to adventure and classic tale fan . Rating : 6,5/10 above average . It's a terrific familiar amusement that will appeal to vintage tale fans .Other films and stage productions dealing with this classic personage are the followings : The original Broadway production of ""Peter Pan"", or ""The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up"" by J.M. Barrie opened at the Empire Theater on November 6, 1905 , it ran for 223 performances, closed on May 20, 1906, and starred nineteenth-century stage actress Maude Adams, who never made any films ; silent film ¨Peter Pan¨ (1924) starred by Virginia Brown Faire as Tinker Bell , it uses much of Barrie's original dialogue ; Peter Pan (1953) with voice by Bobby Driscoll, Kathryn Beaumont, Hans Conried ; ¨Hook¨(2001) with Steven Spielberg with Dustin Hoffman as Captain Hook , Robin Williams , Freddie Highmore , Julia Roberts , Bob Hoskins as Smee , Maggie Smith and Caroline Goodall ; ¨Finding Neverland¨ (2004) by Marc Foster with Johnny Depp as James M Barry , Kate Winslet , Kelly McDonald as Peter Pan , Julie Christie , Radha Mitchell , and recent version ¨Peter Pan¨ by JP Hogan with Jeremy Sumpter , Raquel Wood and Jason Isaac ."
647,tt0280030,1,"What a wonderful surprise!  In this sequel, Disney has managed to balance the reality of the Second World War (the blitz, in London) with the make-believe of Peter Pan.  The story is really about the difficult balance between childish wonder and youthful responsibility.  Jane is the daughter of Wendy, and, as a younger child, enjoyed the wonder-filled stories her mother told her about Peter Pan.  Now, a couple of years later, she is trying to be responsible and look after her little brother and her mother - for her father, away serving in the army.  She feels that she can't be 'a believer' and be responsible at the same time.  The movie is complemented by excellent 'background' songs which enhance the magic, and humour, drama, the quirkiness of the surreal Neverland (the octopus manages to be a little scary, but also, as amusing as the crocodile in the original) and values that appeal to parents and children alike.  In fact, having taken children to this movie on two occasions, I can confirm this is another Disney classic."
648,tt0275847,1,"This is a personal favorite of mine, and I'm actually convinced it's Disney's most underrated animated movie. I guess the main reason I like this film so much is that it features the most sincere depiction of a relationship between siblings in any Disney film. For once, we get real, flawed (and therefore all the more lovable) people - not the usual perfect Disney princesses. But it's also incredibly funny and spectacularly entertaining throughout (not to mention that it has one of the most hilarious intros in any sci-fi film ever). I simply adore this movie, and I'm not ashamed to admit it makes me cry every time I watch it. This and Sanders' and DeBlois' other masterpiece, the first HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON, are the cinematic medicine that get me through my darkest days.The look of the film is very distinct and refreshingly different from Disney's previous animated features. And the visuals are gorgeous; the backgrounds are painted in beautifully faded watercolors, and the 2-D animation is an example of artists at the peak of their craft. Every scene is jock-full of original ideas and a virtual demonstration of Chris Sanders' and Dean DeBlois' seemingly limitless imagination (the film also features a ton of clever references to sci-fi and monster films). Simply one of the best animated films - and one of the funniest sci-fi comedies - of the last 20 years.P.S.

649,tt0275847,1,"Project ""Six-Two-Six"" is deemed too dangerous by the ""Grand Council.""  A hideous genetic creation from the lab of mad-scientist ""Jumba,"" (David Ogden Stiers) project Six-Two-Six is put on board a space ship to be  banished to a nice little deserted asteroid, where he can live out the rest of his days. On the way there, project Six-Two-Six takes over the ship, and then escapes using what looks like a space squad car.  He eventually crash lands on one of the islands of Hawaii (Kauai?)  where a little five-year old orphan girl named ""Lilo"" (Daviegh Chase) finds him in a dog pound (don't ask) and takes him home as her new pet dog, ""Stitch"" (Chris Sanders).  Of course the Grand Council soon realizes what has happened, and sends agent ""Pleakley"" (Kevin McDonald) along with the mad-scientist to the island to recapture experiment Six-Two-Six.And so begins one of the most unusual and creative animated films from the Disney studios.  Featuring a completely new style of drawing, and backgrounds that look like watercolor paintings, Disney is taking a bold step in trying something a little different.  The artwork seems like a combination of ""Winnie-the-Pooh"" and Saturday morning cartoons.  The dialogue and slapstick comedy is much more reminiscent of Warner Brother's beloved ""Loony-Tunes."" Except for a handful of well chosen Elvis Presely songs, and some beautiful Hawaiian music, there are none of the musical numbers that one would expect to find in a typical Disney film.  (I, for one, didn't miss them.)We soon find out that Lilo is an orphan, living with her older sister Nani (Tia Carrere) in what could be comfortably called a ""dysfunctional"" household.  Nani is trying hard to make ends meet and be a mother to her young sister, who is having a very difficult time adjusting to life without her mom and dad.  The creators of the film do a superb job with the character of Lilo, making you identify with her loneliness and isolation without making it depressing.  They also very accurately portray the problems with an older sibling raising a younger, and the friction and fighting that results is typical of what one would find in this sort of arrangement.  The subject matter is very mature, but the animators do a fantastic job bringing it home to a level that small children can appreciate.Nani decides Lilo needs a dog to keep her company, so off to the kennel they go.  Lilo just falls in love with Stitch, the ""talking dog,"" and decides to take him for a pet.  It is with this most unlikely of characters that Lilo can find someone to confide in, to share her passions with (like Elvis), and to share the pain and sorrow that comes from being without parents.
Stitch was created by the mad-scientist Jumba to be an evil little monster, but in the care of Lilo, he realizes his own aloneness, and his need for love and acceptance.  So the evil little alien allows Lilo to take him by the hand, dress him up as Elvis, and go surfing.   (Stitch's one weakness in the inability to swim, so for him to go surfing is a surprising concession to the little girl's whims.)   His original motive for being ""nice"" to Lilo was to avoid the agents sent to recapture him, but soon he realizes that Lilo and Nani mean more to him than just sanctuary.Disney makes a point in all their trailers and commercials to show Stitch as the Rodney Dangerfield of animated characters: he don't get any respect. Other than Lilo, everyone else in the film, including his creator Jumba, is trying to capture and/or kill him.  Even Lilo's sister finds several opportunities to take out her frustrations on the mixed-up little alien. At first, it's rather amusing, since Stitch is about the most obnoxious Disney character of all time, but after a while, you start feeling sorry for the little guy, and start hoping that he can find the love and acceptance he's longing for.I've often wondered why Disney's recent animated films cannot reach the level that Pixar's CGI creations do effortlessly (""Toy Story,"" ""Monsters Inc."").  Disney's cartoons seem dull and lifeless compared to the fun and action that Pixar delivers on a regular basis.   Well, it seems as if the Disney animators are finally being infected by some of the magic that comes from their computer animation partners.   ""Lilo & Stitch"" demonstrates that there is still some life left in that old art form that Walt made so famous many years ago. But more importantly, this little gem has a lot of heart.  You find yourself caring for the orphaned Lilo, you find yourself hoping that Stitch can fin d a place in a family, and you hope that big sister Nani can find a way to keep social worker ""Mr. Bubbles"" (Ving Rhames) from taking Lilo away to a foster home.There are some really big themes being tackled in this film, such as unconditional love, the need to belong to a group or community, self sacrifice, and family unity.   The animators handles all these extremely well, and you find yourself getting a lesson in philosophy as well as being entertained.   Yet the one theme that Disney pushes in all their advertising, and several times during the course of the film, is the oft repeated phrase: ""Ohana means family, and family means NO ONE gets left behind.""  This is a theme one finds emphasized in the recent combat films ""Black Hawk Down"" and ""We Were Soldiers,"" but isn't something you often find in a animated feature!  That one little phrase, ""no one gets left behind,"" has enough philosophical and theological weight to fill a college text book. It means that everyone, no matter what you may think of them, has value, and that there is no such thing an ""expendable"" person.    A better lesson for young children would be difficult to find.My rating: 10/10."
650,tt0283084,9,"I can be a pretty cynical fella, but I had actually read the young adult novel this film is based on and really enjoyed it. The message of the book is brought to the screen and I was thoroughly impressed with the adaptation. A fine cast does great work and Ben Kingsley has a field day playing the mysterious Man In The Yellow Suit. The film is a little slow going in the beginning but all the strands and backstory must be laid out and once it gets going - the film moves with a beauty and tenderness that is rare. The music score is lovely as is the cinematography but overall, the message of the movie is what is special - it is not how LONG we live, but HOW we live. A beautiful film - for kids 9 and up."
651,tt0283084,1,"A young rich girl (Alexis Bledel) in the early 1990s, meets and falls in love with Jesse Tuck (Jonathan Jackson). The problem is that he's part of a family that are immortal.I read this book in college as part of a Children's Literature class. I love it! I thought it was just incredible. I never saw the 1980 version of this and when I heard Disney was going to redo it I expected the worst. Fortunately I was wrong. Disney made a quiet, beautiful, charming fantasy film. They don't overdo the sentimentality (as they could have) and make the story quite moving and engrossing.This is also a rare film where virtually every performance is good--especially Bledel and Jackson. But Sissy Spacek, William Hurt, Amy Irving and Scott Bairstrow also turn in very good acting. And Elisabeth Shue narrates and does an excellent job.This is beautiful--well-directed and acted with a sweeping music score. I was captivated from beginning to end. This failed at the box office but it really should be rediscovered. I give it a 10!"
652,tt0283084,7,"I'll keep it brief - I appreciate this movie a whole lot. When I got it I really was expecting something different, so for the majority of the movie I was disappointed, considered the plot and characters mediocre. But the last two minutes of the movie made me rethink the entire thing, man... I can not promise you an amazing ending or anything like that, because most people probably saw it coming, all I can say for certain is that it sure did affect me. I thought it would just be all typical and uninteresting and everything but having a meaningfully strung conclusion like that set my head straight and made me see what it was all about. Now I can't wait to watch it again. I consider this movie a well done story with good acting and a nice enough plot. It has strong aesthetic value through it's good looking images/scenery, too. Of course it made me completely depressed. The stories that are supposed to be life-affirming are always the ones that make me the most depressed, ""A Year of Impossible Goodbyes"" was supposed to be a life-affirming adventure but it's the saddest book I've ever read!"
653,tt0283084,8,"'Tuck Everlasting' is one of those sweet movies with a lot of flaws you don't care about. You could ask question after question but I did not find a reason to do so. The story about an immortal family and a young teenager that comes into their lives is probably a well known story for some audiences, but I didn't know it. The immortal family exists out of father Angus Tuck (William Hurt), mother Mae (Sissy Spacek) and two sons named Miles (Scott Bairstow) and Jesse (Jonathan Jackson). The young teenager who is taken by the family so she can not reveal their secret is Winnie Foster (Alexis Bledel).Although at first the family thinks Winnie needs to be killed, things change when Jesse Tuck and Winnie start to have feeling for one another. Winnie becomes a new member of the family. In the mean while we have Winnie's parents (played by Amy Irving and Victor Garber) looking for her. A man in a yellow suit (Ben Kingsley) is actually looking for the Tuck family but thinks he will find the girl with them as well. He knows how the Tucks have found their immortality and has plans for himself.You can probably understand how many flaws a movie like this must have. There a couple of reasons we don't really want to ask too many questions. First of all it is a good thing the movie keeps the attention in the middle of everything. It does not really focus on the reason of immortality, it does not really focus on the relationship between Jesse and Winnie and it does not really focus on the outsiders like Winnie's parents and the Kingsley-character. Although that is not a good thing in most movies it works perfectly here.Another reason you don't want to ask questions is Alexis Bledel together with Jonathan Jackson. They are sweet together, have some nice scenes. Although you sometimes see the Rory Gilmore of 'The Gilmore Girls' Bledel does a nice job with her Winnie Foster. Jonathan Jackson, who I only know from a small part in 'Insomnia', is a good choice for Jesse. This and three other respectable actors like Hurt, Spacek and Kingsley make sure the movie does not fail on that level.All this together with a very nice score and some beautiful images make this a very good movie. It is perfect for the whole family. If you can forget the flaws, forget the question you might have, you must be able to fully enjoy this."
654,tt0283084,9,"I will start by saying that I have read the book and it is one of my all-time favorites. The movie stuck pretty close to the book, right down to several quotes taken from the book. There were a few changes that surprised me. For example, in the book, Miles is a mild mannered person. In the movie, he's extremely bitter because of what happened to him due to his immortality. (Sorry, no spoilers) It was a good change.The casting was amazing. Alexis Bledel plays Winnie Foster. Like Rory on Gilmore Girls, Winnie is very serious, but wants to have fun. William Hurt didn't strike me as someone old and wise, but he portrays Angus Tuck very well. Sissy Spacek was great as Mae Tuck, showing her character's motherly side toward Winnie.Ben Kingsley plays the Man in the Yellow Suit (TMITYS). TMITYS is a great villain in the same league as Lex Luthor. He has no superpowers, but his mere presence can send super humans (immortals) running for cover. In the book, he's a vague character. He doesn't even seem to be a villain until later in the book. All we know is that he wants to find the Tucks and their spring. In the movie, TMITYS is presented as a villain, and we find out more about what he wants and how he knows about the Tucks. Bravo, Mr. Kingsley!One last thought... (I know I said 'no spoilers', so I'll be as discreet as I can.) Don't let the ending disappoint you. I told my cousin the end of the movie and she said it was a terrible ending. It wasn't terrible. One character just made a choice. I strongly recommend this movie to people of all ages."
655,tt0283084,9,"This is the best adaptation of a classic children's book I've seen in a very long time. Nearly everything in this film is just right. Of all the live-action films that Walt Disney produced in his lifetime, one he was very proud of was the 1960 POLLYANNA, and TUCK EVERLASTING reminded me of POLLYANNA in several key aspects. Like POLLYANNA, TUCK has a meticulous attention to period details (it takes place in 1914). Also like POLLYANNA, it has some high-powered acting talent in peripheral roles, with the main focus of the story on younger, less well-known actors. The cinematography is beautiful, with a rich interplay of light and shadow, and to best appreciate this aspect, you should try to see it in a theater with the brightest picture available. Like another classic children's book (CHARLOTTE'S WEB) TUCK EVERLASTING explores philosophical concepts of life and death and eternity that most adult films, much less children's films, ever touch on. I hope that TUCK doesn't end up comparable to POLLYANNA in one key area: lack of box-office success. Walt was extremely disappointed when, despite the loving attention he garnished on the film, audiences for the most part stayed away. TUCK EVERLASTING deserves to be  a huge success. Hollywood has come under frequent criticism for not making enough family-friendly films, but it seems that when a rich, intelligent film does come out, it's ignored. I hope and pray that this one won't be."
656,tt0283084,4,"Tuck Everlasting is an adaptation of an acclaimed book into a underwhelming film. It is set in the early 1900s, The Tuck family have drank from a stream which has made them immortal and they have no aged. Jesse Tuck looks 17 years old despite being 104. So far so Twilight without any vampires about.A teenage girl from a well to do family Winifred stumbles into the stream and sees Jesse drinking from there and he in order to keep the stream secret abducts her and they fall for each other as she finds out the family's secret. Why he keeps on drinking from the stream is never explained.Winnie's family feared that she is kidnapped falls prey to a mysterious man in a yellow suit who has been tracking down the Tucks as he seems to know about their secret as well.In the end Winnie must decide whether she drinks from the fountain of youth or live a normal life.The film has three Oscar winning actors in Ben Kingsley, Sissy Spacek and William Hurt. Kingsley brings a bit of malevolence as the man in the yellow suit. Scott Bairstow as Jesse's brother brings a bit of pathos regarding the curse of immortality as he saw his wife being driven mad.The film is bland and subdued. Its a bare bones story which does not work as a love story or a mystery. You have to applaud Twilight for making more from similar ingredients as it actually dealt better with a man trapped in a youth's body for decades, repeating high school every few years, not getting too close with people as they will one day age and die. Here you question what has the Tuck family done with their lives given they are immortal apart from just living life in the backwoods."
657,tt0304669,1,"This is a great family film/clean fun. Good to see with others. Fun to watch with children or as an adult. The focus of the film(plot) is clear. The characters/actors were well chosen. It wasn't too long, and it kept ones suspense. This is the type of film, I feel, that helps people better appreciate the holiday season. The film had no explicit scenes, so it could be watched with children.The focus of the film was to make one laugh and to apply the romantic need for togetherness. Excellently done..."
658,tt0304669,7,"It's been quite a while since I've seen the first Santa Clause movie, but I remember being quite surprised by it.  It was a unique twist on the beloved Santa character with great comic timing by Tim Allen.  But that was a while ago, and I didn't really know what to expect from The Santa Clause 2.The movie started off kind of slow when everything is going smoothly. Everybody's happy and Santa's meeting with his fellow ""legendary figures,"" which I admit was a fairly funny scene, but this movie just started off kind of boring.  Of course this is normal with any movie until we're presented with a conflict.  Santa is reverting back to his civilian self and must find a Mrs. Clause to fulfill the contract and continue being Santa.  So to watch over the North Pole, a duplicate, plastic Santa clone is made, and slowly turns to a maniacal boss over his elves.  I thought this was pretty funny, especially with me being a business major.  I wonder if I'll act like that after school!Anyways, back to the story, Santa goes back to his hometown with limited magic.  We're introduced to a frigid principal that has punished Santa's son for displaying some Christmas spirit.  More fun ensues as Santa tries to find and woo the next Mrs. Clause.  To seal the deal, his Santa magic gives him the edge and results in some very nice scenes of the movie.I won't go any further as you get the idea.  Overall, The Santa Clause 2 is a nice, snuggly movie that will keep you in the holiday spirit.  It's not groundbreaking material, but it has a nice message and should put a smile on anyone's face.My IMDb Rating: 7/10.  My Yahoo! Grade: B (Good)"
659,tt0304669,6,"The Santa Clause 2 takes place a number of years after the original film. The first movie saw Tim Allen's character ""Scott Calvin"" become Santa Claus after the previous Santa Claus fell off of his roof on Christmas Eve. Well in this one Scott has settled in nicely to his role as Mr. Claus, but there is one problem. He has to find a Mrs. Claus in only twenty eight days or Christmas as we know it will be over forever! On top of that major problem, another subplot includes his quest to get his son Charlie off of the naughty list. It seems Charlie has been rebellious as a teenager, spray painting school walls and such. So while Santa/Scott leaves the North Pole to take care of that business, his trusty sidekick elf Bernard and newcomer elf Curtis create a clone Santa to take over on an interim basis. Scott ends up falling for Charlie's principal Carol Newman, and with the use of magic wins over her heart. Meanwhile in the North Pole, the fake Santa that Curtis the elf created ends up becoming a power hungry dictator who believes ALL kids are bad and deserve only lumps of coal for Christmas. It's up to Scott to defeat him and save Christmas.The Santa Clause 2 is not nearly as good as the first film. While the whole idea of Santa may be absurd to many people, this film has so much more unrealistic things occur in it that it lost my interest. For example, Scott's ability to snag a wife in under a month? It's completely ridiculous but I guess had to be done to wrap up the movie very nicely. And all of the magic that he uses to make Carol fall for him goes completely unnoticed by her character, such as a mistletoe and twenty presents appearing out of nowhere. She just brushes it off. I also did not like that the major characters from the first film (Scott's ex wife Laura and her husband Neil) took a back seat in this film for the overly annoying young elf Curtis. It lost the magic and heart that the first movie had.There were some good moments in this of course. Tim Allen had some great comedic moments, especially when he ditches the Santa suit and acts like a regular person. I like him better as Scott Calvin than I do as Santa Claus. He and Carol have a good combative chemistry that turns sweet once we start to see the human side of her. And the scenes when Scott uses magic to give all the teachers toys that they loved from their childhoods really was a good piece. It just wasn't as good as the original. I thought it was ridiculous that he had to find a wife in one month. And considering that was the major obstacle in this film for the main character to overcome, I wasn't really engaged in it.Children will love this movie (I know I did years ago), and that's really all that matters with a Christmas movie. But as an adult looking for a good holiday film, this one fell flat up against others such as Home Alone 1/2, Christmas Vacation and even the first Santa Clause.6/10"
660,tt0304669,7,"OK so I admit I thought this was going to be a dud. The first one was sorta clever but a sequel... oh dear. I ended up going to watch it anyway, not entirely by choice.Well, actually it was pretty good. There were several intertwining plot lines, lots of laughs that weren't all about Tim Allen being fat and falling down, and the kids in the theatre seemed to enjoy it too. So, for what it is (clean family entertainment), it's actually pretty good."
661,tt0304669,9,"Released November 1st, 2002Director: Michael LembeckStarring: Tim Allen, Elizabeth Mitchell, Nicole Leroux, Judge Reinhold, Spencer Breslin, Wendy Crewson, Eric Lloyd, Kevin Pollak, Molly Shannon, Jay Thomas, Aisha Tyler, Michael DornPremise: Scott Calvin has been Santa Claus for the past eight years, and his loyal elves consider him the best Santa ever. But Santa's world is turned upside down when he's dealt a double whammy of bad news: not only has his son, Charlie, landed on this year's `naughty' list, but if Scott doesn't marry by Christmas Eve, he'll stop being Santa forever. Desperate, Scott turns to the elves' new invention - a machine that can replicate anything - to create Santa II and he leaves his double in charge. Things quickly go south at the North Pole when Santa II institutes some strange redefinitions of what's naughty and nice; worse, when Scott finally falls for a potential Mrs. Claus, she threatens to drive a wedge between him and Charlie. In a climactic battle pitting Santa, Charlie, the new Mrs. Claus, and the elves against Santa II and his army of tin soldiers, the future of Scott's family, the North Pole, and Christmas itself, hangs in the balance.
After a horrorific Halloween, the last thing you would expect would be a Christmas themed film. But here we are with the sequel to the 1994 smash hit, The Santa Clause. The movie opened modestly but soon gained popularity and was selling to packed houses over the Thanksgiving weekend. It just made natural sense for the Walt Disney Company to return with a sequel. The Santa Clause 2 was originally slanted for release in 2001 but the executives at Disney became aware that sequels to moderately old films won't automatically become the same hit as the original after 102 Dalmatians flopped in 2000 thanks in part to The Grinch. After the script was revised, Tim Allen finally returns as the big guy after eight years. But this time around, he doesn't have his hit TV show to bring in the sure-fire crowd like before. Will The Santa Clause 2 be as magical as the original or will the sequel follow the same steps as 102 Dalmatians?The story goes that Scott Calvin has been Santa for eight years and it declared the best Santa ever by his elves and the children of the world. But his helper elves find that they missed a clause in his contract that states that he must get married before Christmas Eve or else he will not be Santa ever again. On top of this delema, his son Charlie has been found on the naughty list for incidents at school that involve his principal, who Scott soon falls head over heels for. But he soon must return to the North Pole as the temporary toy replacement takes in new order at the North Pole. The story was very well done. It introduced all the original characters in very nice fashion and brings good attention to brand new ones like Curtis, the keeper of the Santa handbook. One of the especially good parts was how they introduced Miss Mitchell and how she soon came to be the love interest of Scott Calvin a.k.a. Santa Claus. There were little or no problems with the story that tries hard to live up to the original.The characters in The Santa Clause 2 are very funny and do a great job of bringing the audience into the holiday world of the North Pole. Tim Allen is as funny as ever reprising his famous role as the big guy himself, Santa Claus. Spence Breslin is very amusing as Curits and really shows off his mature acting abilities in a comedy, which will be needed when he appears in The Cat in the Hat with Mike Myers in 2003. Elizabeth Mitchell is great as Charlie's principal. She really brings the romance into this familty comedy that is needed to offset some of the goofiness that happens all around but doesn't draw too much attention away from other important scenes. All the original characters are back and do a extraordinary jobs returning to their old roles.Overall, The Santa Clause 2 is as funny or better then the 1994 original in many areas of the story and characters. Though the movie does seem perfect but there are slight flaws to this beautifully wrapped package. The main problem is the moral lesson expressed in the film. They are stated in lines of the film and come off as way too tacky especially with the emotional music playing. This is okay for a family audience but can get on nerves to older audience. This does not ruin the film in the least. The Santa Clause 2 does everything it sets out to achieve and does so with great flare. If this film does well enough, you might expect another sequel but even if this is the last chapter in the Santa Clause films then it goes off on a fabulous note. If there is one holiday film to take your kids to see this November, take them to see The Santa Clause 2. You won't forget it and neither will your kids after they are done laughing their heads off. And no worries for adults, the jokes appeal to both children and adults. Look for hidden Disney jokes and even a few Buzz Lightyear lines slipped into the story. One of the few films that lives up to the original.My Rating: ****1/2 out of 5"
662,tt0304669,7,"***** spoilers ahead! *****This movie had me laughing and moved me almost to tears a couple of times. There are some who have not given this movie a good review, don't listen to them.  Tim Allen was great, his co-star (what's her name?) was great. This was an excellent feel good movie for the holidays.  I liked it better than the first one.  The thing with the reindeer talking by making noises was very funny.  I also liked the parts with the other characters from legend... Mother nature, Tooth Fairy, Father Time etc.  Go see this movie, you will not be wasting your time."
663,tt0304669,7,"Saw the first one as a child, saw the second one as an adult.  Just so I don't spoil the magic, I will say only the following:  Tim Allen was excellent as Santa... he made me feel like I was ten again.  The character Bernard was just as bossy as I remembered from the first film, but the quips he fires off were in shorter supply.  I missed the sarcastic humor I associate with him.  Charlie is growing up, but in the best way possible. He had some touching lines near the end to a new character-- I won't ruin the surprise of whom.Yes, there was an inappropriate flatulence joke in the movie, but all in all that was the only concession to bathroom humor in an otherwise classy family comedy.  Yes, there were plot holes, some of which were large enough to drive a sleigh through, but after eight years and five writers, the end product was satisfactory.On its own: 10/10 for combined effort and execution.  As a sequel: 8/10. Good character continuity, interesting new spin.  I'm happy to say I didn't spot large amounts of rehash.Recommended for:  families with small children and college students old enough to remember the first ""Clause"" and just need to de-stress around midterms or finals."
664,tt0133240,8,"Upfront, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie beyond what I thought I would take from it. Being an animation major I can thoroughly pick apart most movies, especially what Disney puts out now-a-days. Unfortunately for their movie Treasure Planet, either it was ahead of itself ambitiously, or it was rumors that spread like wildfire (when it was being released) that killed it. Actually, that's why I didn't see this film until very recently, because of everyone's (and mine at the time) prejudice against Disney features springing up amongst way too many viewers, and especially for this film. I believed them that this film was terrible, and subsequently never got to see it until a week ago. Man, everyone was wrong.I'll be honest, and give it its weak points: The main character (Jim) is quite blank and not very well developed. Which is bad because an audience cannot connect to a flat, central character. Secondly, the CG (although very well stylized) I think didn't mesh as well with the 2D animation as it should have. Other than that...you might pick apart a few other things about the movie (and no, the dialouge isn't that bad. it's a G rated movie...it's not supposed to be incredibly complex).Treasure Planet keeps pretty tight in line with the original classic, ""Treasure Island"", even when softening it down for a younger audience. I grew up with that story, and had no problem with the adaptation in Planet. Also, this film contains two masterfully animated characters, John Silver and Dr. Dilbert Doppler (animated by two masters, Glen Keane and Sergio Pablos, respectively). If you're an animation enthusiast, these two are gold to watch (especially the pencil tests in the special features on the DVD).This whole review is a little long-winded, but in closing, this movie is more than what was said of it. If anything dealt the killing blow in this movie failing at the box office, it was everyone's bad word for it. Not true. Please see for yourself!"
665,tt0133240,8,"Cast yer sails matey...we be blastin outta these worlds! It was all good: cast,script, music, and the effects animation was the BEST! So why the rate of 8 then, well I really didn't like B.E.N.'s personality, but I'm sure others out there will love him. There are plenty of funny moments, endearing moments (without being sappy), and just the right touch of suspense to keep you hanging on. I was so glad the romance was played down for once, along with those endless Disney love songs. The one scene in the movie that is accompanied by song is such a score! Completes the scene of who Jim is and how he feels with just that one song. Bravo Johnny Rzeznik! I plan to go out and buy this DVD. I only wish I could have a Morphy on my computer to play with; Disney missed the boat big time on that gold."
666,tt0133240,8,"Robert Louis Stephenson's `Treasure Island' has always been one of my favorite classic stories.  The tale of a teenage boy thrust into the adventure of a lifetime features pirates, swordfights, an ocean voyage, betrayals, and buried treasure among many other classic adventure-story ingredients  what's not to love?It's been filmed countless times before, in many various incarnations, including one with the Muppets and an animated version starring the Monkees' Davy Jones; so what new way can be thought up to retell this hundred-year-old story for twenty-first century audiences?Set it in space, of course;  a brilliant idea that pays off handsomely.To be fair, TREASURE PLANET is not the first film to set the story among the stars; that distinction belongs to the 1987 Italian live-action TV Mini-series TREASURE ISLAND IN OUTER SPACE. But that version has scarcely been seen outside of Europe, and I seriously doubt that it could hold a candle to the stunning visuals seen here.And the key word here is VISUALS.  This is arguably the most visually stunning animated film to come out of the powerhouse Disney animation factory, EVER.  The canvas on which they paint here is wide and broad, and full of breathtaking color and beauty.  Pirate ships with solar sails soar across a canopy of stars, and behemoths that look like whales trumpet along beside them.  Alien beings both friendly and fierce populate the universe, and futuristic machinery stands side-by-side with nineteenth century technology.  I've never seen anything quite like it.Oh, and there is a story here as well; amazingly, it is quite faithful to the source material in both outline and details, only deviating from the text where necessary to transplant the action from the oceans of nineteenth century Earth to the planets and solar systems of the future.It centers around Jim Hawkins, a fatherless boy constantly getting into trouble with the law for his rambunctious, extreme-sports ways, who gets the chance to prove himself when a dying pirate leaves him a treasure map with his dying breath.  In short order he finds himself cabin boy on a stargoing vessel bound for the legendary Treasure of a Thousand Worlds; along the way path is blocked by pirates and collapsing stars and other perils of interstellar travel.If I have any complaint at all with the film it would be that it sticks a little TOO close to the novel, some of the nineteenth century ideals just don't ring true in the futuristic setting; but that's easily forgivable compared to the wondrous images this magic film offers."
674,tt0323642,8,"Pooh rocks! This film is great just like the others. I nearly cried when Pooh lost Piglet's scrap-book. This film is cute just like all the others and I have a friend who thinks Pooh cares more about his honey than his friends, which this movie prooves is false.Piglet feels left out because of his size and runs away. Pooh, Tigger, Eeyore, Roo and Rabbit are concerned and look for him using his scrap book. Along the way they learn that Piglet is a big part in their lives and that they took advantage of him. In the end Pooh is almost killed, but Piglet saves him. This film is good and is underrated just like all the Pooh films!Plus, Carly Simon ain't half bad at singing the songs.POOH ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
667,tt0133240,1,"When this film first came out, I was quite a bit skeptical, given what I thought was another lame Disney storyline like Atlantis, Emperor's New Groove and Mulan, and opted out of seeing it in theaters. Now 3 years later I was curious to see what it was all about, so I gave it a chance and rented it. To my surprise, I was blown away by the brilliant animation and complex storyline (going beyond the book), and wondered how this film could have been so overlooked. The coming of age story about a teenage boy deals with real issues in today's world, and how each of us has our own potential to reach. I also loved the score and the music by John Rzeznik. The only complaints I have is that Jim looks much older than his supposed age (15), perhaps 17 or so, and that the robot was obnoxious and shouldn't have been added in at the end. All in all, I'd have to put this on my list of favorite Disney films since The Lion King and Pocahontas."
668,tt0133240,7,"Treasure Planet is the adaptation of the classic swashbuckling children's tale of Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson. R.L.S originally wrote Treasure Island chapter by chapter for his son, as a bed time story for each night. When the story was first published it was actually condemned by some! Claiming that such violent tales encouraged boys to become ner-do-well's such as the pirates it glorifies! Suffice to say, Disney's futuristic adaptation fails to capture the rebellious nature of the original Treasure Island. Fans and fanatics can gripe all they want if a scene is missing from the book, or if a character's been changed, but as long as the core meaning of the story remains, it's essence. Then adaptation has been successful. Treasure Planet does not capture the essence of the book entirely, in fact it lacks a lot of it's power due mainly to the protagonist. Jim Hawkins of Treasure Planet does not suffer as much as his archaic counterpart, therefore his character does not under go the same heroic journey and does not emerge as profoundly changed as R.L.S original did.Aside from that, Treasure Planet makes for a fine adventure film for the whole family. There are moments of joy and pathos to be found throughout. And it is interesting to see a science fiction twist on a pirating classic."
669,tt0133240,8,"Everyone show watch and buy this movie if for no other reason than to support Roy Disney against Michael Eisner!!This poor movie suffered from political mudslinging between these two. As ""Treasure Island"" was one of the Disney company's first and most successful live-action pictures, Roy had always been passionate about making an animated version. Eisner, ever Roy's opponent, was in charge of the advertising budget. So, when Treasure planet was released, without any typically ""Disney"" fanfare, it met with unsurprisingly small attendance.The day after it was released, Eisner held a press conference, declaring ""Treasure Planet"" a flop, and blaming it for Disney's poor 3rd quarter performance. Roy promptly quit the company his uncle and father had built.As far as the movie itself goes, the controversy robbed what I think is the finest example of a ""Disney"" movie since Mulan. The animation is spectacular, the vocal talents are superb, and Brian Murray is one of the greatest Long John Silvers I've ever heard.But beyond the technical qualities, ""Treasure Planet"" captures the spirit of Disney much better than recent Disney debacles (see Valiant, Chicken Little, Home on the Range). I think the end product came out very nicely, and, larger than that, I think Walt would have been proud to put his name on this one."
670,tt0133240,9,"I loved T.P from the first time I saw the preview. I went to see it with my friends and we were just dazzled by the brilliance of the story. (sorry about my cruddy spelling)I instantly took a liking to young Jim Hawkins and the charming John Silver, and fell in love with the wonderful animation. It's been three years since the movie came out, and I'm still crazy about it. I've watched it over 300 times. It is truly wonderful and I'd recommend it to anyone who likes real honest to god animated movies. About the Disney's biggest flop thing, chill out people. That's no reason not to watch the movie. It's simply a mater of opinion. If you don't like the outer space theme, or whatever, then don't watch it. Just don't go around discrediting it....There are fans of the movie out there, lots of them, so just CHILL! Hope I was at least a little helpful! -Blackbird"
671,tt0133240,1,"This movie, even though given a bad rap by the critics, happens to be one of the best movies in the world. If you have not seen it, step away from your computer and rush out to get it. I don't wanna see you till you have that movie. Got it? Good now watch it. This movie's amazing graphics, twisting and riveting storyline, although based on the book Treasure Island it has many changes, including story changes, characters, and its planets not islands. Its amazing even though made by Disney anyone from age 10-100 can love this movie! The final sense with Silver and Hawkins is amazing and yet, in a way a bit sad. (That might have been a spoiler thats why I checked Spoiler) I also Loved the Music, it was amazing. The greatness in the whole film was flawless. The song ""I'm still here"" by the goo goo dolls was spectacular. I could not find anything about this whole film that did not make me smile, with the voices fitting the characters perfectly, and the amzaing graphics! This was a amazing film by Disney. It would make Robert Louis Stevenson proud, especially for the name of the ship the RLS Legicy; or the Robert Louis Stevenson Legicy. You could really feel Jims struggle, and Silver's emotions. I could not find one flaw with this movie! I gave it a 11 out of 10."
672,tt0133240,1,"Let's put it this way, with no fan-girlish outbursts (Which is pretty hard). This movie has pretty much everything required of a superb movie.As is the case of most Disney movies, there is a light-hearted side and a serious side, but this movie is slightly more serious (my preference). This movie has so much heart and a lovable cast of characters. I don't think it was completely for teenage boys, it just centered around one with a situation that is sadly familiar with many of us.The atmosphere is such an imaginative one, who cares if you can't breathe in the vacuum of space? (The book from Disney explains that this is a kind of parallel universe.)Nebulae, galaxies, comets...they all are stunning with these 18th century ships. I personally think that most spaceships look rather alienating.The soundtrack may be drowned out at moments, but the times you hear it, it fits well. The song by The Goo Goo dolls' lead singer is perfect for Jim, and the sequence in the movie is more worth watching than the music video! And the story! I think the depth, connections and growth of the characters are certainly levels above Treasure Island, thanks to the Disney touch. (I really don't want to spoil anything.)Just buy it, if you haven't over the last three years."
673,tt0133240,1,"Does it really matter what the ""professional"" critics think? My 5-year old's opinion is the only one that counts to me. He loved it and wants to go back again. He thought it was wonderful that ships could fly and never doubted that it was possible. Even though I took him to a late viewing he stayed awake and that is the best rating of all....."
675,tt0306841,5,"The Lizzie McGuire Movie is a nice film to watch if you have nothing better to do as its harmless entertainment. Lizzie McGuire and her pals Gordo, Kate and Ethan all pack their bags on a class trip to Italy. Once there, Lizzie is mistaken for pop star Isabella and begins to falls for Paolo, who is Isabella's ex-boyfriend. When Lizzie's mom, dad and brother Matt get wind of this, they all jet their way to Italy. While, Lizzie is transformed from a normal teen to a beautiful pop star. The plot follows the last episode of Lizzie McGuire and this film is pretty much just another episode. I do watch the TV series sometimes and its not a great show but it isn't terrible either. Hilary Duff stars as Lizzie and she does a good job of playing her. Many people claim that she is a terrible actress but she does have some charm in the roles she plays. Most of the cast from the show appear in the film except for Lalaine. Adam Lamberg plays Gordo and I think he does a good job, kind of an annoying character though. Robert Carradine and Hallie Todd play Lizzie's parents. They both do a good job but don't really appear in the film very much. Some other characters that appear are Matt, who is Lizzie's brother and Kate, who is Lizzie's ex-best friend. There are a couple of new people in the film as well, like Alex Borstein. She steals the film and gives a funny performance. Yani Gellman plays Lizzie's love interest and I thought he did a poor job but it was his first major role. Jim Fall directs this film the same as if it had been a regular episode so don't expect anything out of the ordinary. While, I did enjoy the movie, at times it felt like it was just made for money purposes and not entertainment value. It does feel sitcom-Ash which isn't surprising. Though that sometimes does get annoying. It was predictable but that was expected. It was kind of cheesy at times but its still good fun. It wasn't made to win Oscars, it was made so its audience could have some fun and I think most people will. It's a short, inoffensive film and just don't expect too much. So if you like the show then you will probably like the film since it's the same. If you hate the show then you should just skip this movie. In the end, this is harmless entertainment that wouldn't hurt you if you watched it. Rating 7/10"
676,tt0306841,7,"Why is the rating for this movie only 4.8/10? Yeah, it's not exactly first-class entertainment, but it definitely deserves at least a 7/10. It's good, clean fun, and very entertaining for children and adults alike. It's Lizzie McGuire (probably the only decent programme on the Disney Channel - oh why did they stop it?) and her pals having an adventure in Italy! But whilst this is just an ordinary Roman history trip for everyone else, Lizzie gets whisked away to stardom when she meets Italian popstar, Paolo Valisari. Full of friendship problems, other catastrophes, Matt and Melina's usual (international) shenanigans and a little bit of (clean) romance, the Lizzie McGuire movie fails not to entertain. It's the perfect film to watch on a rainy day (or whilst driving through hot, remote areas of Turkey in a coach - that's how I watched it)."
677,tt0266543,9,"I have enjoyed most of the computer-animated films made so far, ranging from Pixar films like ""Toy Story"" and ""The Incredibles"" to DreamWorks films like ""Shrek."" But ""Finding Nemo"" is the one that remains unparalleled, not because of its comedy or creativity, both of which are equaled in the ""Toy Story"" movies and in ""Monsters Inc.,"" but because it truly, more than any of the previous computer-animated features, reinvents the genre of the children's animated film.Humor in traditional animation is usually based on broad slapstick and physical exaggeration. There are occasional nods to this brand of humor in ""Finding Nemo,"" as when a flock of seagulls ram into a boat and we see their beaks crowing on the other side of the sail. But such sequences only call attention to how far this movie generally departs from old cartoon conventions. Instead, the movie invests its world of sentient animals with a surprisingly scientific texture. All of the animals are based on real species. The fish tank is constructed out of real devices. There is a strong sense of locale, as Marlin (Albert Brooks) travels across the Pacific to Australia, where even the animals speak with an Australian accent. In a scene that I'm sure Gary Larson of ""Far Side"" fame loved, a pelican discusses with a group of fish the intricate details of dentistry. The fact that the animals talk and understand what's going on is treated as though it were a natural feature of the world. The realism is so striking that by the end of the film, you'll almost believe it possible for fish to plot an escape from a tank.Far from making the film pedantic, this approach results in an intelligent but still entertaining picture. Most of the humor is based on parodies of human behavior: repentant sharks start a club that's like Alcoholics Anonymous, a school of fish act like obnoxious DJs while forming themselves into spectacular patterns, and a four-year-old girl behaves like most kids that age, oblivious and destructive. The manner in which Marlin finds his way to his son is so inventive that we can forgive the film for the number of coincidences involved.The story employs the same basic formula used in ""Toy Story,"" in which two characters, one uptight and the other clueless, are thrown together as they're forced to journey through a world populated by creatures that are a lot more knowing than the humans realize. This movie, however, creates a unique character in Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), a fish with short-term memory loss. To give a cartoon character a real human disorder is risky, to say the least, and I'm glad the filmmakers didn't lose the nerve to include this ingenious device, which not only generates some of the film's biggest laughs, but reinforces the character interaction that is so central to the story. This is in fact the only Pixar film to feature true character development. In the course of his voyage, Marlin learns to be more adventurous, getting parenting tips from a surfer-dude turtle voiced by the film's director Andrew Stanton, while his son Nemo learns to be self-reliant.Of course, none of the sharks, jellyfish, whales, gulls, pelicans, lobsters, and humans that Marlin encounters along the way really mean any harm. They're just doing what they do. As Nigel the Pelican tells Nemo at one point, ""Fish gotta swim, birds gotta eat."" That's perhaps the film's most interesting insight, that there are no true villains, just creatures that act according to their nature, and a few that transcend it."
678,tt0266543,8,"I'll be totally honest and confirm to you that everything what they say about this movie is true. It's a brilliantly animated masterpiece with lots of humor that actually works and a plot that really brings tears to your eyes from time to time. The modern artists of Pixar never cease to amaze the audience in expanding their horizons. Finding Nemo is visually stunning and you can have nothing but respect for the people who created it.
I was more or less skeptic about watching it, because it was so overhyped ! Two days before it got released in my country, the TV and press loudly announced that the DVD broke all records in the USA during its first release-day. That's usually a sign of being typically mainstream and fake...but Finding Nemo is not. I'm allergic to fake sentiment and pathetic feel-good movies but I was really touched by this one. The moral and valuable life lessons are always present, but they're not shoved down your throat or thrown in your face all the time. This movie really relativates itself and that's important for a good comedy. And it's hilarious !!! Every side character in Finding Nemo (and there are a LOT of them) is exceptional and worth a mention. And the voices are cast perfectly as well...like the voice of Willem Dafoe for Gill, for example...a perfect choice. The character of Dory ( speaks through the voice of Ellen DeGeneres ) steals the show. She's an adorable blue fish who suffers from amnesia. She forgets what she's doing or going to every five minutes and that really leads to hilarious situations. Movies like this aren't just being made for children exclusive... They're good for everyone to realize you have to entertain yourself from time to time and just to enjoy the little things in life. I recommend this to everyone in the world. No matter if you're 9 or 99 years old, Finding Nemo will bring a smile on your face and leave behind a warm feeling in your heart."
679,tt0266543,1,"Marlin, a nervous and neurotic clownfish is heavily overprotective of his son Nemo, who only wants to explore the sea in its entirety. When Nemo gets caught by a scuba diver and taken away, it is up to Marlin to swallow his own fears and find Nemo. The ensuing search and rescue organized by the him is a mass effort by swimming and flying creatures of all sizes and personalities, such as a threesome of vegetarian sharks, a fish with short term memory and an aged turtle, all helping him realise the error of his ways in restricting himself to just his home.As charming as it is beautiful, Finding Nemo is a joy, both visually and cinematically. The characters are all so appealing and sweet that you want to hug each and every one of them, Nemo and Dory in particular. But the film transcends above just a generic animated film, for there are lessons to be learnt by it too. The film often tells a children's tale from an adult's point of view, with risky situations and emotional soul-searching putting stress on a disjointed family.The sea is brought to us in such a memorable and unique way that there is brilliance and beauty in every frame. The animation is of all time high for Pixar, and the sound mixing and editing are also to be credited, as they capture the heart of the sea creditably. But perhaps the best thing about the film is the musical score by Thomas Newman. He creates the essence of the sea, as well as the emotions felt by the fish throughout. Note the masterwork that occurs as an upbeat, jovial number quickly escalates into something darker in a matter of minutes. In short, the music is superb.The voice cast are capable and cannily chosen, from young Alexander Gould as the naïve Nemo, as well as Albert Brooks as the bumbling Marlin. But the star of the show is Ellen DeGeneres as Dory. As the forgetful but caring fish, she is sweet and soulful, and provides much of the comedy of the film. But the humour is also provided by the great script, which delivers a potentially dull story with wit and soul, and shies away from the sentimentality that could so easily arise of a Disney film. And the jokes, what jokes  from satire, spoof and slapstick, they'll be a one-liner for everybody here.Gorgeous to look at and utterly adorable, Finding Nemo sets the standard for how animated movies should being terms of entertainment value as well as story and themes  ending with the touching, thought-provoking message of how too much protectiveness on the parent's side will repel, but, no matter how independent a child (or fish) believes themselves to be, they'll always need their parents."
680,tt0325980,1,"I am nearly fifty years old. A sober grown man. With children. Children with whom I have now sat through hundreds of movies. Many of which I have enjoyed. And I am not completely hardened in my sophistication. The opening music to The Lion King brought tears to my eyes when my little ones were but wee tots. But still, these are after all just children's movies. In another life, I would never have seen them. And, really, one can't take such movies too seriously, can one?And so, this summer, after the ritual badgering, I dutifully trudged into yet another Disney ""adventure"" movie. Named after that tired old ride in Anaheim I first went on in 1965. I mean really, how much can you expect?And then, it happened. The swirling intoxication. The stunned feeling. What? Who? How? Was this a movie? Or a religious experience? Perhaps more like an addictive experience...I cannot remember ever willingly paying to see any movie not starring a relative of mine more than twice, and I can count those movies on one hand. I have now seen ""Pirates"" four times. The only thing keeping me from seeing it again is the sense that this whole thing is just getting out of hand. I cannot get enough of it. It's like walking into a painting that you never want to come back out of. My children ask, with a note of concern in their voices, ""Dad, you really like Pirates of the Caribbean a lot, don't you?""And that Depp fellow. My God. I never had any idea who he was, but his name sounded like something created for a pubescent cover-boy for magazines published to hook thirteen year-old girls on make-up and bad music. Wasn't Depp the name of some hair-goo product back in the 60s?I am a straight male. I have several good friends who are gay, but have never fantasized about any gender but the female. But now I understand how women can experience swooning crushes on male film stars. He is simply extraordinary. So sly, so seductive, so canny! I read an interview in which Depp said he went through a slight depression when he had to stop playing Captain Jack Sparrow. I can see why. His inventiveness and sheer pleasure in inhabiting the character come through in every frame. How can I admit to my children that I now troll through fan websites about a former teen heart-throb?I often don't even watch the Academy Awards, and I certainly never have any emotional investment in who wins.Except for this year.Go Jack.And, in a time when many big-budget movies are little more than a hodge-podge of loosely- connected ""money shots"" this movie puts all the pieces together, with a sense of fun and light-heartedness in special effects that are simply dazzling. I find myself laughing with dizzy appreciation when Barbossa barks out, ""You'd best be believing in ghost stories, Miss Turner, you're in one!"" and the grinning skeletons come into view, with Badelt's pounding score keeping time to the beat of their maniacal deck-swabbing. And then there's the scene of the pirate-ghouls slithering up from the darkened sea on the mooring cables of the Dauntless, like infernal cats stalking their prey.And now to the music. I can just hear the effete aesthetes dismissing this score, as Mr. Zimmerman anticipates with his winking ""overproduced by"" credit on the cover-liner. ""Bombastic."" ""Overdone."" ""Absurdly Stupendous.""Well, perhaps it is, for those who spend their lives evaluating such things. To me, it is absolutely transporting. I first listened to it while doing a work-out on a rowing machine and found that I tripled my usual distance. It was like mainlining some hazardous tachycardic amphetamine.Once again, the children were wondering, ""What's up with Daddy? Is he OK?""Perhaps I am just losing my grip, having an adolescent movie get to me this way. But when those final credits roll, and Captain Jack narrows his eyes and says, ""Now, bring me that horizon. Drink up me hearties, yo ho"" and the music swells ... it is difficult to put into words the effect it has.At this point my children have to yank me forcibly from the theater, lest I persist in watching the credits to the bitter end, and bid good-bye to the little monkey once more, wiping tears of exultation from my eyes.This is not just another ""entry"" in the summer blockbust sweepstakes. It is an exquisite work of fantasy and inventiveness, a true classic, on the order of ""The Wizard of Oz."" I do hope Depp's performance garners not just awards, but a place in the pantheon, something we old fogies -- and our gently fogeying children decades hence -- will show to our children and grandchildren like a revealed treasure. I cannot recall any movie having such an effect on me."
681,tt0325980,1,"Awesome action and swashbuckling adventure, great music from the likes of Hans Zimmer, good visuals and Johnny Depp's hilarious improvisational performance as Captain Jack Sparrow (the other performances are good as well but Depp's the highlight and you damn well know it) make the first Pirates of the Caribbean adventure a fun action flick that's not only a great first non-Touchstone/Hollywood Pictures/pre-2006 Miramax & Dimension PG-13 Disney movie but also a much better movie than a movie based off of a THEME PARK RIDE has the right to be."
717,tt0353965,1,"I don't know how I missed this film when it came out but I watched it tonight and was blown away. This is an unbelievably beautiful film that shows some of the most amazing places on out planet. It doesn't bog you down with a lot of narration and lets you just experience the beauty. I loved how different peoples were able to speak of how they interpret the earth and all who reside on it. As someone who has every convenience it's refreshing that people are so happy with nothing but love and respect for nature and one another. This is something that our planet desperately needs right now and the more people who understand what life is truly about, the better chance we have at survival.

682,tt0325980,9,"You will always remember this as the movie that made Johnny Depp a superstar and almost got him an Oscar.The fact that he didn't win isn't a problem,since thanks to him this is the best pirate film ever made.The opening concept is a clichè:a beautiful woman(Keira Knightley)is kidnapped by a bunch of filthy pirates(led by Geoffrey Rush's Barbossa)and the man(Orlando Bloom)who's desperately in love with her decides to track them down.From now on,things get unexpected,as he asks another pirate for help.And it's no ordinary pirate:it's Captain Jack Sparrow(Johnny Depp),a lying,cheating,but charismatic scumbag,the hardest man on Earth to predict,not to mention quite unlucky and clumsy(""You are,with no doubt,the worst pirate I've ever heard of"" ""But you HAVE heard of me!"").It's got all the elements of a classic pirate movie,elements that would give this flick a 9/10.So,why am I giving it a 10/10? The answer is simple:Captain Jack.From the moment he makes his entrance,justly included in the Empire Top 10 Entrances of all time,we know he's the reason people will keep watching the movie.He 's Depp's best non-Tim Burton-character ever,and I can't wait 'til he returns.See you next summer,Captain!"
683,tt0325980,8,"Although I had expectations ( from watching the trailers ) that this might be a good movie, I was still surprised that it's as good as it is. The story is actually more complex than I had expected, involving cursed pirates and their quest to rid themselves of the curse. I won't say more than that so as not to spoil it if you haven't seen it.There aren't as many action scenes as I had thought there would be in a pirate movie, but the ones that are in the movie were very fun and enjoyable. After seeing it, I think it had the right balance of action and drama. There are also, of course, a lot of funny bits interspersed between the action and drama. Some really good special effects also add to the enjoyment of this movie.I wasn't much of a fan of Johnny Depp until I saw this movie. I think he deserved to win the Academy Award for best actor. It's largely because of his performance, IMO, that the movie was so good. Most of the supporting cast did well, mind you, just that Johnny Depp stood high above the rest. I did find Orlando Bloom's performance a bit wooden, but other than that the acting was good.Basically, it's a really fun movie and I'd give it about 8 out of 10"

I have liked Lohan since ""The Parent Trap"" and if she decides to stay with acting she might go on as long as Jody Foster has in the business. Lohan has one thing that actors like Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts have and that is an expressive face. Acting is so much better when the actor can add to their part through the expressions in their face and Lindsay can do that.Watching the movie was a delight for me. I never got the feeling that 35 year old men wrote the script (they didn't) like I do with some of the ""teen"" movies out today.The music used by the movie band ""Pink Slip"" was above average and the other soundtrack music fit the film as well.Now if they would just do a big budget ""Herbie the Love Bug"" feature, I would be even more happy."

The shots of natural wonders, and natives doing their thing (hunting, cooking, dancing) are interspersed with fast-action scenes of cars zooming on throughways and people scurrying, which provide a stark contrast between living in harmony with nature and being in a rat-race.

If Lohan, a teenager, could be an adult so well, that's rather scary. I thought at most times Lohan was Tess, but Curtis was having too much fun as Anna to really be thought of as great. Instead of acting like Lohan, Curtis just acts like a young kid who just ate too much ice cream.One part of Freaky Friday that I didn't like is how often we were put in an awkward situation. And when they were there, they just didn't seem plausible. All of a sudden, Anna-as-Tess is a guest on a talk show, talks to someone she has a crush on, and watches Tess-as-Anna perform?

694,tt0328880,9,"I didn't go out of my way to see this film, as it had already been pretty much disregarded by both the critics and the public.  Shame on me.  BROTHER BEAR has many strengths to recommend it, and I hope it eventually finds an audience on video.I'll admit a bias: I live in the Yukon Territory, and the story obviously takes place in next-door Alaska (with characters named ""Sitka"", ""Kenai"", and ""Tanana"", it's pretty obvious).  Like many other Disney movies, it takes its inspiration from a traditional legend.  Unlike many other Disney movies, this movie manages to remain respectful to the original legend.The messages are wonderful.  That love is an important thing for a real man to learn.  That ""the spirits"" need to be respected.  That vengeance can have a terrible price.  This movie manages to do it (mostly) without resorting to daffy sidekicks and sappy tugs at the heartstrings.  Yes, there's Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas revisiting their ""Bob and Doug Mackenzie"" roles as the two moose, but I didn't find them jarring at all.  The story works.So does the animation.  This is a visually beautiful film.  Yes, it's apparent to my (computer pro) eye that Disney's animation unit is making more use of computer techniques.  Mostly, though, you see them used to wonderful effect, like making a realistic snowfall, or moving the point of view through a shot.  The animation style is also very appropriate for the story.  And as a northerner, I loved the many aurora shots; they looked spot-on.Not everything in BROTHER BEAR worked for me, unfortunately.  Phil Collins' music for TARZAN was quite good, but it mostly falls flat here (except maybe for ""On My Way"").  A couple of numbers come close to the embarassingly bad category.Still, this is nowhere near enough for me to disregard this movie.  I put it above THE LION KING (way above), probably a little ahead of TARZAN, and almost on the same upper-echelon with THE LITTLE MERMAID and BEAUTY AND THE BEAST."
695,tt0328880,1,"Disney's penultimate traditionally animated feature proved to be one of its best. The film is loosely based on the mythology of the native people of the Pacific Northwest. It has many classic mythological elements such as transformations and journeys, both physical and spiritual. It is also unique among Disney films, in having no villain (at least in a tangible sense). The movie features great music by Phil Collins and beautiful animation. It also makes novel use of the movie screen by switching to a wider aspect ratio at a certain point in the story.The protagonist, the Inuit Kenai, learns the value of his totem, love, when he is transformed into a bear and becomes the traveling companion of the cub, Koda. The film also features the hilarious Canadian moose, Rutt and Tuke (Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas) for comic relief.I would count Brother Bear among my three favorite animated films (along with South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut and Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron). It's also great for the kids. 10/10"
696,tt0328880,8,"Though I think highly of the new three-dimensional computerized animated films, the traditional hand-drawn stuff just has a different charm. And whatever some people say, traditional animation is not dated. This cartoon's story is interesting, accurately based on real Inuit beliefs. Every component of it is great, and the scene where Koda discovers that Kenai is really a man is beautiful. Not going to give away the happenings behind this powerful, moving scene. The hand-drawn animation is done in the classical style, but the computer graphics are breathtaking. The waterfalls, the mountains, the Aurora Borealis... they're fantastic. The two McKenzie moose are great for comic relief. The characterization is  great, and I like the Inuit priest. The brotherhood is something I can identify with perfectly - my three cousins are exactly the same. The music depends on preference. I think the opening Tina Turner song is OK, nothing special, but the Phil Collins songs are better. It's no Jungle Book, Oliver and Company or Lion King when it comes to the music department. I think Jeremy Suarez (seems familiar in the behind-the-scenes trailer) must be a pretty good actor. Koda's my favorite character in the movie. This cartoon is really great, and I'm torn between it and Finding Nemo for cartoon of the year. It's great entertainment, an interesting story told through a truly great, but dying, art form."
697,tt0328880,1,"First, I want to congratulate the creative team that developed and produced Brother Bear, which is truly an audio-visual masterpiece. The use of a classic story formula to tell a deeper more meaningful story within a story is nothing short of amazing. This feature is a perfect storm of artwork, story telling, and music guaranteed to rock your emotional boat.Second, be patient! This feature requires several viewings to understand and to catch the symmetry and depth of the story within the story. Also you must watch the wide screen version, which is the best way to understand this feature's sub-story. The surface story is for the kids, the real story is for adults of all ages, however, I would preview first before showing to the extremely young or insecure as there are some dark themes presented here. So prepare yourself first, as this feature should spark some good family discussions.If you take this feature at face value, you get a classic coming of age story touching on just about every major theme in literature. One can also make a case for when the Inuit's first bonded with the animal world as the alternate story, both of which are well told, however some folks might consider it repetitive or boring. Unfortunately, these folks missed the whole point of the feature.The secret and beauty of this feature is to look beyond the classic Disney story and focus on the sub-text being used and you'll discover a deeper more inspiring story framed within the classic Disney formula. In other words don't take this feature at face value. To understand the sub-story, you need to pay attention to the use of metaphors as well as the clues within the songs. That's right, the songs are strongly tied to the sub-story. To start off with, the title song 'Great Spirits', tells us 'In a world that's not always as it seems'. This is a hint that this story is not what is seems as the Inuit's, Bears, Mammoths, Moose, and Rams are really metaphors for other things. Heck, even Rutt and Tuke's ""I Spy"" game had nothing to do with what they were describing. Uncover the metaphor of the mammoths and you'll discover the real story of Brother Bear. Once you do, you'll find that there is not one wasted scene in this feature. Even the clips in the trailer are connected.So what we have is a story of Kenai's journey of discovery, not only of the world around him but of himself and how he fits into it. By the end of his journey, Kenai understands what his destiny is and embraces it. In doing so, he's knows he can make a difference in this world by being able to help Koda as well as being able to help his people avoid a tragic fate. That's right, the real message of this story has direct application to today's world.Major morals from the story:1) We are all brothers and sisters in this world.2) See and understand the other person's point of view (even if you don't agree with it).3) Tolerance4) Being responsible for your actions.5) Forgiveness and Redemption.6) There is no greater love than the ability to sacrifice oneself for a friend.7) To those ruled by hate and fear: ....a) No matter who you are or how talented you may be, you will not last long in this world. ....b) It's not wise to pick a fight with bears.As far as sequels go, it will be hard to improve on a masterpiece. But if Disney pursues one, they have their work cut out for them, as they need to remain true to the real story of Brother Bear. However, I would strongly make a case for a spin-off for Rutt and Tuke as they have serious franchise potential with their moose appeal (whoops meant mass appeal) and drawing power. You either love them or you love to hate them, eh. That about wraps it up so I think its time for some barley and hops all covered in dew (properly aged of course).My score: ...Surface Story (10/10) ...Real Story (10/10) Wide screen version. ...Rutt/Tuke Commentary (8/10) Trample off! It couldn't have been way better, eh! ...Soundtrack (10/10)"
698,tt0338094,7,"When this movie came out critics and audiences were saying how rubbish it was and it was a waste of time and money, but as i have a keen interest in the paranormal i still wanted to see it anyway and i glad i did! This is a family film but there are elements of adult horror here such as suicides, murder and even zombies! The story is of a typical workaholic dad who neglects his family and decides to take them away to make up for this, but when he receives a call asking him to sell a mansion he can't refuse so off he and his family go.Once there they meet the creepy butler Ramsley and the owner Mr Gracy who are obviously ghosts, and from then on all the supernatural events follow one-another from zombie reflections to levitating around a psychic in a crystal ball called Madame Leota. And i thought she was the best character in the film, not just because i'm a Jennifer Tilly fan but because she is very funny and has a strong personality for just a head.The effects are as amazing as the sets with the green glow of Madame Leota, the zombies and more even the people who didn't like this film can't deny that the effects are excellent. As i said the sets are also some of the best i've seen the mansion is absolutely breathtaking.The only thing that i think is bad with this movie is the child actors, they just look bored going round the mansion with straight faces even though they follow ghostly orbs into unknown places. But apart from this the rest of the film is great fun for kids and for the adults who aren't afraid to turn their brain off for 90mins. WATCH IT!!!!"
699,tt0338094,8,"First of all, I am a Disney kid that grew up going to Disneyland in CA every year. Since I am a fan of the ride, ""The Haunted Mansion"", I guess I expected this film to be good. When I heard the mediocre reviews, I backed off from watching it until I just bought it on DVD this past weekend. I was very surprised to find it a lot better than I expected. My kids loved it and have watched it about 3 times.The sets were beautiful and intricate, the costumes and make-up are gorgeous and the special effects are amazing. Rick Baker ""Monster Maker"" is so talented and has done an impressive (as always) job creating a vision from the Haunted Mansion ride that he also admired.If you are a fan of the ride, I would imagine that you would enjoy this movie as much as me."

This is a good time popcorn movie so don't look for anything deep or scary. Simply putting it, if you like the ride, you'll find something to enjoy in this movie."
701,tt0338094,8,"'The Haunted Mansion' got a lot of bombs thrown at it by critics, and almost nobody liked it. Well, guess what: I did. It's a faithful homage to the ride, the actors are interesting, and the horror side of the story is appropriately creepy. The plot is partially based on the French version of the ride, and it's decent. Although the movie never answers the question of why Master Gracey (Nathaniel Parker, who's really good here) couldn't marry his sweetheart Elizabeth (who was black), the hints are pretty obvious. And I liked the whole concept of the curse (even though it doesn't make any sense). The little nods to the ride throughout the movie are fun, especially Jennifer Tilly as Madame Leota, a disembodied head inside a crystal ball who speaks in riddles. Tilly can do this husky-voiced role in her sleep, and I liked her (the special effects involving her are pretty neat too). Although Eddie Murphy is miscast, and there are zero laughs in the movie, his mugging for the camera doesn't hurt the movie. The kids are OK, and Marsha Thomason does what she can with a thankless role, but it's Terence Stamp who steals the movie. He is Ramsley, the sinister butler of Master Gracey. With his deep rumbling British accent, Stamp gives a deliciously over-the-top performance, and he does here what Johnny Depp did for 'Pirates of the Caribbean'. Back to Eddie Murphy for a minute: Although he earns no laughs, he plays noncomedic scenes well, and he has some good banter with Stamp. The production design of the mansion and the ghostly special effects are very cool, particularly a zombie attack that pushes the PG rating to it's limits. Is 'The Haunted Mansion' a great movie? Absolutely not; they could have punched up the comedy aspect of the movie. It's not a bad movie, though. I thought it was very entertaining, and it's certainly better than the awful trailers. Not as good as 'Pirates', but a fun ride nonetheless."

703,tt0338094,6,"This was a very poorly reviewed film, and it didn't deserve such flack. For me, it was a dumb, entertaining movie with some heart. For others, it was a terrible job of emulating the classic Disney ride and just another stupid Eddie Murphy comedy vehicle. Though I'd rather go on the ride as opposed to watching this, it still has it's charm. This movie is about a Realtor (Murphy) and his family traveling to a haunted mansion for a business deal. While in the house they learn some strange things and end up traveling through various rooms found in the ride (the bride, the ballroom, Madame Leota, the graveyard with the singing busts). In the end, this is a fun movie for kids, and amusing for adults, with fun references, and a fun performance by Murphy and the kids.My rating: ** 1/2 out of ****. 85 mins. PG for mild language, violence"
704,tt0318850,8,"I LOVED this movie. I also as some other people thought it was slow-going and it actually bored me at first, but then at the ending really intense. I also thought it was much too short. I said at the end of the movie ""It's over?, well that's stupid."" They should have made the training part much longer. All they showed was when she was riding him then riding him with a saddle.I also loved the scenery.It was beautiful.I thought there was too many different horses playing the same part. I was reading in a magazine there was like 9 different horses playing it. And not only that you could tell very well that they were different breeds also.But after those mistakes I loved it, it was a touching story."
705,tt0052278,1,"""Teacher's Pet"" is a deliciously funny look at journalism, and the clash between 'formal' education vs. practical experience, with higher learning championed by Doris Day, and the 'School of Hard Knocks' represented by the 'King', himself, Clark Gable. Despite an obvious age difference (Gable, at 57, was showing all of his years), the chemistry between the stars is electric, and with Oscar-nominated Gig Young providing terrific comic support as Gable's brilliant yet down-to-earth competition for Day, the film manages to be both witty and wise.With over a quarter century of playing newspapermen, the role of hard-boiled City Editor Jim Gannon fit Clark Gable like an old shoe. No-nonsense, pragmatic, and a workaholic, Gannon was the classic 'school drop-out' who learned the newspaper business from the ground up, and held college in contempt. While Gannon was obviously a dinosaur, even by 1950s' standards, Gable appears to be having a ball as the cigarette-smoking, plain-spoken, 'blue-collar' hero.Despite the constant ""Will she or Won't she?"" sexual undercurrent of so many of her best comedies of the fifties and early sixties, Doris Day was also a feminist during the era, with her characters self-sufficient, and often holding down important positions based on merit. As Erica Stone, an ex-reporter who returns to college to teach journalism, her demeanor is professional and her knowledge unimpeachable, making her the perfect foil for Gannon.While the descriptions of Gannon and Stone sound like formula characters for Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn (not surprisingly, as the script was penned by longtime friends Fay and Michael Kanin), the Gable/Day teaming provides a sexual tension that, by the late 1950s, would have been far less apparent had Tracy and Hepburn taken the roles. Even at the twilight of his career, Gable was so totally 'male' that he raised the bar of any actress opposite him, with Day's signature 'perkiness' transformed, here, into sexual potential in a tight skirt (watch her tease Gable, swaying her hips to ""The Girl Who Invented Rock and Roll""; Day has never been sexier!) While the resolution is not surprising, some remarkably candid observations of what makes good print journalism are given by both Day and Gable, with Day's comment of television replacing newspapers as the public's source for breaking news remarkably farsighted in 1958! If you want a terrific comedy with two stars at the top of their game, look no further; ""Teacher's Pet"" delivers!"
706,tt0349825,8,"During the 2010 Winter Olympics, NBC broadcast a 30-minute documentary piece on the 1980 US Olympic ice hockey team. While I knew the story of how they beat the Soviets and won the Gold Medal (I had seen it live as a kid), I was expecting some clichéd rhetoric about the team and what they had done, akin to films like ""Knute Rockne, All American"" (1940) and ""Rocky"" (1976). I was pleasantly surprised to find that the story was anything but. The coach of that team, Herbert Brooks, was no hackneyed clone of a Knute Rockne or a Vince Limbardo. Instead he was a tight-fisted uncompromising hockey general who distanced himself from his players, more like a Bobby Knight than a Knute. This was not someone with whom teammates would feel comfortable having a beer. Instead, his inspiration to the players came from the other direction, by exposing their weaknesses and in some cases using unfairness and resentment as anchors from which to get the best out of his players. I decided that ""Miracle"" might be worth a look, especially as a prelude to the US vs Canada in the gold medal round of 2010 Olympic Hockey.Kurt Russell portrays Herbert Brooks as a lean and mean hockey coach who leaves sentimentality at the front door of the ice hockey rink. From the get-go he informs his players he's not there to be their friend. His goal is to let loose their highest playing potential coupled with the best conditioning among the Olympic hockey players at all costs. At times, he seems to be driving the players too hard well-beyond their comfort zones. Much of the story is the unconventional training techniques he uses to prepare the players for the 1980 Winter Olympics. According to the film, Brooks is relatively new to these techniques which he adopted while studying USSR hockey. His plan is to use the Soviets' techniques against them in the Olympics, which is not just about strategy but also about extreme discipline and an uncompromising tough sensibility akin to the military. One character points out that everything Brooks does has a purpose behind it. The only short-coming in the script may be the portrayal of Brooks' wife who finds her relationship with her husband compromised, at least according to the film. I wondered if it played out in real life as in the film or if it was fabricated by the screenwriters. Too many sports movies have this sort of relationship with the wife acting as the balance between the obsessive coach and the needs of his family. She's been through this before. Why did she marry him in the first place? To be a successful account?Certainly, most Americans know the outcome of the story, although the sequence of the game between the US and the Soviets is riveting and plays out about as well as the fight between Rocky and Apollo Creed. However, the meat of the story is really about the relationship between Brooks and his players, and the coach's single-minded determination to create the best Olympic team possible. By putting a certain amount of anger and determination into their hearts and heads, Brooks brings out the best in them, much like a sergeant in boot camp. The speech before the Americans played the Soviets is one of the better scenes of its type, leaving behind the ""do it for the Gipper"" silliness that has become a sports cliché. The only moment which was lacking in the film was the speech before the very final game when the US played Finland after the Soviets. In that speech, apparently Brooks told his team that if they didn't win, they would go to their graves regretting the missed opportunity. I would have liked to have seen Russell give that speech as well. Apparently Herb Brooks died before the principal shooting of this film had ended, and the film is dedicated to him. Just about as fitting a tribute as a coach could ask for."
707,tt0361467,4,"'Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen' comes as a disappointment from Lindsay Lohan after the very funny 'Freaky Friday' and 'Mean Girls'. Here she plays Mary, naming herself Lola, a girl who leaves New York, the city she loves, and moves to New Jersey with her mother and two little sisters. At her new school she becomes friends with Ella (Alison Pill), mainly because they both like the same rock band, Sid Arthur. Lola is a nice person but lies too much because she wants to be liked. She seems very sure of herself, but we understand that is only on the surface. Since the school is where most of the story takes place we need a villain, another good looking girl named Carla (Mega Fox). Parts of the story involve the bad Sid Arthur breaking up, a last concert they will give in New York and Lola and Ella trying to get in. Carla will be there since her father is the lawyer that represents Sid Arthur. Other parts involve a school play where Lola is cast for the leading role and Carla only for a small supporting role.I am not sure why this film was made, but I guess to show Lohan dancing, singing, being arrogant, learning her lesson, have a happy ending, do some more dancing and some more singing. It felt more like a Hilary Duff film and I was not surprised to learn the part of Lola was in fact offered to her first. No offense to Duff, but Lohan is a much better actress and has proved that in films with scripts so much more intelligent than this one. This one fits in a line with Duff films like 'A Cinderella Story' or 'Raise Your Voice', films where you can enjoy the good looking lady but nothing else. I hope Lohan's next film will have the wit of a 'Mean Girls' again. I even have hard time believing young teenage girls will enjoy this one. There are some moments for them to be funny I guess, but most of the time it is not. Not for male adults, not for teenage girls.I like Lindsay Lohan, a lot actually, therefore I was able to finish this film. She does the best she can, basically proving she is too good for material like this. Without her I would have hated this film completely. Since most people will not like Lohan as much as I do I can honestly say you will probably hate this film too."
789,tt0388980,1,"Although I'm not a golf fan, I attended a sneak preview of this movie and absolutely loved it. The historical settings, the blatant class distinctions, and seeing the good and the bad on both sides of the dividing line held my attention throughout. The actors and their characterizations were all mesmerizing. And I was on the edge of my seat during the golf segments, which were not only dramatic and exciting but easy to follow. Toward the end of this movie, ""Seabiscuit"" came strongly to mind, although ""The Greatest Game Ever Played"" is far less complex a story than that film. In both cases, the fact that the events really happened deepened my interest."
790,tt0371606,6,"This was a film with a somewhat interesting premise, a somewhat interesting main character, and a somewhat interesting conclusion. This was not a Pixar film: it wasn't designed to appeal to adults. Rather, the writers focus on giving the kiddies a few laughs without leaving the parents comatose with boredom.And when everything is taken into consideration, the writers succeed. Somewhat.It's just not a very memorable film. Whreas most kids can watch films like ""Shrek"" repeatedly because of the sight gags, talented voice-over performances, and hidden jokes that they might not catch the first time around, ""Chicken Little"" is likely to be forgotten the moment the credits roll. That's not to say that Disney doesn't provide it's standard politically correct message. Of course the best player on the baseball team is a girl (Foxy Loxy). Of course a girl (Goosey Loosey) beats up and humiliates the boy (Chicken Little). Of course the character with the most redeeming social value is physically unattractive (Abby Mallard). And on, and on, and on. Disney also manages to continue its bizarre tradition of creating single father families (""Little Mermaid"", ""Aladdin"", ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""The Goofy Movie""): Chicken Little's mother has, of course, departed for the great unknown.The relationship between Chicken Little and his father comes across as more annoying than heartwarming. The premise: A father realizes that it's probably not such a great idea to be embarrassed by his son; by the end of the movie, what his own child thinks of him actually takes precedent over the opinions of neighbors and perfect strangers! This message would undoubtedly come across as highly inspirational...if not for the fact that it's so blatantly obvious, hackneyed, and overplayed.The voice-over's for the film were largely uninspiring, save for amusing performances by Don Knotts and Adam West. ""Fish out of Water"" was easily the most likable of the bunch (yes, I was suckered by the standard Disney cutesy animated character in their never ending attempt to sell more toys), and he didn't even have a speaking roll. No, ""Chicken Little"" is not the worst animated film I've ever seen...but memorable, it is not."
708,tt0299172,2,"This is the most dispiriting Disney release since the dark days of the Black Cauldron.  The laughs were strained and ill-timed.  While the string of quality Disney movies carefully crafted humor aimed at adults as well as children, this one relied almost exclusively on belch jokes and inappropriate (not to mention inane) sexual innuendo.  Seemingly undecided whether it was to be Emperor's-New-Groove-goes-country or South-Park-in-the-West, it miserably fails its audience both young and old.While Judi Dench and Jennifer Tilly struggle in vain to carry the film with some attention to character, it never ceases to amaze that Roseanne -- purportedly a former stand-up comic -- has such leaden delivery and a complete lack of comic timing.  Obviously, unless she is bellowing at another character, there is simply no way that her talented co-stars can create any rapport.  From her first words on screen, Roseanne sinks this movie like a stone.A total waste of some talented co-stars.Please, please, let this be the final death rattle of the Eisner era.  It is bad enough that Michael Eisner has ruined practically every character through badly-thought-out and badly-realized straight-to-video sequels, but to completely destroy the bedrock of the Disney empire -- animated theatrical releases -- is unforgiveable.This one only gets a 2 out of 10."
709,tt0299172,5,"It has been nearly five years since the release of this recent traditionally animated Disney flick, made in a CGI-dominated time, and I definitely didn't even hear about it at the time of its release. It clearly didn't turn out to be a box office smash, which is probably why I never heard about it (unlike ""The Incredibles"", the hugely successful CGI-animated feature released the same year), and I don't think I knew about it until I saw it mentioned in a book about animated films a couple years ago. After seeing ""Home on the Range"", I can definitely see why it tanked.In the old west, Maggie, Mrs. Calloway, and Grace are three cows, all with very different traits, who live on a dairy farm in Nebraska called Patch of Heaven, owned by an elderly widow named Pearl Gesner. Pearl owes a lot of money, which she unfortunately can't pay, so it appears she will soon lose her farm, and it will be auctioned off! So, the three cows decide to set out to try and save their home. They must track down an outlaw, a cattle rustler named Alameda Slim, who uses a false identity to claim many properties in the state, and hypnotizes cows with his yodeling! On their adventure, they meet others on the same mission, to try and stop Alameda Slim, and due to the different traits of the three cows, they don't always get along, with conflict between Maggie and Mrs. Calloway, which obviously won't make it easier! Others have already mentioned the lacklustre plot of this film, and I'm going to have to agree wholeheartedly. The plot pretty much completely failed to interest me, since it's very simple and forgettable, and the real lack of humour doesn't help. I only rarely found amusing moments, and kept a straight face for almost the entire thing. For example, there's some weak slapstick, which may appeal to kids, but probably not many others. I found that the funniest parts involved Alameda Slim's dimwitted nephews, parts such as them not being able to recognise their uncle after they've seen him put his simple disguise on, but they are very minor characters. Not only is the plot forgettable, so are the gags and most of the characters. Basically, the film was put together fairly simply, and probably could have been more focused. I found myself indifferent to pretty much everything about it, and I'm sure I'm not alone.It looks like this film marked the end of a very long era, the era of traditionally animated theatrical Disney movies, which began in 1937 with ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" and went on with the company long after Walt Disney's death in 1966. Through those decades, so many classics were made in the franchise, so it's unfortunate that they couldn't finish with a much more noteworthy picture. Instead, they finished with a dull one, one which is probably much more appealing to kids than adults, unlike probably most of them, which can be fun for all ages. ""Home on the Range"" reminds me a lot of ""Rock-A-Doodle"", a 1991 animated film from Don Bluth, and not one of his more popular efforts. Both are lacklustre animated films with anthropomorphic animals, ones which are basically for the kids, and I've personally found to be very unmemorable."
710,tt0299172,3,"The 44th animated Disney ""classic"" is just one among other good examples of how Disney went downhill during these last years.It's sad to see how Disney (which made so many timeless classics) declined that much. What happened to the traditional hand-drawn classics? All this CGI stuff only ruined Disney! ""Home On The Range"" isn't the worst Disney movie ever, but it is side by side with their worst movies.This movie has lots of irritating moments, but the worst of all is a scene in a bar - one of the most ridiculous scenes in a movie! The ""humor"" of this movie isn't the classic humor which is really funny. What we see here is nothing but annoying, unconventional and pointless modern humor.This movie has some nice backgrounds of the Old West, but only a few. The characters are very ugly in general and so terribly designed that it's impossible not to feel annoyed by them.Stupid situations, terrible designs, very low picture quality, awful animation and boring songs are more weak points of this disgrace.The characters in general are annoying. The only characters I liked were the little yellow birds, the little pigs and Rusty the Dog. But even these characters can't be compared with the beloved and legendary Disney characters of the great classics from the past."
711,tt0299172,2,"I'm typing this as the movie is playing on DVD. And the kids seem to like watching it. But then, they're young and animation appeals in general. Still, we try to watch with them... and I happen to love animation myself, having some background in cartoon-drawing. Everything Pixar? Fantastic. Old Disney? Sure, serve it up. Along with the Looney Tunes, old Tom & Jerry, etc.This, though, is a sleepwalk of a feature in so many ways. Not in the animation, which isn't bad (though not much special, in context of what's out there). Nor in the music, which is decent enough. The writing, however, is horrible. I can't imagine anyone characterizing this dialogue as ""funny""... it's an endless stream of clichés. And the story line, while thin at the core, is unnecessarily complicated at the fringes. The twists don't feel like twists. They feel like fumbling shortcuts used to navigate a nest of tangled details. I find myself astounded at how (a) such a venerable studio as Disney gets behind this kind of project (b) how they manage to attract so much high-profile voice talent and (c) how those actors stomach saying these lines, given that every one of them has acted in much better stuff than this pap. I guess a paycheck helps.But still, ultimately this is a movie that shouldn't have been made.P.S. One other thing... one can't help but feel like this is one of those animation movies meant to appeal to a demographic. Like, say, the vast swath of middle America that loves country music. It's worth noting that the other failed animated movies of recent years have all attempted to do the same kind of feel-good, blatant targeting. Brother Bear... Fox and the Hound 2... there are others I can't think of at the moment. Why does it fail? First, because the movies by nature end up offering stereotypes of the demographic they're targeting. Second, because they end up being style over substance. The plot is just a vehicle to deliver the caricature. And last, because it's ridiculous to assume that great story lines don't transcend the cultural distinctions. Do the studio marketers really think, for instance, that the Nascar set and Manhattan kids alike can't ""get"" Monsters Inc or Toy Story on a shared level? The only movie of recent years that seemed to beat that rap was ""Cars."" And that was because it was a good story, not stuck in being pedantic or playing to any one crowd."
712,tt0299172,7,"I really took a chance when I bought the DVD of ""Home On The Range"" because I had not seen it. It is not my normal practice to buy something that I am totally unfamiliar with. However, I was happily surprised. This movie was wonderful! My kids and I thoroughly enjoyed it.Roseanne provided a funny voice to one of the cows. Love her or hate her, the casting was perfect, like Ellen DeGeneres was for ""Finding Nemo"".I read here on IMDb that ""Home On The Range"" is the last Disney film to be done with traditional animation. Maybe there are faster or cheaper ways of making these movies, but a great history is coming to an end. Kind of sad I recommend this movie. While it may not be a masterpiece, it is a delight that is better than most Don Bluth or Dreamworks films.I would give it *** out of four. Fun and funny stuff!"
713,tt0299172,1,"Throughout my life I was raised on the beautiful animation from the 'wonderful world of Disney'.  Even as an adult I continued to love the stories and wonderful animation that set Disney apart from the rest.  But the recent years have seen a huge decline not only in the animation department, but in storyline as well.  It now seems, with this movie in particular, to be caught in an avalanche of lousy animation, overused puns and cheap innuendo.  It may amuse a 5 year old, but for anyone that ever appreciated the quality that was once a Disney trademark will be sorely disappointed!  I had hopes with the beauty and quality of movies such as 'The Little Mermaid', 'Beauty and the Beast' and 'Aladdin', but those apparently were the last gasps of any beauty in artistic and story quality! This one must surely have sent Walt Disney spinning in his grave to see how the current regime has cheapened everything he worked so hard to build! The likes of 'Snow White', 'Pinnochio, 'Bambi' and those like it are apparently gone for good!  How sad to see such a grand art form bite the dust!  Shame on the animators of this one!"
714,tt0299172,1,"The critics were right about this movie that it wasn't worth the time or movie to see it. This movie might have been one of the reason to shut down this ink animation dept. What was the purpose of this movie? Was it based on cows or Rosanne Barr? They should have featured her in a live action movie. There was not much of a story and it didn't make sense. A yodeling outlaw riding a bison stealing cattle right from under ranchers who don't have enough sense to take care of them. There is not one cow hand, cowboy, or cow dog in sight. Thank goodness, there are no predators either. Maybe this is a reason why the cows follow this outlaw like sheep, they never heard howling before nor are they ever sang to like one of the cows was by the old lady of pleasant valley."
715,tt0353965,7,"Films that show people who are able to live simpler lives in unusual situations always fascinate me. This was a film that captivated me through every frame. It is filmed with such beauty that the images are quite striking.I especially enjoyed how it demonstrates a difference between these rural situations with big city life. Cities are shown with high-speed imagery; cars fly by with incredible ferocity. This is then followed by transitions of killer whales surfacing, schools of fish swirling around, and monkeys jumping from tree to tree.Native people are seen in canoes, or are hiking carrying long spears for the hunt. This film did not leave me with a sudden urge to live their kind of lives; however, I enjoyed what I saw.It does not portray people as necessarily evil or bad for the earth as much as it demonstrates our need to care for what we have. This is the only Earth we know of. Let's take care of it."

And with the narration, which is done by Academy Award winner Robert Redford, you will be heart felt by the end credits. Disney Pictures has come up with a new way to present new Documentaries, much like they had done back in the 1950's. Recently, they have done more documentaries, such as Ghosts of the Abyss and Aliens of the Deep. Most of them have gained much critical acclaim, and met with great response from viewers alike. And at 40 minutes, this Picturesque documentary feature will capture you forever, and deserves the 10 of 10 rating."

Apparently there are some natives, somewhere in the wild world, they have lived by these ideals since time immemorial, but now they face extinction. They want their voices heard and it's time for us to listen! Sadly we don't hear their voices; their voices are dubbed in English, and to give the native flavor, they have been dubbed in native-sounding 'bad' English! The movie speaks about how all life is one spirit, and how it is proper to see the earth as a mother, yet it presents these ideas so conceptually, with makeup but without feeling; we are almost forced to agree with it, because it sounds so logical and there are so many beautiful hypnotizing scenes. The movie has no philosophy. It doesn't touch the ground, it doesn't say anything. There's nothing that 'evolves' or 'developes' in it. Some people may find it relaxing to watch the beautiful landscapes, but after you relax, the constant commercial sounding assertion that all life is divine, sensing the hidden manipulation that we should all become new-agers and live like tribal men gets boring fast. Everything is covered in a wave of nostalgia. It makes you feel stupid. The spiritual depth of the concepts are taken very lightly. I would wish this God, whatever it is, would stay inside the movie and rule there whatever it wants. I want my movie to stay in the movie. Don't stretch out of your boundaries and teach me reality!"
720,tt0327437,8,"Around the World in 80 Days (2004), starring Jackie Chan, currently has an IMDb user rating of 5.7. And they say it's one of the biggest flops in history, having failed to recoup more than a fraction of its (estimated) $110 million budget.I say, give it time! Overseas box office plus rentals and DVD sales - this movie will turn a profit in the end. As I understand it, movie companies now make most of their money off the rental market, so I am rather mystified to hear that a movie flopped just because it didn't earn back its cost at the U.S. box office in the first couple of months of release. Doesn't seem like a fair and complete calculation to me.Anyway, I go to the trouble of wondering about this because I thought this was a great and delightful romp of a comedy, and I believe posterity will be much kinder to it than ""5.7"". The movie is witty, beautiful, well-acted and contains virtually everything any kung fu adventure fan's heart can desire. Before watching it, I thought it would be more faithful to the original book, so I was surprised to see the Ten Tigers of Kwantung, and let me say the surprise was 100% positive. This movie is, absolutely first and foremost, a comedy. And it is something so rare as a literate one, which does not ridicule the premise it is based on. The movie makes the only right choice, namely to update the classic story and add new levels and new ideas, which keeps it fresh and adventurous. Let's face it, Jules Verne's science no longer holds up in the present day, so we have to make modified versions of the stories for a modern audience (hence also the very entertaining updated version of Journey to the Center of the Earth: The Core).To see this movie as a remake of the 1956 movie - which seems to be the position that many reviewers take - is completely faulty. This is a riff/homage to the original novel, having nothing whatsoever to do with any previous movie version.I thought Jackie Chan's part in this movie was great fun, and I was very entertained throughout. I can't think why it bombed in the U.S. I'm gonna get it on DVD very soon."
721,tt0327437,6,"Jackie Chan has had a mixed time of late in Hollywood. There was the good fun of Shanghai Knights and around that was the poor duo of Tuxedo and The Medallion. This falls somewhere in the middle. Around The World is good fun. It's not great but it has charm and energy and is the sort of mindless, competent movie making that is hard not to enjoy watching. It's forgettable, could have been much better, but all in all not a bad way to spend a Saturday afternoon.The look of the film feels very Disney. It is all very much orientated towards satisfying children. It's almost a cartoonish realism with the set design and costumes, clearly evident with Philleas Fogs gadget laden home. The action in the film and the looks could probably have been more gritty but in any case it looks very colourful and the various settings all catch the eye. It is clearly evident that the film had a lot spent on it, although some of the CGI effects are not of the standard expected from a $110 million film.Cast-wise, Jackie Chan as ever is good. He's a comical genius and as usual performs his own stunts. The fight scenes are good. Nothing compared to Chan's Hong Kong stuff but far superior to much of his Hollywood action. Steve Coogan is someone I am a big fan of. He is the dog's hairy things as Alan Partridge. He is a comical genius. He doesn't seem as entirely natural here though and the character he creates doesn't always work. It seems too cartoony at times especially the accent. Cecile De France is very good as Coogan's love interest. She is attractive, in a cutesy sort of way but she has a charm and a likeability that works very well and the three leads seem to have a good chemistry. The rest of the cast are all excellent with a huge list of supporting parts and cameo's including an excellent Jim Broadbent, a great part for Ah-nuld Schwarzenegger, and it was great to see him on screen with Chan, also Rob Schneider, Luke and Owen Wilson, John Cleese, Kathy Bates, and particularly exciting to me as a Hong Kong action fan, Sammo Hung. The best supporting part for me was Ewan Bremner as the accident prone police sergeant.Overall it's worth watching and is entertaining enough but don't expect it to blow your socks off. ***"
722,tt0327437,6,"The credits roll, and I sarcastically turn to my friend, and whisper, ""Dude, 3 screenwriters, and they're all named Dave.""Oddly enough, that turned out to pretty much sum up the whole movie.It's not BAD.  It leans toward good, except it's not so much a remake as it is a Disney-fication.  Like 'Cinderella' and 'The Little Mermaid' before it, Disney takes the title of the story and a few major characters, and just turns it into a theme-park attraction with emotional and dramatic resonance to match.Frank Coraci is solely responsible for making Adam Sandler's star stick. ""Happy Gilmore"" was cute, but it didn't have the style of a REAL movie, like his two films with Coraci, ""The Wedding Singer,"" and ""The Waterboy.""  Those films work as FILMS, not just Adam Sandler vehicles.I had high hopes for this one, and for that reason, it splatted.  Amusing lines here and there, and great kung-fu choreography ruined by the same poor photography that screwed up ""Rush Hour.""  This is martial arts.  DO NOT shoot your actors from the waist up.  Things happen too fast, people are moving in too many directions.  So in ""80 Days,"" like in ""Rush Hour,"" I had a sense that there was martial arts taking place, but could barely see it. Coraci does pull the camera back a few times, down to the ankles maybe, so a few scenes are reasonably well-shot.  But not as well as they could have been.  In fact, the entire movie feels rushed, like they're trying to cram the whole script into the alotted time frame.  Some ""Indiana Jones""-type pacing would have worked wonders, even if it made the movie 30 minutes longer.  We're still talking about the book 100 years later for a reason, you know.What could have been fun for everyone turns into Disney-video wackiness that will barely appeal to anyone over 13, and not at all to any fan of Jules Verne.  And thus the old rule applies once again.... the more screenwriters, the worse the film.  Even if they're all named Dave."
723,tt0327437,8,"""Around the World in 80 Days"" is not luckily Jackie's worst film, that is still ""Tuxedo"".What makes 80 Days such a taunting movie is its unevenness. The film switches between light-hearted to serious and even between various styles of comedy, from Jackie's classic slapstick, to witty, to vain, to gross-out and even Python-style comedy.As far as fight-scenes go, they are well choreographed and Jackie can luckily still kick ass. There were some parts of the film that didn't make a whole lot of sense and because of the massiveness of the plot it feels rather long. Luckily the changes in style keep the viewer on their toes but the climax was not very satisfying however.All in all, Around the World in 80 Days is an amusing film to watch. It has both great and not-so-great moments and may be a little too unconventional for Jackie's fans, but a good movie none the less."
724,tt0327437,8,"There are classic films and fun films and even, very rarely, fun films that become classics.  That's certainly true of Mike Todd's 1956 ""Around the World in 80 Days"" which captured much of the fantastical verve of Jules Verne's original story.  That movie also introduced, basically for the first time, the idea of an onslaught of cameo appearances by famous screen stars, not always readily identifiable.So now as we start to bake at the beginning of a long, languid summer, new director Frank Coraci gives us the irrepressible but getting a bit long-in-the-tooth master acrobat/gymnast/kung-fu artist/stunt man Jackie Chan in a very loose adaptation of the Verne novel.Chan is Passepartout, valet to the inimitably neurotic inventor, Phineas Fogg (Steve Coogan), but in this film his real identity is that of a Chinese fellow, Lau Xing, whose mission is to return a stolen Buddha statue to his village.  Nefarious English lords have an imperialistic and self-aggrandizing plan of their own which includes tearing down the Great Wall of China to get easy access to jade mines.  Jim Broadbent is superbly Victorian-evil as Lord Kelvin, the head of the Royal Society of Science who challenges inventor Fogg to succeed in traversing the Earth in 80 days or else cease and desist forever from engaging in scientific experimentation and Rube Goldberg-like inventing.Passepartout, who swiped the Buddha, has both cops and Chinese killers, led by a woman, General Fang, in hot pursuit and his service to Fogg is a guise to get back to China.Arriving in Paris, they are joined by the beautiful semi-Impressionist painter, Monique La Roche played by the rising young French actress, Cecile De France.  Winsome and cute, De France clearly had a great time making this flick.Coogan plays Fogg very well-in fact he's the most interesting actor in the movie.  He took his role of a Henry Higgins-type scholarly recluse who slowly falls in love seriously.The story proceeds predictably.  While Chan is the star, his performance is simply a well-choreographed reprise of past made-in-the West films where he can show off his skills.  It's ""Shanghai Night"" all over again. Perhaps this is his last such movie as his announcement earlier this week that he intends to be a ""serious"" actor from now on pushed Iraq, gasoline prices and the Bush-Kerry campaign off the front pages.As with the original movie, cameo appearances are a small but welcome treat. The guy who beat Mary Carey for governor of a western state last year is really devilishly funny as an Istanbul prince with a harem and an eye for acquiring Monique.  The Wilson brothers play two young and later to be famous siblings whose great stunt at Kitty Hawk supposedly changed the world.  And Cathy Bates seems to have had a tough time not laughing as she acted the part of the hardly imperious Widow of Windsor.The set designs, cinematography and special effects are really excellent.  I can see several Oscar nominations forthcoming.Don't take this movie seriously-it won't dislodge the original from the pantheon of lastingly memorable films.  Enjoy it as the summer fun vehicle it's meant to be.  Or in any event is.8/10"
725,tt0327437,9,"Is this a Coogan or Chan movie? That's the only puzzling thing about this movie. For the rest simply an action packed adventure, with a little too much romance on the side. 15 years ago this movie would have been a great success in the line of Goonies or a Disney flick.Now a little overacting at times (the English cop who follows the main characters for example) is compensated with great cameos, I won't give them away, but keep watching!Coogan is just like in his tv series, the well-known expressions and faces are shown. Just his character, can anyone be that naive at times???Chan is sometimes the comedian with oneliners, and sometimes the actor with bad lines. His fights rule, his acting still didn't. It didn't spoil the movie, but the plot that kept returning to the 'chinese connection' almost did. I didn't expect a co-plot, just Fogg travelling around the world!!!Don't believe the viewers describing this as a kid-movie. If you liked Goonies in the past, read the book and like Chan's unbelievable fighting scenes, you will be satisfied. 6/10 from me."
726,tt0327437,1,"This film is an extremely fun take on Jules Verne's novel. The storyline and characters are radically different than the originals, but there is a purpose to every detail in this movie. Phileas Fogg is a representation of Jules Verne himself, someone who sees the future. Steve Coogan performed marvelously in displaying the vulnerability of a man who wagers everything. He makes the character lovable and amusing. Jackie Chan brings to the table his classic fight choreography and humor, as well as branching into types of comedy he had not worked with before. Cécile De France is the most charming face in the film and brings an amazing spirit to her role. Jim Broadbent and Ewen Bremner provide some of the greatest laughs. Also notable is the choreography of color for each country. England is gray and dreary, lacking color. France is full of light pastels. Turkey brings in strong colors of gold, blue, and bright white. India is full of deep brown, orange, and green. China provides a lush, natural green background and warm, welcoming earth tones and dark blues. Everything is designed to take audiences on a journey around the world. The end result is a beautiful film that is suitable for all ages and provides that wonderful feel-good sensation that only the greatest adventures can provide."
791,tt0371606,1,"Why does Chicken Little have the voice of a NY accountant. Nemo sounded like a little boy, Chicken Little sounds like a twenty-something Woody Allen. Just awful casting! No magic or script in this film. Horrible. The plot seemed rushed through. The voices were annoying, not endearing. The surrounding cast of characters, especially the pig and the fish were annoying and not cute, nor funny. The gags and jokes were just stupid. The computer animation was bottom rate. Disney should be appalled and Pixar should be feeling indestructible after this flop.The songs were cheesy and ill-timed, they felt forced in to the film. I can't believe they had a training montage set to music. I know it's a kid's film, but come on, the montage is dead. The soundtrack was just plain bad. My kids hate it, and I stand by my kids."
727,tt0327437,7,"Very unfaithful adaptation of the Jules Verne novel, yet much more entertaining than the tedious and wildly overrated but relatively faithful David Niven version. The movie is breezy and enjoyable, with some fun fight scenes, although it is completely inconsequential.I think it would help when watching this movie to have not read the book, because one cannot help but think that the extensive rewriting was not necessary. Passepartout's character could have been expanded for Jackie without so many other changes. Changing Phineas to a bumbling, goofy inventor was clearly done in an attempt to make the movie into another version of the buddy movie that has been Jackie's greatest friend in the U.S., but Coogan is unexceptional in the role and doesn't have a lot of chemistry with Jackie, so they really should have just done the character as written, which could have made for a much smarter movie.In spite of plot holes and some silliness though, I enjoyed this, at least in that, watch-a-movie-on-TV-on-a-Saturday-morning way."
728,tt0327437,9,"Jackie Chans latest movie has just hit our DVD stores shelves (well in Australia at least) and I thought it was about time I submitted my review. The story is very loosely based on Jules Verne's novel of the same name, it involves an eccentric inventor Phileas Fogg trying to race around the world and end up back in England within 80 days while the evil Lord Kelvin tries to make sure he does not win and become the head of the royal academy of science. Before you watch this movie there are a few things you should know, its made by Disney, so its going to be a movie that is aimed at all ages and very family friendly and it also got a PG rating so its a relatively pleasant movie.Having always been a Jackie Chan fan I may be a little bias but I found this movie great fun, much more than I was expecting. All the backdrops are gorgeous, and everything has a fun feel about it, this is the kind of movie that is just purely for entertainment, very light very easy but all together a fun ride that you should want to see again. A lot of cameo appearances are in this movie and ad a whole lot to the feel of the movie and all the main actors play their parts very well. The DVD extras are not much and what should have been a highlight, the deleted scenes where ruined by the director talking over then and making then a waste of time.I can not mention this enough- this movie is very lite, do not see this expecting a life changing experience and just let yourself be taken on the ride. This movie deserves 8.6 out of 10 Now that is cheap to hire do yourself a favor and take a look, you know you want to."

730,tt0368933,6,"How refreshing to attend a non-animated, G-rated movie and enjoy it!  As a 41-year-old woman attending with an 82-year-old friend, I expected a light, pretty, romantic fairy tale, and that's exactly what I got.  Never saw the first movie, but the ""catch-up"" work at the beginning made that a non-issue.Surely, no one would go to this movie expecting to find the meaning of life portrayed on the screen.  Come on, folks, this is a Disney princess flick with Julie Andrews and a G-rating; is anybody expecting deep philosophy?Chick flick?  Of course!  Especially appealing to young (under 18) chicks? Definitely!  Enjoyable to other adult women and men who just want a happy trip to fantasy land with no worries about sex, blood, or blue language? Absolutely!Take this film at face value and you'll enjoy it.  If you can't do that, don't bother seeing it.  There are plenty of other ""profound"" movies out there to inspire, teach, or depress you!  Go for a good time and you'll have it."
731,tt0368933,7,"I remember seeing the first movie not expecting much from it, but when I walked out I was pleasantly surprised! When I saw the previews to this movie I thought ""Oh god! Another movie ruined by a sequel!"" I was slightly wrong in my thinking, because this was in fact a cute, light-hearted, feel-good movie. Maybe it's not as good as the first, but I still thought it was rather enjoyable. Anne Hathaway is a great actress and I'm so glad her talent was discovered and recognized. Julie Andrews gave a great performance as the former Queen of Genovia. This movie may have been predictable and a big ball of fluff, but what do you expect to a sequel to a Disney movie where Pixar wasn't involved? I would recommend this movie to anyone, just as long as you go into it knowing it's different from the first. I'm just praying there won't be a third movie."
732,tt0368933,6,"What does it mean to be a princess? Besides wearing tiaras and twin sets, dancing at ballsattracting fame and fortune simply for being beautiful? A princess is stuck forever in extended adolescence  she only has the trappings of power. Symbolically, at least, a queen has real power, and does not necessarily need to be beautiful. For hundreds of years, fairy tales have filtered through our consciousness to involuntarily fuel our dreams. In the last century, what began as cautionary tales to lecture children have been sugar-spun into a Disneyfied notion of desire. But with Disney's latest, Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement, the recent trend of recasting fairy tales to reflect modern ideals continues, albeit with a gentler hand than yesteryear's feminists. Simply, it's not enough to be a princess anymore. Although ostensibly a conventional tween romantic comedy, Princess Diaries 2 features a heroine who is more independent than Drew Barrymore's character in Ever After (1998) and less frustrated than Julia Stiles' Mary Donaldson clone in the The Prince and Me (2004). And, even better, in Princess Diaries 2, there are no handsome princes, just boys on the side.I'm not a fan of much of director Gary Marshall's work  although Pretty Woman's a classic, Runaway Bride, Raising Helen and the original Princess Diaries are very ordinary films. But in this enchanting sequel, he and screenwriter Shonda Rhimes give us a character who's not just beautiful, klutzy and funny. Mia Mignonette Thermopoulos Rinaldi is growing into her power.Princess Diaries 2 begins five years after the original at Mia's 21st birthday party. After the schemings of John Rhys Davies triggers an ancient Genovian law, Mia has one month to marry, otherwise she will forfeit the throne. As two very different suitors court her, Mia relies on her now affectionate relationship with her grandmother, Queen Clarisse (Julie Andrews), to guide her. Meanwhile security chief Joe (Hector Elizondo) woos the Queen.There are hackneyed moments, the worst of which is a pajama party featuring dozens of little princesses who are designed to reflect their aspirant audience. Although enjoyable, this scene serves no dramatic function, except perhaps to showcase Julie Andrew's expertise in mattress surfing. The change in Queen Clarisse's character is also unexplained  she's transformed from being an acerbic biddy in the first film to being the dream grandmother. However, this film is entertaining, humorous and has a positive message. The cast and characters are also strong, particularly Anne Hathaway as Mia, and there's plenty of chemistry between her and Nicholas (Chris Pine). Heather Matarazzo and Fat Louie the cat also make brief appearances.Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement improves on the original, and will be a particular hit with its target audience: tween and teen girls. But this film's got enough substance to appeal to an older audienceif you let it. ***/***** stars."
733,tt0368933,9,"Anyone who liked the first Princess Diaries movie will like this. It's sweet, it's funny, and there are gorgeous men and gorgeous clothes. My best friend and I are in our late 20's and although it was predictable as any chick flick is...it was well worth our 9 dollar admissions. We loved it, and left feeling happy. Mia arrives back in Genovia only to discover that due to a old law still on the books, she has to marry in order to rule her country. Unfortunately there is another candidate. Mia proceeds to deal with her life with her usual mix of clumsiness and sarcasm, with best friend Lily along for the ride. Memorable scenes include the ball, the parade, the wooden leg, and the continuing romance between Joe and Queen Clarice."
792,tt0371606,4,"There have been many, many movies that Disney has put out that I've had a high desire to see ""succeed"". All in all, most Disney animated movies that have made it to the big screen in the more modern cinema history of, say, from ""Beauty and the Beast"" all the way up to ""Lilo & Stitch"" and ""Brother Bear"", have done that. Perhaps some are only a financial success, like ""Treasure Planet"", but certainly they were popular enough with one group of moviegoers or another to have a good box office take.Unfortunately, ""Chicken Little"" is not a success.In pooling my thoughts to review this movie, I am so highly disappointed that good animation is its only high mark. In this pivotal point in the history of The Walt Disney Company, where its relationship with Pixar is still on the rocks while a new president is stepping up, I wanted this movie to be a smashing success. I wanted this to be the movie that starts another Golden Age revolution, where it is possible that Disney takes the top spot in producing awesome animated movies.I fear that there aren't many good storytellers left at Disney Feature Animation, and there didn't seem to by any present for the making of ""Chicken Little"". The story itself, chronicling the tales of the title character proving to his community that he is not a failure, was a good enough premise. Though it wasn't executed well at all. Instead of solid, premise-building scenes where it's main characters interact well with others (and get the audience laughing along the way), we get a sappy, melodramatic mini-soap with voice actors who don't have a good script...followed immediately by, more times than I'd care to recall, potty humor gags. Judging by the audience of my screening, made up of at least 40% little kids, only they found that funny.With so many 3D animated movies coming out recently, like ""Madagascar"", ""Robots"" and ""Valiant"", all released this year, many companies are trying to prove their movie-making chops to us movie-goers. They can make a very beautiful looking movie, with wonderfully rendered characters that can move so fluidly and realistic...but the very vital element of sharing a good story is missing in action. It's my belief that a great story without great animation will be a much better movie than one that looks great, but has a weak story. Though, both elements are what made Pixar's ""The Incredibles"" an Oscar-contending, $265 million hit. Computer animation is, indeed, not the shoe-in, cure-all solution to a great movie.To boot, ""Chicken Little"" has a weak soundtrack, composed mainly of songs that were popular at one time or another...to the pre-teen-aged crowd. Instead of beautiful, original, fully-composed songs like ""A Whole New World"" in ""Aladdin"" (or anything close to it), we are treated to Spice Girls' ""If You Wanna Be My Lover"" (complete, by the way, with karaoke subtitles). Unoriginal and highly annoying.Having sufficiently railed on the movie, it is my belief that the corporate suits in charge of financing Feature Animation have more blame for the steady decline in their movies than anybody working under them. It seems they think they know what makes a successful movie, over-riding many decisions of the animators and storytellers--those who are still at Feature Animation--who have proved they can make great movies. I believe said pencil pushers are what made last year's ""Home on the Range"" fail, critically and financially.All in all, I believe ""Chicken Little"" is a failure that I define as hot having a good story to match its sweet computer animation. In Disney's quest to prove that they are still the Best of the Best, movies like this will prove to the world that they are merely the best of the rest. And we all know that it's not the Disney we grew up on and cherished.""Chicken Little"" gets 4 of 10 stars"
735,tt0317705,9,"Shortly after Dreamworks screwed up with the uninspired ""Shark Tale"", Pixar contains its remarkably success story with ""The Incredibles"". And while I have to say that I liked ""Finding Nemo"" a bit better, ""The Incredibles"" is still an amazing movie.First of all, this is because it's funny. It's not so funny that you're constantly laughing out loud, but there are more than enough good jokes in the movie to keep you entertained, and it's full of good observations about superhero movies (note all the ridiculous superhero and villain names) and references to other movies. It's also a brilliant James Bond spoof/homage, containing all the gadgets, secret island bases and crazy schemes that made early Bond movies so much fun.Secondly, this movie has heart and charm in droves. It's full of memorably and likable characters you can really identify with and care about. Characters like Edna are instant classics. The voice acting is universally excellent, but Holly Hunter steals the show as Elastigirl. This is a movie that doesn't need toilet humor, characters modeled like celebrities, or a ""hip"" soundtrack...it easily succeeds on charm and style alone.Also, I found it to be a surprisingly good action movie. The plentiful action sequences are full of energy, extremely fast-paced, and exciting, and put many a live-action movie to shame.Finally, I also liked the tone and message of the movie. ""The Incredibles"" basically makes a plea against mediocrity, breaking with the politically correct idea that ""everybody is special"" (and thus nobody really is), and encouraging people to use the talents they have been given. I think this couldn't be more true. Not all people are equally talented (just compare Pixar to Dreamworks), but this is no reason to keep the talented people from not reaching their full potential just because it makes the less talented ones feel bad.""The Incredibles"", while maybe not as hilarious as I had hoped (though it's still very funny), is nonetheless an extremely entertaining movie, that manages to charm you wit its combination of great characters, lots of style, tongue-in-cheek attitude and good message. Highly recommended.****1/2 of ***** stars"
736,tt0317705,1,"WOW! What a movie. I can honestly say this is in my top ten movies of all time, how do Pixar continue to out do themselves at every movie release?The Incredibles is a fantastic story, wonderfully scripted and with the most stunning animation you have ever seen, it provides a perfectly rounded story with plenty of action, laughs and (almost) tears.Basically, this is a story of a man encountering a mid life crisis and leaping headlong into it without a care or a thought for his family, proving exceedingly selfish and failing to see the good in his life. Meanwhile the wife is left to try and look after the family. Really, that's the story. Now, what Pixar have done is drop in the idea that the parents are Superheroes, banned from being Super many years previously by the Government and the people, trying to live a normal life. Add to the mix that some of their children have inherited their own powers and that the Super villains are planning a comeback, and you have this wonderful movie.I can't begin to convey how wonderful the animation is, it's perfect. I mean you'll always be looking at it knowing it's animation, but when the story takes you along you'll suddenly realize you're still watching animation. The subtle difference is that you forget, and there are parts (for instance when the father is cheering his son during the race) that you actually think it is real. The effects for water, fire (two of the hardest things to recreate in animation) and lava are wonderful to watch and caught me drawing a breath when I first saw them.The characters and acting are wonderful, and you will find yourself caring about them as real people. At some points I could feel a big swallow coming up and a wavering adams apple, obviously due to the food earlier, nothing to do with the movie.I often find that movies aren't paced well, that they either have too long or too short an introduction to the characters, or the events that lead up to the pivotal point of the movie are unbalanced against the climax, all sorts of combinations. Not here, this move is perfect and well balanced, the story takes you along just when you are ready, and there were no points where I wished we could move on, or something could happen quicker. My only frustration were at the kids, and this was only because they were behaving exactly as real kids would.It was interesting to see the comparisons and links to other famous Superheroes through comic-lore. Definitely with nods to The Fantastic Four, Silver Surfer and huge nods to The Watchmen. My only concern is that there is so much similarity to The Watchmen that those who haven't read the graphic novel will be saying ""That's the Incredibles movie"" when Watchmen finally comes to fruition.The short film showing before this was wonderful in itself, and had the audience laughing out loud loads. Excellent, and once again, outdoes every short that they've produced before. Boundin' was beautifully animated and wonderfully told. Guaranteed to bring a huge big smile to your face.All in all I think this movie is perfect and truly incredible."
737,tt0317705,1,"Writer-director Brad Bird here has something that I was caught off-guard by just a bit. I always expect Pixar films to be above-par, family entertainment, the kinds of films that can have an appeal to adults on a satirical, jab-in-the-side effect by having the characters reacting to each other as they would on a film with a higher rating, whilst giving the bright colors, action, and silliness that appeals to kids. Watching The Incredibles, their sixth feature-length offering, I wasn't so entertained and amused since their 98 film A Bug's Life, and it almost brought me back to the emotional impact I felt when in the theater for the first time getting Toy Story into my system. It's a film that takes on a type in society that we all know well (in the past they've done toys, bugs, monsters, undersea life, and now comic book archetypes) and transforms it superbly to the imaginative computer-animated landscape. This is also in credit due to Brad Bird, who proved five years ago with his sleeper The Iron Giant that he could transcend the genre and appeal with heart and vigor for almost every age bracket.So what little touches make The Incredibles so appealing? How it starts to deconstruct the idea of a superhero, perhaps, as well as how the family unit is shown in the usual conventions under unusual and funny circumstances. As an example, one of our heroes Mr. Incredible, a.k.a. Bob Parr (voiced wonderfully by Craig T. Nelson), goes to visit a woman who fixes and creates the uniforms of superheroes. In one scene she explains why a cape is not a good idea. This is the kind of scene that might not make it into most Hollywood movies, and would sometimes if not often be discredited as being too 'smart' for kids to get. But by appealing to a kind of level late teens and adults can relate to, it reaches a higher, far more intelligent plane. In fact, many of the best scenes in the film take on what we all know in films displaying the 'family unit' and morph it with the power and imagination of superheroes.I won't go too much into the plot as some may already have, except to say that what makes the story in and of itself appealing is how it is a fully formed story, and doesn't try and sell itself short like other animated films (i.e. Sharktale for example). It also uses it's PG-rating perimeter wisely, and Bird and company create action sequences that are as exciting, if not more so, than in the action films that have been released this year (in fact, some of the scenes in the climax, for my money, could rival a couple of those in Spider-Man 2). By setting up the right emotional bases with the characters- Bob, his wife Elasti-girl (Holly Hunter), their kids, and with supporting characters voiced finitely by the likes of Samuel L. Jackson and Jason Lee, by the time the high-charged, internally fantasy scenes take off, they take off with great conviction and excitement.Overall, The Incredibles is a film that is, in a way, what audiences wish they could get and rarely do- it's a film with wit and observance, a kind of video-game where the results are not as expectable as can be. Some kids may not get it as much as adults might, which is just as well, as it sometimes operates on a level like Antz did, only through the sphere of Disney. In other words, if you say the teaser trailer, which involved the out-of-shape Mr. Incredible trying with all his might to buckle his tights, you'll know what the film could bring. Personally, I can't wait to see it again."
738,tt0317705,1,"I hope that this movie does really well because this has to be one of the best animated movies I have ever seen. The story is really cool and it's obvious that there is a lot of respect here for the source of superheroes, whether it be comic books, serial flicks or Saturday morning cartoons.The movie has an undeniably cool retro feel to it and it shows not only in the design of the picture but also in the music, which definitely sounds like something out of a 60's 007 flick. It is also unusually dark, especially for a Pixar flick. I'm not saying it's dark where people are getting their heads delivered to someone in a box or family members are sleeping with each other or anything like that but there were moments where I found myself wondering if a little kid might be able to deal with the intensity of what was going on on screen. Maybe it was the fact that the heroes were in very real danger most of the time. The bad guys weren't out to catch them as much as they were out to kill them. When you discover who the film's villain is, you can literally feel his anger coming off the screen. I may be over-exaggerating a bit but then again, it really is to the film's credit that it deals with human emotions in the way that it does.Even though you are watching a film that is populated by CGI characters, the emotions they convey in what they say and do come across as purely believable. Whether watching Bob Parr interact with people at his job or just sitting at his desk was something that rang true to me, just in the feeling of it. Everything about this movie has a very concrete feel to it, even while looking like something you'd see in a comic book. The computer graphics in general were absolutely amazing and the voice acting is excellent across the board, so good in fact, that I really can't pick a favorite from the entire cast. I have to say that Craig T. Nelson and Holly Hunter were very good as Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl respectively. They had a moment near the end of the film that actually touched me but you can see that for yourselves. Samuel L. Jackson was hilarious and thankfully, he wasn't overused. Dash and Violet were realized so well that every time they came up on screen, I loved every minute of it. Dash, in particular was one of the funniest characters in the movie. Jason Lee made for a formidable villain as Syndrome. I loved the fact that he was your typical antagonist but was also aware of the conventions surrounding such a role, like when he chides himself for 'monologuing'. He was also one ruthless bastard, I'll give him that. Even the bit part characters were hilarious. There was a kid on a tricycle in this movie who comes out twice and made me laugh out loud both times. In fact, this movie reminds me of why I like Finding Nemo over Monsters, Inc. In Finding Nemo, not only are the main characters great but every other character they run into makes some kind of impression on you. Remember all the characters that Marlin and Dory ran into on their adventures together? Of course you do. Whether it was that crazy pelican with the Australian accent, Willem Dafoe as Gill, leader of the fishtank crew, or Bruce the Shark, you remember them after all is said and done and it makes the viewing experience that much richer. That's exactly how The Incredibles is. Every character that appears will make you laugh or intrigue you in some way. I have to admit that I was laughing myself throughout the entire movie, especially with the character of Edna Mode who almost steals the movie. Man, even the end credits are awesome! I have to give the director Brad Bird a big thumbs up for this one. He pulled it off and hopefully this will attract attention to his other animated film, ""The Iron Giant"", which was sadly overlooked when it was released and is also a really great film.All in all, I can't recommend this movie enough. I left very satisfied and felt no need to compare this to the rest of Pixar's movies. This one is just as good if not better than any other animated movie released this year and rightfully deserves its place among the best animated movies of all time.RATING: ***** out of *****."
739,tt0317705,9,"The Incredibles is a great film, and probably my favourite Pixar picture (Toy Story is the best, but that's different to favourite). It takes a while to properly get into the action, but when it does, it delivers it in spades.And that's exactly it. I would actually call The Incredibles an animated action film, because to be honest, I don't think there was enough comedy to call it an animated action comedy film. There are quite a few funny moments, but the gags don't come as fast as Finding Nemo or Toy Story.That being said, it does have truly amazing action set-pieces, brilliant voice acting, a fabulous script, wonderful characters and the animation is simply.....well....incredible.The music is definitely a stand-out. It actually made me smile, with it's jazzy tones and James Bond type scores.One of the greatest things about The Incredibles is that it's not a kiddies film; it's completely different to all the other Pixar films. They bring out tommy guns in the second scene, for crying out loud! If you want to see a more adult animated film, then go see The Incredibles, and enjoy every minute. But I wouldn't bring someone younger than 4 maybe, because it isn't really aimed at them, and they probably would find it quite scary.This is a great film, one of the best of 2004 in my opinion. If it just had a slightly higher gag rate, than this would be an absolutely perfect picture.9/10"
740,tt0368891,9,"**********SPOILER WARNING************I had the pleasure of seeing this film twice at the theater. The only shows where I've seen the audience more into a movie were Spider-man 1 & 2, X-MEN 2, and Rocky. The movie is interesting from start to finish. While all the actors (and actress) do a good job, Sean Bean steals the show. So many times, the villain can make or break the film. Sean Bean was the absolute best choice for this particular villain. The characters arrogance, intelligence, and relentless resolve shine through. I feel the main drawback to the film was its PG rating. It would have been better as a PG-13. Some obvious violence was toned down. Even people that never use foul language, would have dropped the ""F"" bomb here and there. But as it stands with its PG rating, everyone can enjoy it."
741,tt0368891,7,"This is a fun movie that most everyone in the family can enjoy. It's rated PG, has some violence, but no nudity and no language. Younger kids will probably not understand the Masonic and Knights Templar references, but they'll probably still enjoy it. The only thing anyone needs to understand about the Masons is the Knights Templar eventually became the Masons, and many of our founding fathers were Masons, so there's a bit of Masonic lore/connection tied into the movie. Other than that, it's easy to follow. Ben Gates is chasing a dream of finding a lost treasure, the map to which is supposedly hidden on the back of the Declaration of Independence. He steals the Declaration, then takes off on his adventure to find the treasure. To put it simply, ""National Treasure"" will remind you of a cross between the Indiana Jones trilogy (minus the snakes) and ""Ocean's 11"" (minus the drinking and profanity). You don't have to be a genius to watch it, and you don't have to be a history nut to understand it. No, there isn't really a map on the back of the Declaration of Independence (Is there?), but Indiana Jones didn't actually find the Ark, either. It's a fun, fantasy, what-if, kind of movie. Enjoy it."
742,tt0368891,7,"National Treasure was not on my must-watch list. but it turned out to be a most pleasant surprise. the history behind the show may not be accurate and it also has around it, an air of mystery, but it certainly was a fun filled ride with the face-paced action flicks! I'm NOT a particular Cage fan. nonetheless i had to admit he did a pretty good job as Ben Gates - slightly serious yet very witty! together with Riley, they provided the tickles that brought the audience through the entire film.with no explicit language and scenes, National Treasure is well-suited for family entertainment! its a light-hearted film good for an evening of chilling out! the subtle love story also adds credit to the film.well done!"
743,tt0368891,8,"""National Treasure"" seemed the most innocuous of the offerings at the discount house, and one of the kids had been agitating to see it for a month or so. I gave in.I'm glad I did.""National Treasure"" is a welcome throwback of a film. The hero's a little scuffed around the edges, but clearly one of the good guys. The reluctant (at first) heroine is spunky, smart and beautiful. The baddie is wealthy, charming and accented. And the sidekick's a scream.Nicolas Cage does well in that he doesn't try to play Benjamin Gates like Harrison Ford playing Indiana Jones. There's a bit of the geek buried none too deep in Cage's performance, and the only time he gets rough with a bad guy, he hurts his hand.Justin Bartha's overgrown-kid persona provides plenty of comic relief -- and it's a relief in itself that ""National Treasure"" doesn't fall back on the ""kill the sidekick"" formula. The film needs him, and it needs him all the way through.Diane Kruger and Sean Bean do a fine job of portraying two sides of the same coin: Immigrants obsessively chasing the American Dream. The difference is in their interpretation of the dream.There's one on screen death, not gory. There's little, if any, profanity. Brainpower, not firepower, carries the day. And there's a genuine regard for learning throughout the film (although, admittedly, a few of the facts are off).And yes, there are moments when you realize that being an old-school film hero means leading a particularly charmed life. After all, given the seasonal changes in the sun's daily position, what are the odds of it making a shadow fall just so -- just when the good guys need it to? But that's the way it is in a good hidden-treasure epic: When truth and right are on your side, someone makes sure you get the breaks.There's a moral buried in the ending, too, that can be taken either way. Sharing is good -- but is it sharing of physical wealth, or of a political ideal? Given the obvious reverence for the Founding Fathers and their philosophies in ""National Treasure,"" the answer might be ""and"" rather than ""or."" All in all, far better than I had expected. Not earth-shatteringly significant, but family-friendly, well-paced and a whole lot of escapist fun."
744,tt0368891,8,"20 November 2004. National Treasure is the all-American movie about good vs. evil which is just what the American audience needs at this time in the face of America's war in Iraq. With a great dose of Lara Croft's lofty beginning theme along with Raiders of the Lost Ark sort of comedy and action adventure, throw in some nice high-tech, Enemy of the State themes and this movie is a gang-buster of a movie for the American public. It starts out with such action that it has difficulty keeping up the pace and the editing become a problem through its length and slower pace that it seems too long until the exciting climax that avoids the unbelievable ending of most movies. The romance and the nice contrast of bad guy-blow'em approach vs. the more subtle good guy approach makes this movie enjoyable. This is a great movie of the moment, for its time and audience, though not a classic by any means, it's great entertainment of the moment. Eight out of Ten Stars."
745,tt0368891,8,I enjoy my action/adventure movies so finally checked this one out and it was a lot of fun This is basically mission impossible meets Indiana Jones how cool is that?!
803,tt0385726,1,"I was a Texas Western graduate in 1966 and attended the school all four previous years that Don Haskins (""the Bear"") coached the basketball team. Of course, Coach Haskins came to TWC in 1961 and built his team over 5 years, not in one year as the movie tells it. I went to every home game in 1965-66 and remember every one as if it were yesterday. I watched all of the away games that were televised, including all of the games the Miners played in the NCAA tournament. Even though the producers of ""Glory Road"" took considerable artistic license, the story is mostly true. Here are some facts. The Miners blew away fourth ranked Iowa during a holiday tournament that season. It wasn't even close as the movie depicts it. The great comeback was against New Mexico in the ""Pit"". When Hispanic guard David Palacio came in to play in the second half, the team seemed to settle down and came from a 20 point deficit to win in overtime. The incredibly close game, and probably best game in America that year between the true best college teams in America was the Regional final between third ranked TWC and fourth ranked Kansas (not #1 Kentucky and #2 Duke in the final four semifinal), when Jo Jo White made that last second basket in overtime with his foot on the base line. The Miners went on to beat Kansas 81-80 in double overtime. Then the Miners beat Utah in the first game of the final four. If white player Jerry Armstrong hadn't defended against Utah's great Jerry Chambers, a black player, the Miners probably wouldn't have made it to the championship game against Kentucky. Chambers was beating every defender badly, including Lattin, Shed, and Flournoy, until Armstrong was put in to cover him. Chambers finished with 38 points, mostly in the first half and was the tournament's MVP.Coach Haskins is beloved by every El Pasoan, whether living in the city now or not, and is a true American treasure. It's wonderful for the rest of the country and the world to finally learn about ""the Bear"" and his great 1966 Miner team that El Paso has known and loved for 40 years. It's much more than a basketball story, it's a story about tolerance and what hard work and discipline can do through the leadership and determination of a great coach and human being.The acting was superb, especially Josh Lucas' performance as ""the Bear"". His performance was spot on. The young actors playing on the team were outstanding. The early tensions shown between the black and white players in the movie did not exist according to the real players on that team. The book ""Glory Road"" is a must read, because it tells the true story told by ""the Bear"", Don Haskins, himself. I also recommend David Lattin's book ""Slam Dunk to Glory"". The producers should have shown the real life characters, including Coach Haskins, Pat Riley, and some of the actual 1966 players earlier in the credits, because most of the audiences leave the theater without knowing they're going to be interviewed. I thought that was the most interesting part of the movie. The movie and the story deserve a perfect 10. I hope it wins some awards."
746,tt0368891,7,"""National Treasure"" is a thriller that was obviously targeted for young audiences. John Turtletaub, its director, has created a film that will resonate with those audiences because of the great ride and the adventure it depicts. On the other hand, heaven help us, should anyone feel inspired to emulate the hero of the film and attempts to do something similar, which in a way, doesn't say much about the security in guarding the real ""natural treasures"" of the country.If we can believe Ben Gates can pull the caper, then there's no problem in enjoying this film, which offers an action packed couple of hours that could have been trimmed a little bit to make it even better.Not being a Nicolas Cage fan, one was prepared for the worst, but this is one of the films in which Mr. Cage is at his mellowest intensity and it's easy to tolerate his antics. Diane Kreuger is a beautiful addition to the film that pays well. Justin Bartha does what he can being a computer nerd and pulling fantastic stuff to help his friend. Sean Bean, Christopher Plummer and Jon Voight, are seen in supporting roles.This is a film that will play well with young minds and with adults that will allow for the silliness of the situation at hand."
747,tt0368891,7,"This was a fun film, sort of like an Indian Jones movie, but the treasure hunter must figure out clues. I'm sure the reason this was made and released now has a lot to do with the Da Vinci Code. The plot is just like it except instead of involving religious history, the clues center around American history, and namely the founding fathers.So Nick Cage, plays Ben Gates, the treasure hunter whose family has been looking for the treasure of the knights templer for years. One of his relatives possessed the last remaining clue from a dying Mason. So, the movie starts with Cage finally solving that clue, and the film goes from there. Of course, we have the evil billionaire guy who wants the treasure for himself and the funny sidekick. But, I think the sidekick failed because he wasn't all that funny. The movie could have used some more humor. And of course, Gates hooks up with a beautiful woman along the way to help him solve the clues, which sounds just like Da Vinci.It is unbelievable that someone could just come up with the answer to these difficult clues after thinking about them for 2 minutes, but we don't have time to let the characters ponder them for a few months. It is meant to be fun, so forget about the plot holes. The whole set beneath the church looked very neat, but I would have to think all those wooden stairs would have been rotten by then and no one could walk on them. But who cares, it's fun.And the theft of the Declaration of Independence was reminiscent of Ocean's 11. Funny how anyone can steal anything in a film, forget locked down security.FINAL VERDICT: If you like adventure films, I recommend it. It is not like Tomb Raider, which some have compared it to. Tomb Raider was horrible. This is more like Indiana Jones."
748,tt0368891,7,"I am NOT, repeat, NOT, a Nicolas Cage fan, mainly because he relies too much on action to carry his films (instead of his acting), but this is a pretty decent flick. There is enough action and suspense to keep the viewer's interest and also to maintain the pace of the film. There's actually not very much actual violence (strange for a Cage film!), but the story is so well-written that even Cage can pull it off without any gore. The basic story has been reviewed several times, but it's the continuation of a 200 year old treasure hunt. Cage must solve riddle after riddle to find the ultimate clue to the treasure's whereabouts. The clue is finally determined to be on the back of the Declaration of Independence. How Cage figures the clue that leads him there is pretty far-fetched but its the key to the story. If you buy into that, the rest of the riddles are acceptable. There's also a double cross plot headed by the great Sean Bean that provides a lot of the action. The lovely Diane Kruger portrays the poor lady who gets caught up in the middle of all this intrigue. Overall, except for the figuring out of the clue found in the ship (the viewer just has to assume that he's that far above the rest of us in intelligence), a pretty exciting film with a little something for everyone."
749,tt0368891,1,"I am shocked and appalled that anyone thinks this movie deserves less than 10/10. In one of Nic Cages only 2 decent movies (the other being National Treasure 2: Book of Secrets) he plays a 6th generation treasure hunter on a mission to find gold and teach us about Ye olde USA. Going on a journey from New York to DC to Philadelphia and back again, will he ever find the treasure? Or will arch nemesis and all round bad boy Sean Bean get there first?"
750,tt0417415,1,"I did not see the IMAX version, so maybe that makes a difference. I just watched the DVD, which was long. However, it seems like a lot of people did not get the point of this movie, which was absolutely excellent and very exciting. We are on the frontier of a lot of exciting discoveries, and leaps and bounds are being made in marine exploration. People complain that the animals shown were not explained enough. That's because THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS. They say ""Oooh, look at that! Wow! What is it?"". This is exploration, people. They are finding new types of animals. If they can't capture it, they are going to have to take pictures of it and study how it moves etc. etc. and go through a long process of figuring out what it is and how it lives. The point of this movie wasn't necessarily to show pretty pictures of all of the animals, although I was stunned by the visual beauty of it. The point was to tie marine exploration to space exploration, hence the title. I loved seeing what goes on with the machinery and finding out all of the different people involved in this research, showing us all the different groups that come together from different fields to explore together and work on their individual goals. A lot of people complained that they didn't want to see the engineers and the subs and robots, but the people who do that incredible work should get more credit than they often do and should definitely be introduced in the movie. This technology is absolutely amazing and the people who do it deserve to brag. They are showing us the incredible things that the human mind can achieve. I also loved seeing how excited they were.This movie has a lot of very important things to say and did a great job illustrating the massive activity going on in this sector of science. Not only has it made me enthused about the things I'm going to see in my lifetime, it has made me believe that one of those things is probably going to be life on another planet. After day after day of being depressed about the state the world is in, petty political and religious arguments, seeing this movie definitely made me feel hope for the human race again. These people put most of us to shame. This movie doesn't deserve to get blasted the way it has been and these brilliant folks don't deserve to be called ""retards"". How silly! So maybe you don't like the way it looked, or thought they should have done something different. Whatever. These guys are ridiculously hardworking, are doing amazing things, and are trying to show the world and let us get in on it. Geez. People just love to insult things."
751,tt0407121,9,"It's been awhile since I've watched Winnie The Pooh,and I was abit unsure about watching another again when my sisters rented it out. The thing is that I loved it! It's a very cute movie with cute original characters and It has a Very nice story and I don't have a problem when watching it again. It begins where all of a sudden there's been some strange happenings in the Hundred Acre Wood and Winnie the pooh and his friends try to get to the bottom of it,only to find out that Heffalumps (Big elephants) have moved in. The rest I leave to you to find out,but overall it's cute,fun and something that you can never be too old to watch. So yeah,watch it...it's definitely something that kids as well as the rest will enjoy. PS: Note how many ""cutes"" I've put in,if it's more than 2 then it's worth a movie ticket."
752,tt0407121,9,"At 18, you may think I am a little old to be watching this movie, but as a lover of the Winnie the Pooh characters I thought why not? So I watched Pooh's Heffalump Movie and was delighted by it. It is so charming, sweet and endearing and has a lot of heart too. Plenty of funny and touching moments here too. It isn't as good as the 1977 movie or the 80s TV show, but it is still a delightful movie, with enough charm for especially children. Adults may complain there aren't enough jokes for them, but if they see the movie they will probably be content by their child's happy smile as they watch it and by the charm the film has.The film is very short, but it moves very quickly and doesn't feel boring. The story is also very simple, but it is effective and innocent with a nice message that I actually didn't find preachy. The animation is lovely, and the music while not the best in the world is still delightful and serves its purpose very well. Even the dialogue had some nice moments- I smiled and I was moved too. The characters are a delight, especially Lumpy who is so cute and endearing I fell in love with him the very first moment I set eyes on him. And the voice acting is excellent. Overall, charming and delightful. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
753,tt0395699,8,"Okay, sometimes I think the critics are all single ""non-family"" people. I just got back from viewing this movie with 7 adults and 11 children. It was wonderful to watch the kids giggle and hurrah at Vin Diesel, tough guy, nice guy, real softie routine. Whether he was kicking bad guys or changing diapers, he was great. While there were many clichés and material we've all seen in other forms, we sometime forget that this stuff works. My child is 8 and this is fresh to him. I'm so please that we were able to bring 18 people of varying ages who all had a good time. I say forget the negatives and focus on what we sometimes forget, an afternoon or evening with you kids is the best pacifier."
754,tt0395699,7,"It's not rocket science, but who cares. Turn off the brain, and sit down with the kids for a good solid family comedy. Vin Diesel plays a tough guy with a big heart, he just has to find it. In the process he helps to save the world and defeat the bad guys. The children playing the Plummer family work well together, you could believe that they could be a real family (problems and all). Lauren Graham plays the principal of the school and the ""love"" interest for Vin Diesel very well. Their attraction is ""cute"" but not overdone. Brad Garrett as the vice-principal provides the off the wall character that is often presented in this script formula. His character was probably one of the main characters that could have been written better, but was passable. Pop the popcorn for a bit of a corny film and have some fun"
755,tt0395699,2,"I was fortunate to win tickets to a preview of this movie from a local radio station,for myself and my three daughters (9,11 and 14). I did not expect to enjoy this movie, and was simply glad to be there for their sake. It was very entertaining and Vin Diesel did a great job, especially considering it was a comedy. Often when an action star attempts comedy it fails miserably. I rate this movie 8 out of 10 stars, and my daughters all loved it as well. We talked and laughed about it all the way home. I am certain that a few of the catch phrases will be with us for a while. This movie was a blast. Disney did a great job with this one."
756,tt0395699,6,"Okay, first this movie is great for what it is meant to be, a family friendly comedy romp. It has funny moments, touching moments, it gives you chuckles and even a few laughs. It isn't trying to win awards or stun the audience with special effects. You sit down, watch it, laugh a little, think about how cute the kids are, then go on with the rest of your day. A lot of action stars have taken a turn at comedy to soften their image, Stallone and Arnold S. to name a couple, so Vin Diesel is in good company there. I think it is a decent, light movie worth at least a matinée viewing. The kids are charmers, Vin Diesel doesn't seem to mind being the but of jokes, and most of the acting is good. And ladies, he spends most of the movie in tight t-shirts, and according to my wife has a nice posterior region. Guys you have to settle for Lauren Graham's sweet smile."
757,tt0395699,1,"Probably one of my most enjoyable movie experiences ever. My (22-year-old) daughter and her friend are Vin Diesel fans, and I like stupid movies, so we went off to see this with no particular expectations. It was delightful! The acting was good, the writing was just off-kilter enough to surprise, and the plot, while predictable, was only predictable a few seconds in advance (which is about how long it took for Vin Diesel's character to process a thought). Our little group of cynics was charmed and quoting lines from the movie all the way home afterwards. We agreed that it was indeed a Disney movie, but it didn't have the cheesy hollowness and wannabe withitness that has hampered those productions since Hayley Mills was my age. Bits of it were unexpectedly moving. Vin Diesel's little side romance was also charming, with a breath of gentle kinkiness (""On land, you're the superior officer,"" he says to his honey, and she smirks.) Basically it was funny, stupid, and sweet without being annoying, and Vin Diesel was excellent in it. I'll buy it when it comes out in video, or my daughter will--she works in a trendy video store, so that she liked the movie is saying a lot."
758,tt0395699,7,"In brief: ""A bit more cutesy than ""Kindergarten Cop,"" but more family-friendly, and Vin Diesel shows his versatility.""I don't usually attend screenings for kids' movies, but when I first found out about this film, I was very curious to see how Vin Diesel would do in a kid's film. I've liked Vin Diesel ever since ""Pitch Black"", and while some may dismiss him as a muscle-bound action workhorse, I've long thought that there was more to him lurking behind that facade, and remembering the skepticism that greeted Arnold Schwarzenegger's attempts at comedyskepticism that was greeted with what I thought were successful turns in ""Twins"" and ""Kindergarten Cop"", I was curious to see how successfully Diesel would play against type.The result is a family film more cutesy and farcical than ""Kindergarten Cop"", (the model my mind kept going back to for comparison), with an unfortunately greater focus on infant waste products, but greater conflict between Diesel and his young charges, which lends itself to more heartwarming moments of rapport-building. Diesel plays Lt. Shane Wolfe, a Navy SEAL assigned to protect the five children of a top scientist (Tate Donovan), and find a hidden computer program that may be secreted in his house while their mother (Faith Ford) and Wolfe's C.O. journey to Zurich to try and find the right code word for the scientist's safety deposit box. A simple assignment, it seems, except these kids have issues. Eldest son Seth is defiant, suffers bullying from fellow students and the school's V.P., and is negligent in his wrestling team responsibilities. Oldest daughter Zoe (""American Dreams""'s Brittany Snow) is truant in her Driver's Ed class, and willfully disobedient. The problems of the youngest three, Lulu, Peter, and Tyler, seem simpler, but are no less mountainous for Wolfe, who first tries addressing these problems with the roughshod military discipline he's accustomed to, but soon finds himself changing tactics by listening to these kids' problems, and helping them out more as a parent than a military bodyguard. Whereas Schwarzenegger's character was instantly ingratiated with the object of his protection in ""Kindergarten Cop"" by becoming friends and eventually boyfriend to his mom, and merely had to win his class' attention, here Wolfe has the more difficult task of cutting through the layers of resentment in a pair of teenagers, taking care of an infant and two young children, and protecting them from assassins that come crashing through windows, which lends itself to both some genuinely warm moments when he opens up to Seth and Zoe, and some surprisingly interesting but funny action sequences that seem evocative of Jackie Chan, with a really nice setup-and-payoff when Wolfe realizes the secret to getting to the computer program.This is obviously a film geared more for the kids, as evidenced by the kooky overacting, the silly Swiss stereotypes (which I didn't even realized existed), and the goofy actions on the part of the bad guys, such as the revelation, for example, that squirting a juice box into a bad guy's face is akin to spraying it with acid (and somehow keeps the bad guy from falling backward in response), but while that may be a let-down to the older folk, the parents will probably be pleased, since I recall some parents being upset with the more adult scenes in ""Kindergarten Cop"". The bottom line is, bring the kids to see it, but if unless you're a die-hard Diesel fan, and want to see anything he does, it probably won't be your cup of tea if you're past grade school."
759,tt0395699,8,"Vin Diesel? In a Comedy? Yes! And he's awesome! I'm hoping this doesn't indicate a genre change for Diesel-I love watching his actioners, but when he decides he needs to retire, he should definitely give comedy a sincere consideration. This wasn't ""awesome,"" but it was highly enjoyable.The premise has been done before...when I saw the previews for this work, I thought, ""Just another Suburban Commando ripoff."" I'm happy to report that this endeavor is so much more than that, and stands alone, without any connection to that work than a military character in a suburban setting. Everything else is different, and well executed by these gifted child actors and Vin Diesel in his most lovable role.I highly recommend this work to any family who are looking for something worthy in which to invest their movie time.It rates a 7.6/10 from...the Fiend :."
767,tt0396652,9,"Besides what the cynics will see Ice Princess is an undeniable bubblegum treat and despite it's sometimes lapse in logic makes an agreeable sports film both emotional and intense. Trachtenberg of Buffy fame stars as the title star a physics geek in school whom when offered the opportunity to go to college with a scholarship, decides to base her summer project on figure skating and the physics proportions of what would accustom special movements and such. In that she finds a passion she's long denied herself because of her over bearing, feminist, college professor MOM played wonderfully by Joan Cusack whom of course thinks it's just a waste of time. The film is of course a clash of overly obvious clichés but anyone seeing this film should know that already. But these are the clichés that make movies like this truly inspiring and enjoyable. The film is fun, memorable and heart tugging. But the standout addition here is a wonderful performance by the still gorgeous Kim Catrall she's still in mean mode but god can she deliver those lines and still come off likable ultimately. So throwout what cynics will say about this sleeper treat and go experience this gold medal for your selves. 9/10"
760,tt0396652,7,"Ice Princess was typical family fluff that was an enjoyable hour and 1/2 escape from the tensions of real life. With that in mind, it was a great success as entertainment and release from stress.The plot is simple and ""age worn"" - a teen named Casey (Michelle Trachtenberg) is torn between fulfilling the dreams of her parent or following her own dreams. Nothing new here. Yet, the supporting characters of Gen Harwood (Hayden Panettiere) and her mother Tina (Kim Cattrall) also have the same situation. Tina, a skating coach, wants her daughter to become a skating champion, an achievement Tina was unable to fulfill in her own skating career. Thus, both Gen and Casey have something in common: pleasing mom or pleasing themselves.Yet, Gen and Casey were dramatically different. Casey was a brilliant student with her eyes on Harvard while being gifted at skating, too. Meanwhile, Gen excelled only by becoming a slave to skating and sacrificing her schoolwork.And it is with that difference that I believe Disney missed the potential. The ""Casey's"" of the world are few and far between, and it is difficult to relate to them: ""Oh, gee. Will I go to Harvard because I'm brilliant at school? Or will I become a skating champion because I'm brilliant on the ice?"" Because she is so distant from the vast majority of people, she never truly grabbed my empathy.Gen, on the other hand, is very, very real. She is being pushed into a sport by a parent, and her social life and academics are suffering. She faces a real dilemma. Plus, she has no hope of excelling at either academics or skating. Her social life is her only escape from this vise. And Gen is endearing because she seems to have a ""good heart"" despite the difficulty. And how often we see kids with ""good hearts"" trapped by situations.I believe that most of us can relate much better to Gen than to Casey. I would have preferred the character of Gen to be the focus of the story with Casey's character in the supporting role. It would be tougher, grittier, and more meaningful to the audience.Yeah, we all cheered for Casey, but I was cheering for Gen even more."
761,tt0396652,8,"ICE PRINCESS is not the kind of movie to which this reviewer is usually attracted - the trappings indicate that we are in for a happy-wappy, sterilized, PG, Disney candy box. But, surprise!, here is a film that is better than its package. Writers Meg Cabot and Hadley Davis have combined the sport of ice skating with the drama of teenage angst and come up with a credible tale of a 'science geek' discovering her talent and following her dream of figure skating.Director Tim Fywell knows his way around the ice rink and the halls and lockers of high school kids and his preparation for the film is apparent. Casey (Michelle Trachtenberg) is a fine student who is encouraged by her physics professor to find a project that incorporates her personality along with physics that will assist her in gaining a scholarship to Harvard. Casey's mother (Joan Cusack) is a pragmatist, a schoolteacher who wants Casey to succeed beyond the mother's status. Casey loves to skate on their home pond, but one day happens into a private skating rink class owned by one-time star skater Tina (Kim Cattrall), a place where Tina relentlessly drives her daughter Gen (Hayden Panettiere) toward winning prizes. Tina's son Teddy (Trevor Blumas - a much underused handsome actor) is always around to keep the ice surfaces smooth with his machine.Casey observes the brilliance of fine skating, thinks of a way to analyze moves on her computer that will diagnose aerodynamic physics aspects of skating, and once that is perfected, and she is able to aid the skaters with her scientific knowledge, she personalizes her theories. Before long has won a place along with the other aspiring skaters. She encounters resistance from her mother, encouragement from Tina, and friendship from Gen and her fellow skaters as well as the eye of Teddy! When Casey has her Harvard interview, she admits that her real love is for skating, not physics, and commits to pursuing that love full time. The rest is predictable: all's well that end's well.What sets this little film apart is the quality of acting from Trachtenberg, Cattrall, Cusack and Blumas: they create characters about whom we care. The skating is fun to watch, and the 'sitting in the bleachers rooting for the good guys' feeling is refreshing. This is not a great film but certainly one of the best of this genre. It is most definitely a 'feel good' popcorn movie! Grady Harp"
762,tt0396652,7,"This movie was typical Disney; a sweet feel-good story despite some mediocre acting and plot holes. Michelle Trachtenberg is a very likable heroine, and both Joan Cusack and Kim Cattrall perform admirably in their respective roles. Granted, the ""child breaks away from parent's desires to follow her own dream"" story has been done many times, and this version is nothing special, but it's good for us well-intentioned mothers to be reminded every so often to let our children find their own paths in life.My only big gripe is with what is presented as Casey's incredible physics discoveries. Some of the statements are downright wrong (pulling in your arms while spinning DECREASES, not increases, your moment of inertia), and all the equations shown in the movie are nothing but basic laws of Newtonian mechanics. While the target pre-teen audience will be fooled, anyone older who's ever taken a physics class will not. Come on, Hollywood...with all the recent publicity about whether women are suited for math and science, please don't insult our intelligence by assuming that scientific details are unimportant in a movie marketed to young girls."
763,tt0396652,1,"This 'chase your dream/against all odds' fantasy is a light diversion in a Hollywood culture steeped in blockbuster mode. Ice Princess attempts to treat the issue of female achievement with both charm and weightiness. One is almost tempted (I say almost tempted because it still falls under the very successful Disney Channel formula of a challenged teenage life and happy ending) to forgive the every ready show of single motherhood as fanatical stage moms driving their kids to the fulfillment of their dreams rather than encouraging the same to seek happiness and true fulfillment.Both Kim Cattral and Joan Cusak play mothers who pressure their daughters into career they seemed all too disappointed about not having achieved. Their daughters, in effect, are stand-ins of their own unfulfilled dreams. Casey, the true focus of the movie is played by Michelle Trachtenberg, as a Harvard-bound physics nerd who aspires to challenge all the planning and hard work to become a world class figure skater. Conversely Gen, played by Hayden Panettiere, is the Cattral prodigy who is forced into the role of apprentice skating champ - chasing her mother's Olympic dreams - the dreams lost when she lost (disqualified, as the story goes) in Sarajevo - and just wants to be normal. True to the Hollywood/Disney formula there is the perfunctory supportive and accessible 'hunk' (who just happens to be Gen's bother) in Trevor Blumas. Directed by Tim Fywell and written by Hadley Davis, Ice Princess is a story pegged on the duality of very pushy mothers in Cusak and Cattral whose daughters are being pushed in the direction that runs counter to their dreams.Despite the movie's predictability, the Ice Princess had moments of seriousness (almost lapses, actually) in the core subject matter of passionate loyalties amidst the cutthroat competitiveness of the figure-skating world. Yes, you will be treated to the attractive figure skating but Fywell is not tempted to push it over the top. Cusack and Cattrall bring a mature complexity to their difficult roles as mothers who are trying to control the raging hormones and resultant attitude. Problematic in some areas, the movie does bring to presence the very important issues of coming of age, parental interference, and long term career planning. Unrealistic at best, to think that after all that was invested, a Harvard bound student (not to mention the Olympic bound skater) would throw it all away on a one-in-a-million chance at 'true happiness' but we can always live vicariously in this imaginary space - which is why we will continue to be attracted to movies like Ice Princess.Miguel Llora"
764,tt0396652,1,"I saw this and was like wow. I really didn't want to see it, honestly. I thought it looked like one of those cheesy Disney movies, but I was extremely wrong. It was a great movie for kids & parents alike, and definitely a mother and daughter movie. I thought it was perfect, and it was so cute, I came out of there wishing I was an ice skater its just one of the movies, that make you think to yourself, ""Wow, I wish I could do that."" A lot of my friends thought this movie was a little weird but me and my friends were siting there crying after this movie. It was adorable in every way, and I don't think it possibly could be better, the only complaint I actually do have is the ending kiss between her and the boy, it wasn't romantic at all, if that was a little more romantic I thought that would be perfect.;] Thanks for reading, Krista"
765,tt0396652,1,"I loved this movie, and I don't know why the other reviewer did not. Maybe said reviewer was not accustomed to viewing Disney movies, which are generally cleaner and more family-oriented. The star of the film worked her hardest against all obstacles to accomplish her goals and realize her dreams, without throwing away her intelligence. She learned that intelligence is not a burden, as it is often portrayed, but a gift that can possibly be applied to many other areas of life. The main character was a well-developed character, as were the supporting characters, and the soundtrack was excellent. I truly enjoyed this movie, and it was a joy to watch. I shall hope to see it again before it is released on DVD."
766,tt0396652,4,"This is an easy movie to watch and I would have liked it, if it weren't for the ending. The characters are charming and quirky. The application of physics to ice skating is interesting. It's nice to have a girl-lead who is brainy and awkward, yet cute and confident, and who falls for the Zamboni driver, instead of the quarterback. It was also a pleasure to see girls be supportive of each other, instead of nasty. So why did they ruin it all by suggesting that it was right for an 18 year old girl to choose pursuing ice skating (which she has been doing competitively for less than a year) over a scholarship to Harvard (a lifetime experience likely to lead to amazing opportunities for her future)? Let's teach girls that it's good to be a geek!"
1189,tt0926129,4,"So, Prom Night was supposed to be a horror and thriller movie. I'm a big wuss and was scared to see this movie at the beginning, but upon seeing it, it is neither horror or thriller.I was basically making fun of the movie in my seat because it was so predictable. You could predict what was going to happen next. The young actors were alright at playing their characters, but I'd have to say the killer was definitely at the top of the game - acting wise.Yes, I'll give props for the plot because it was good, but it's not thrilling or scary. There were almost zero ""jump-in-your-seat"" scenes. So, don't waste ten dollars seeing it in theatres, wait 'til it comes to DVD."
768,tt0396652,6,"---Another Warning! This is kinda biased, being reviewed by a REAL ice skater!-- Originally I did not want to see this movie, considering the trailers made it look absolutely fabricated, and on top of that a chick flick. However, just yesterday my mom and I decided to rent it for laughs. Well, knowing the true side of the ice skating business, I can truthfully say that this movie only partly gives you the truth about figure skating.Don't get me wrong: the movie itself is fine for one who wants mindless entertainments, and the lead stars (Joan, Kim, and Michelle) shine. However, the idea that there's a formula behind jumps and spins is completely ridiculous.""Fold your arms in to go tighter,""""Push your toe pick in to get more force,"" Seriously, I think that's more common sense than physics.The competition-sectionals-was terrible. Since when did a competition for teens get on ESPN? Never. Nor, unfortunately, are competitions ever that packed. Also, the songs/programs the skaters preformed...It almost makes you wonder if they were actually doing freestyle, or the more likely event artistic. Definitely Zoe's program would not be allowed at Sectionals. Actually, none of the programs except the Asian girl's could have been allowed. They were all too... showy. There are tons of other problems, too, but this is getting too long.All in all, if you really don't care and just want to see a movie without listening to my rants, see this movie. If you want a real look at ice skating, don't."
769,tt0396652,9,"I thought it was great how there wasn't any ugliness in the whole movie! It was a totally positive movie! Positive, you just don't get that anymore. It was nice to take my girls to a movie that I wasn't squirming in my seat hoping that nothing foul or nasty would pop up! I wish there were more movies out there like that. Not everything has to have sex or cursing to sell! I had to give it only a 9 out of 10 though because I thought the editing was a little choppy. I'm not a film expert by any means so the fact that I noticed it says something, I think. Although, it was still better than Raise Your Voice, the editing in that was horrible!"
770,tt0405325,8,"I got to go see Sky High at a free preview last night. When I saw the commercials, I wrote this movie off immediately. It looked like a strictly-for-kids, stupid-but-cute, teeny-bopper funfest. Blech!I was pleasantly surprised! I love going into a movie like this with low expectations and being proved wrong. I am a hardcore comics fan (""weenie"" I believe the earlier reviewer said) and I still found a lot to like here.The movie has a better take on what a superhero world would actually be like than many ""serious"" movies. It was almost like a kids version of the ""Astro City"" comic book.The jokes really made Sky High for me! I wont spoil any for you but I will point out that the cast included Bruce Campbell, Kevin McDonnell, Dave Foley and Lynda Carter!If you're a comics fan, go see it! If you've got kids and want to have a fun evening, go see it!I am kinda hoping that this becomes Disney's next live-action series."
771,tt0405325,7,"I saw ""Sky High"" at a preview screening tonight, and I must say I was pleasantly surprised! A lot of laughs for kids and grownups, a couple of good plot twists, and a nice message for the youngsters. Kurt Russell steals the show as an over-the-top super hero, who wants nothing more than for his son to follow in the family business. Kelly Preston looks amazing as his flying super hero wife. A great group of kids play the Sky High students, with cool effects to help them into their roles... and some nice parables about life in high school. I expected lots of eye rolling and lame super hero humor... but there was no lameness, no eye rolls, but plenty of good laughs and sweet moments. Parents, feel free to go with your kids to this one!"
772,tt0405325,8,"I think Disney misfired with the very poor The Pacifier and had higher expectations from the Herbie movie. But they'll do surprisingly well with this kids flick, I think. Perhaps we even have a sleeper here.When I saw the Sky High trailer I thought I was going to see the next installment of Spy Kids. Okay, there are a lot of crazy special effects in this movie, but the story is actually driven by the nice performances by almost all the actors instead of lots of SFX.The film is about young Will Stronghold (charming performance by Michael Angarano), son of the two most popular and successful superheroes in the world, The Commander (Kurt Russell) and Jetstream (Kelly Preston). Will is about to go to Sky High, a school especially founded for superheroes, but there's one problem: he doesn't own any superpower. Instead of being a superhero, his highest goal seems to be the one of sidekick. So how can he survive at school being the son of the world most famous super duo? And how will his parents react when they hear the bad news?Sky High is a very entertaining family movie with lots of good hearted humor. Early in the movie Bruce Campbell (oh yeah!) steals the show as (ex-hero, now teacher) Sonic Boomer, who has a 'Sorting Hat' scene in which he determines which student will go to hero class and which ones will study for sidekick. Kurt Russell gives a great tongue-in-cheek performance as proud daddy who thinks it's great that his son defeats all the bullies at school but has to condemn it in front of his wife. And that's the opinion of a someone who isn't actually a fan of the actor himself. The original little ideas dry out after the first half of the movie, but who said that all family movies should have Oscar power?Sky High is a movie about friendship, falling in love with the wrong girl, falling in love with the right girl and trying to succeed in your parents footsteps. Very entertaining for the kids, and some nice laughs for parents too (during the Sidekick lessons given by ex-All American Boy for instance: lots a references to the Robin from the Batman TV-series). Great 80's soundtrack as well, with covers from songs by The Smiths, Talking Heads, Tears for Fears and even Till Tuesday and Modern English."
773,tt0405325,8,"I saw the advance screening of this movie last night and I have to say that I was very pleasantly surprised! I went into this movie expecting a cheesy kiddy movie and ended up spending the next hour and a half being seriously entertained. The story is about a group of freshmen in their first few months at a super hero high school named ""Sky High."" There are all the familiar struggles of high school, such as fitting in, finding a date, and choosing between the friends you have known and loved your whole life and the new popular crowd. These high school newbies have the additional dilemma of learning to use their powers and live up to the reputations that their parents have established as super heroes. The movie is sweet without sending the viewers into a diabetic coma, and has a great message. The theater I was in was also full of little ones, who I never heard a peep out of! The movie is a great treat for the entire family and will make a great break from the heat or a rainy day activity!"
774,tt0405325,9,"This has the makings of a completely unoriginal hour and a half: super-hero's, high school, special effects. Much to my surprise, it's funny, well acted, and original. Apparently, this movie was in production before the Incredibles was released. It's not a result of the success.As someone who grew up during the Love Bug, Benji era of Disney live action kids movies, it's a nice change of pace. It was well worth the time and $. A family movie without a lot of violence, language, or sexual ""near misses"". Who'd a thunk it!"
775,tt0405325,7,"Well, I must say that this movie was surprisingly good for it being a Disney Kid Movie. Now it won't win any Oscars, but it really kept up the Disney Tradition for being a clean and fun film. It was wonderful to see Kurt Russell on the screen again with Disney. The acting, again, not an Oscar performance out of anyone, was clean and sincere, very believable. The sets and special effects were, well, good. The diversity and conflict between students of the school, once again... good. There were some very witty and dry remarks about high school life as well. Good writing. I say the most surprising thing about this film was that it was just plain old fun! It had the patrons laughing as well as I. My 7 year old and my 3 year old loved it and it was still adult enough with a strong enough plot to keep the parents interested as well. All in all, it made for a fun afternoon."
776,tt0405325,1,"This movie was awesome. I went with two other adults & we all enjoyed it. There were tons of young kids there & in typical Disney style lots of fun things the adults understood, but the kids didn't (like who the principal was in our youth)! The kids around me seemed to enjoy it, along with the adults. If you are looking for an action movie, this is not it, if you're looking for mystery & intrigue this is not it, if you're looking for amazing cinematography, not it, but if you're looking for a fun movie to go to with your family, this is the movie to go see. I got to go for free, but would definitely pay to go see it again!"
1239,tt2404027,9,"One word.. Excellent !! Its by far the best Hindi/ Indian animated movie ever. The story, in-spite of the deviations from popular mythology keep the viewer engaged.Dialogues are very well written. The lack of no name voice overs is actually a good thing. I wish they would take the Amar chitra katha series as inspiration and make a ton of more films like this. Its time to bring animated movies from India into the 21st century. I hope this team makes movies on other stories from the Mahabharata and gives it the same treatment. It would be even more awesome if they would release the movie with more regional language sound tracks and international ones to introduce the rest of the world to Indian mythology"
777,tt0405325,8,"I remember the days when I was a kid and loved Disney comedies. Son of Flubber, The Shaggy Dog, etc. Then there was the classic period after I got a little older with Kurt Russell Disney movies. Well those days are back and you can even take your kids. It is PG rather than the G of the old stuff but that is only because of violence and that violence is directed mostly at property. The characters are not killed or injured. (A lot better than the Bad News Bears which the theater had warnings up about being a STRONG PG 13). Anyway Kurt Russell is so campy in this one and (what a shock) so is Bruce Campbell. The plot and theme borrow a lot from the Incredibles (which is a good thing because I liked it the best of Pixar's flicks) Also you might think Hogwarts when you see the classes except the high school floats in the sky and rather than potions and avoiding the dark forces the student learn how to be superhero sidekicks and how to build ray guns in science class. Won't go any further on that except to say that those scenes are a hoot. Anyway the good guys win, the bad guys lose, the hero is taught lessons about life and everyone gets a laugh a minute as it all comes about."
778,tt0405325,9,"Kurt Russell went back to his Disney roots with Sky High, a fresh take on the superhero craze. The story revolves around Will Stronghold( Michael Angarano) who is the kid of two superhero parents, The Commander( Kurt Russell) and Jetstream( Kelly Preston). Will is off to be a freshman at his dad's alma mater- Sky High, a school for superheroes where they can find their powers and learn how to use them. High school angst is then thrown into the mix as Will and his new group of friends, headed up by the typical girl best friend Layla( Danielle Panabaker), are told they don't fit the superhero mold and become sidekicks, otherwise known as the losers of the school. I loved the idea of this movie and the people in it seemed to be having a great time. The roles were cast perfectly and it was easy to believe everyone. A few favorites were Warren Peace( Steven Strait), Layla and Zach( Nicholas Braun). Sure the plot was a tad predictable, both in the superhero plot and in the teen drama area but because of the setting and the mix it made it still worth seeing. Also, anything that has Bruce Campbell, who plays Coach Boomer, is automatically quirky enough to be given a chance. Of course the world ends up in danger and the underdogs must fight to save it, but for once I wasn't upset that I knew it all.Disney needed a hit as the past few movies it's put out that were live action failed to do much. I think Sky High is it. Action for the boys, cute boys and drama for the girls and Kurt Russell for the moms- great family movie. All I can end with is I can't wait for it to come out on video."
779,tt0405325,9,"I attended a screening of this movie last night and I must say this is  the only comic book film I have seen in a long time that I immediately  want to see again.  I was there with a row of press and was invited to bring my kids,  seeing as I do't have any I took my nephew. This boy is all over the  place most of the time, but he was rivited when the movie started and  when it ended he wanted toys, I don't think there are any.  I spent time at a round session conducting interviews of the cast and I  was lucky enough to run into the creator of Sky High, Paul Hernandez. Hernandez was surrounded by Latino press who were all hitting him with  questions. I was about to leave when he stopped me and said jokingly  ""don't worry, I speak English too."" We chatted about his attempt to set  this up as a television series in 94 and how he left the production to  work on Greatest American Hero at Disney, as well as Instant Karma for  New Line, a film he is directing staring the Rock and Pierce Brosnan.  With just the 10 min or so I spent with him, I could tell where the wit  and vision of this film came from."
780,tt0388980,8,"Bill Paxton has taken the true story of the 1913 US golf open and made a film that is about much more than an extra-ordinary game of golf. The film also deals directly with the class tensions of the early twentieth century and touches upon the profound anti-Catholic prejudices of both the British and American establishments. But at heart the film is about that perennial favourite of triumph against the odds.The acting is exemplary throughout. Stephen Dillane is excellent as usual, but the revelation of the movie is Shia LaBoeuf who delivers a disciplined, dignified and highly sympathetic performance as a working class Franco-Irish kid fighting his way through the prejudices of the New England WASP establishment. For those who are only familiar with his slap-stick performances in ""Even Stevens"" this demonstration of his maturity is a delightful surprise. And Josh Flitter as the ten year old caddy threatens to steal every scene in which he appears.A old fashioned movie in the best sense of the word: fine acting, clear directing and a great story that grips to the end - the final scene an affectionate nod to Casablanca is just one of the many pleasures that fill a great movie."
781,tt0388980,8,"I was extraordinarily impressed by this film. It's one of the best sports films I've every seen. The visuals in this film are outstanding. I love the sequences in which the camera tracks the ball as it flies through the air or into the cup. The film moves well, offering both excitement and drama. The cinematography was fantastic. The acting performances are great. I was surprised by young Shia LaBeouf.He does well in this role. Stephen Dillane is also good as the brooding Harry Vardon. Peter Firth, Justin Ashforth, and Elias Koteas offer able support. The film is gripping and entertaining and for the first time in my life actually made me want to watch a golf tournament."
782,tt0388980,1,"This movie gives golf a high mark, it was well acted and well directed. Giving you a view of history that some non-sports fans will enjoy. The historic factor alone gives it a high rating, the Brookline golf course was really done well. I am in the northeast and have seen Brookline as a fan, and as someone who loves the game. The movie was well done on all levels. A MUST SEE 5 stars. The acting was superb, Disney has another winner in its bag of Great movies. If for no other reason watch the film to give hope and encouragement to young people whom may not see the hope in their life. I would tell you that the setting, while in the late 1800's and early 1900's is very realistic. The costumes and dialect were right on the mark as well. Above and beyond the call of duty for a golf film. A Must see for fans and non-fans alike."
787,tt0388980,1,"I'm not a sports fan - but I love sports flics! So, why ... what is a great sports flic ... this one. And the storytelling style, is very fine.If you are looking for a reliably fantastic 2 hours of entertainment, ""Greatest Game"" qualifies mightily. Here is a movie that moves. Bill Paxton has gone to the same Director school as Ron Howard - a.k.a. Richie Cunningham, ""Happy Days"". That is not bad. Look at the immense body of fine work that Ron did after moving behind the camera.Bill like Ron was a great actor, but will be a superstar director if ""Greatest Game Ever"" is the indication of things to follow.Wonderful cinematography - fantastic direction - fine acting, especially by Elias Koteas, Shia LeBeouf, Marnie McPhail, Josh Flitter, Stephen Marcus, Justin Ashforth.This is a must see film not just as ""feel-good"", nor ""sports film"", this is very good cinema."
783,tt0388980,1,"Wow, here is another great golf movie. That's at least three in the past few years that I've really enjoyed, that were well-done, beautifully-filmed and inspirational. The other two were ""Bobby Jones: Stroke of Genius"" and ""The Legend Of Bagger Vance.""This is a true underdog story, if there ever was one. To have an amateur defeat all the professionals and win the United States Open Golf Tournament is an unheard-of feat. I believe this is the only time in the 100 years it has ever been accomplished. How much of this film is fiction embellished for dramatic effect, I don't know. I do know that I plan on reading the book, and I know that in real-life, Francis Ouimet had a three-stroke lead in playoff with just two holes to go, unlike what we saw in the film.Whatever. Francis Ouimet's victory over golf legends Harry Vardon and Ted Ray is fact. It is an amazing story and the filmmakers did a super job in presenting it here. It isn't something just for golf fans; this is a fun movie. Kudso to actor-turned-director Bill Paxton for an outstanding job.Yes, a lot of this is just plain golf but there are subplots such as Ouimet's relationship with his father and with a pretty young woman who is obviously interested in him. It's also a touching story of someone giving a little kid a chance. The movie also deals with Vardon's demons of coming from the wrong side of the tracks and trying to make it in an elitist's sport, which it was at the time for both Europeans and Americans.Shia LaBeouf is winsome as Ouimet as is Steven Dillane as Vardon. For those who don't know, Vardon was like the Tiger Woods of his day, maybe even more unbeatable. In the film, Vardon is pictured as a warm, nice guy; a genuine human being. the other major competitor, Ray (Stephen Marcus) is shown as somewhat of a brutish nasty guy. The fourth main character of this golf story might be the coolest person in the film: a fifth-grade boy who winds up being Ouimet's caddie in the Open. He (Josh Flitter) brings a lot of humor and charm to the movie.If all of this - a playoff with the huge underdog against two mighty pros and having come down to the last hole - were not true, you would think, ""Oh, man, this is so hokey. Who could believe this?"" That's what makes this true-life story fun to see finally captured on film. As with another sports film of 2005 - ""Cinderella Man"" - here is another excellent movie that got unjustly ignored when it came to awards. I guess nice films don't win awards.....just the hearts of their viewers."
784,tt0388980,9,"As a recreational golfer with some knowledge of the sport's history, I was pleased with Disney's sensitivity to the issues of class in golf in the early twentieth century. The movie depicted well the psychological battles that Harry Vardon fought within himself, from his childhood trauma of being evicted to his own inability to break that glass ceiling that prevents him from being accepted as an equal in English golf society. Likewise, the young Ouimet goes through his own class struggles, being a mere caddie in the eyes of the upper crust Americans who scoff at his attempts to rise above his standing. What I loved best, however, is how this theme of class is manifested in the characters of Ouimet's parents. His father is a working-class drone who sees the value of hard work but is intimidated by the upper class; his mother, however, recognizes her son's talent and desire and encourages him to pursue his dream of competing against those who think he is inferior.Finally, the golf scenes are well photographed. Although the course used in the movie was not the actual site of the historical tournament, the little liberties taken by Disney do not detract from the beauty of the film. There's one little Disney moment at the pool table; otherwise, the viewer does not really think Disney. The ending, as in ""Miracle,"" is not some Disney creation, but one that only human history could have written."
785,tt0388980,9,"I saw this film on September 1st, 2005 in Indianapolis. I am one of the judges for the Heartland Film Festival that screens films for their Truly Moving Picture Award. A Truly Moving Picture ""...explores the human journey by artistically expressing hope and respect for the positive values of life."" Heartland gave that award to this film.This is a story of golf in the early part of the 20th century. At that time, it was the game of upper class and rich ""gentlemen"", and working people could only participate by being caddies at country clubs. With this backdrop, this based-on-a-true-story unfolds with a young, working class boy who takes on the golf establishment and the greatest golfer in the world, Harry Vardon.And the story is inspirational. Against all odds, Francis Ouimet (played by Shia LaBeouf of ""Holes"") gets to compete against the greatest golfers of the U.S. and Great Britain at the 1913 U.S. Open. Francis is ill-prepared, and has a child for a caddy. (The caddy is hilarious and motivational and steals every scene he appears in.) But despite these handicaps, Francis displays courage, spirit, heroism, and humility at this world class event.And, we learn a lot about the early years of golf; for example, the use of small wooden clubs, the layout of the short holes, the manual scoreboard, the golfers swinging with pipes in their mouths, the terrible conditions of the greens and fairways, and the play not being canceled even in torrential rain.This film has stunning cinematography and art direction and editing. And with no big movie stars, the story is somehow more believable.This adds to the inventory of great sports movies in the vein of ""Miracle"" and ""Remember the Titans.""FYI - There is a Truly Moving Pictures web site where there is a listing of past winners going back 70 years."
786,tt0388980,7,"Actor turned director Bill Paxton follows up his promising debut, the Gothic-horror ""Frailty"", with this family friendly sports drama about the 1913 U.S. Open where a young American caddy rises from his humble background to play against his Bristish idol in what was dubbed as ""The Greatest Game Ever Played."" I'm no fan of golf, and these scrappy underdog sports flicks are a dime a dozen (most recently done to grand effect with ""Miracle"" and ""Cinderella Man""), but some how this film was enthralling all the same.The film starts with some creative opening credits (imagine a Disneyfied version of the animated opening credits of HBO's ""Carnivale"" and ""Rome""), but lumbers along slowly for its first by-the-numbers hour. Once the action moves to the U.S. Open things pick up very well. Paxton does a nice job and shows a knack for effective directorial flourishes (I loved the rain-soaked montage of the action on day two of the open) that propel the plot further or add some unexpected psychological depth to the proceedings. There's some compelling character development when the British Harry Vardon is haunted by images of the aristocrats in black suits and top hats who destroyed his family cottage as a child to make way for a golf course. He also does a good job of visually depicting what goes on in the players' heads under pressure. Golf, a painfully boring sport, is brought vividly alive here. Credit should also be given the set designers and costume department for creating an engaging period-piece atmosphere of London and Boston at the beginning of the twentieth century.You know how this is going to end not only because it's based on a true story but also because films in this genre follow the same template over and over, but Paxton puts on a better than average show and perhaps indicates more talent behind the camera than he ever had in front of it. Despite the formulaic nature, this is a nice and easy film to root for that deserves to find an audience."
788,tt0388980,8,"I saw this film in a sneak preview, and it is delightful. The cinematography is unusually creative, the acting is good, and the story is fabulous. If this movie does not do well, it won't be because it doesn't deserve to. Before this film, I didn't realize how charming Shia Lebouf could be. He does a marvelous, self-contained, job as the lead. There's something incredibly sweet about him, and it makes the movie even better. The other actors do a good job as well, and the film contains moments of really high suspense, more than one might expect from a movie about golf. Sports movies are a dime a dozen, but this one stands out. This is one I'd recommend to anyone."
793,tt0371606,8,"My son is four years old and I decided that his gift for the second day of Christmas would be his first trip to a movie theater. We scanned the list of titles now playing and Chicken little was pretty much the only option. Narnia or Cheaper by the dozen, for instance, are for much older kids. Mine found Shreck boring (he never had the patience to watch the whole movie on DVD). The same goes for Finding Nemo and pretty much every other movie I tried to make him watch, unless it was after some TV show. I was beginning to fear that we are doomed to watch nothing but Power Rangers forever. But Chicken Little did the trick. He watched it and loved it. In fact, he had the time of his life. He laughed, he screamed, he jumped, he covered his eyes and screamed again, and then he laughed some more.I can't say anything about myself, because I was to busy taking pictures of my kid watching his first movie to pay any attention to the screen, but my 4-year old rated this movie excellent. And I think his opinion is the only one that matters, because the movie is for him, and for other kids his age, not for grown-ups or teens. So please try to see it with the eyes of a little kid, and you might enjoy it better."
794,tt0371606,6,"Chicken Little (Zach Braff) claims that the sky is falling but it turns out later that it's not. Chicken Little is then mocked for the next year because he worried the town for no reason. A year passes by and this time the sky really is falling! So it's now up to Chicken Little to alert the town and prove to them that the aliens are really here! I was really looking forward to ""Chicken Little"" after seeing all the trailers but this movie doesn't live up to the hype and falls short. The characters are likable so it's not the characters that make this movie not live up to expectation but rather its story and running time.The movie clocks in at a measly 77 minutes, which as many know is not nearly long enough for a movie. These days a movie should run no less than 90 mins and this film runs 13 minutes less than that. The whole problem is the story here, it starts off promising but then when the sky really does start to fall, the film feels rushed. The story definitely needed some brushing up on and I fear now for Disney that without Pixar they may really be in trouble. The problem was ""Chicken Little"" had so much potential and a great marketing campaign but the writers didn't pay any detail to the story to help the film live up to it's expectations.Disney thinks that hand drawn animation is done for but the problem isn't hand drawn animation, it's the fact that the better stories are going to computer animated films. That is ""Chicken Little's"" problem. The film is computer animation but it still doesn't have a great story and therefore critics panned it. If someone hand drew ""Finding Nemo"" with the great and unique story it had, it probably would have done just as good as it did being computer animated. Disney really needs to concentrate more on its stories rather then its animation.Now it sounds like I am beating up on ""Chicken Little"" but I don't mean too that much. I actually enjoyed the film but I expected more from it. I wanted a longer film; I wanted a more polished story. I just wanted more from this film in general and like I said the film fell short because the movie just relied too much on its animation and not enough on it's story.Another problem was that the jokes aren't very fresh and there aren't enough jokes in the script that adults can enjoy as well as their kids. The characters are the best part of the movie especially Runt of the litter voiced by Steve Zahn, Abby Mallard voiced by Joan Cusack and of course Chicken Little himself. The voice talent was great, they just needed a better story to help move the film along better.In the end, ""Chicken Little"" is disappointing. It's a decent film that could have been great only if Disney concentrated more on its story rather than on its marketing. The movie on the whole isn't bad, it just isn't great. The characters, voice talent and some of the jokes save the movie from really sinking. This movie is sure to amuse the little ones but once you get past the age of 13, you may not find the film overly amusing. The shame is that movies like ""Corpse Bride"" and ""Wallace and Gromit"" which were released into theaters a few weeks ago are far more enjoyable then ""Chicken Little"" and contain things that both adults and children alike can enjoy like their stories. ""Chicken Little"" is worth a matinée ticket at the multiplex but not worth full price. If you have kids, take them they will love it even though you may not enjoy it as much as its clever marketing makes you believe.MovieManMenzel's final rating for Chicken Little is a 6/10. It's decent but had the potential to be so much more!"
795,tt0371606,6,"Reviewing ""Robots,"" ""The New York Times"" opined that when it comes to animation there's Pixar, there's Japan, and there's everyone else (it should be noted that not all Japanese cartoons are good - ""Shin Chan,"" anyone? - but you see A.O. Scott's point). ""Chicken Little"" definitely falls into the ""anywhere else"" camp, but while it won't siphon away fans from John Lasseter or Nick Park - especially since Disney's delayed its UK release for a few months, the way they did with ""Sky High"" (but not ""Herbie: Fully Loaded,"" I notice. Idiots) - it's not DreamWorks-mediocre either.The House of Mouse's first attempt at computer animated movies without Pixar was the skilfully made but hollow ""Dinosaur""; this one is under the auspices of the team behind the wonderful ""The Emperor's New Groove,"" and while it doesn't have that cartoon's spirit it still has some virtues of its own. More deliberately cartoonish in its look and feel than many recent features, it's also probably a little too sentimental for some tastes - an awful lot of the movie involves our feathered hero wanting not only to redeem himself for the whole ""the sky is falling"" farrago but also to open up two-way communication with his single dad, with all the Family Issues that implies. Fortunately it never really swamps the movie, with the family message never overriding the main intent, i.e. to entertain.Unlike the inexplicably hugely successful ""Madagascar,"" it doesn't drag and the voice cast (Zach Braff, Garry Marshall, Joan Cusack, et al) doesn't get in the way of the movie's effect; it relies a little too much on popular culture references and songs for its effect (particularly in the opening - that works in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" in live action - and in the case of Runt of the Litter, the show-tune-loving pig voiced by Steve Zahn), but it's a colourful, charming little movie that thankfully ends well before it has a chance to wear out its welcome, and it's nice to have a movie with a message that doesn't try to ram it down your throat. There are worse Disney movies that could have been dedicated to veteran animator Joe Grant.And if nothing else, I defy anyone to find another movie that has the voices of Don Knotts and Patrick Stewart joining in on ""Don't Go Breaking My Heart"" over the credits..."
796,tt0371606,1,"I'm not going to write a synopsis of the movie since everyone else has done that and besides I want you to go check it out for yourself. If you love animation please do not pay attention to the negative posts here. The movie was pure fun with a few sentimental moments here and there. I think people nowadays have forgotten that movies are there for mostly entertainment purposes. When you can't even enjoy a fun family flick like ""Chicken Little"" anymore you know something's wrong. Or maybe people are too busy comparing it to Pixar to give it a real chance. who knows? The movie was FUN. I've seen it twice already and both times the audience enjoyed it and laughed throughout the movie. So for those of you who are genuinely interested in the movie, go read all of the positive posts and you can feel how excitable the movie made many folks feel. It definitely lifted my spirits. The voice talent for ""Chicken Little"" was dead on. i thought it would be weird having an adult male's voice for a little tyke such as C. Little, but it works perfectly here. I also thought the character Runt would be annoying, but he turned out to bring many of the laughs within the theater. I definitely recommend this film to those who are fans of the animated film genre!"
797,tt0371606,1,"This is without a split second of hesitation the worst movie I have ever seen. I actually cried through large parts of it due to the agony of watching it.Moral of the first 60 minutes of the story: if you are not good at sports then you are a bad person that nobody likes, not even your own parents, and that is just what you deserve. And if you are being bullied for not being good at sports then do not expect any help from adults, because you deserve that as well.After 60 minutes the movie turns info a cartoon version of War of the Worlds with aliens in giant octopus vessels terrorizing the town.The only thing I am grateful for is that I watched this on TV and not on cinema—that way I only wasted time and not money."
798,tt0371606,3,"When I first saw the trailer for this movie I was dying to see it, I didn't get around to it though until I was at a friends house a while back. I couldn't get myself to watch passed the aliens first invasion. The beginning is amazingly well done, although completely unrealisitc, but i mean its an animation movie and that's the genius of it. Then I finally sat down and watched this movie and I quickly found out that it wasn't worth the hour or so of my time. It seemed rushed at the end and wasn't funny at all. I kept on thinking, what will they do for an ending, and then it was over so I was kind of disappointed. It's good for the younger audience, but not for a teenager like myself."
799,tt0371606,1,"Ready for a lot of political correctness? Than you must watch Chicken Little. Good cartoons teach good lessons effortlessly. Usually, a good story develops as the main theme slowly moves into focus. Instead, this movie kept advertising itself during the movie. Watch it for your self. Here's the spoiler: the world is saved, not by Chicken Little, but because he can finally communicate openly with his dad- really? Here's why The Incredibles made money: it avoided political correctness (in fact being un-politically correct is the new ""raw, edgy, straddles the line perfectly""), it respects real heroes (not accidental ones), it doesn't pander to the insignificant moviegoers, and it was cut well (Chicken Little's school life was wholly insignificant to the movie)."
800,tt0363771,1,"The audience at this afternoon's preview screening of The Lion, The Witch & The Wardrobe, at New York's AMC 25 theater in Times Square, broke out in spontaneous applause at least three or four times. It seems that director Andrew Adamson has brought a thaw to normally-jaded New Yorkers as well as to the 100-year winter of Narnia. The movie pulls the viewer into the story right from the opening scenes of war-ravaged England, where siblings Lucy, Susan, Peter and Edmund (wonderful performances by all) are sent from their homes to the relative safety of 'the professor's' country estate where, during a game of hide-and-go-seek, young Lucy hides in the wardrobe only to discover the passage to the land of Narnia. From this point, the multi-layered story of betrayal, courage, sacrifice, redemption and hope unfolds into a briskly paced 2 hour and ten minute adventure that leaves the viewer emotionally charged and thoroughly entertained. The musical score is appropriately stirring and moody. The computer generated creatures are sophisticated to the point where the technology disappears and you begin to accept the performance, and not the special effect! This brings us to Aslan - if the talking lion didn't work, the movie would fold in on itself and go away. Aslan works,however, and works very well. Voiced by Liam Neeson, Alsan is both believable as a 'literal' lion and as Aslan, talking lion, King of Narnia. Aslan's face is expressive and noble, and Neeson's voice acting has strength and dignity. This film succeeds on so many levels, it would be possible to discuss it in many different veins: the direction, the story's surface-level themes, the theological possibilities, the drama, the fantasy, the adventure.... Yes - it's an action film, a dramatic film, a fantasy, a somewhat-dark (yet hopeful) fairy-tale. It has humorous moments and frightening moments, like most truly great 'family' films always seem to have. The bottom line is, this is a film that will leave you the better for having seen it. There's much to reflect on and much to simply enjoy - there's certainly enough to keep you thinking for a while, and that's always a good thing. Aslan, indeed, is on the move!"
801,tt0363771,8,"To sum things up: I loved this movie.I had been waiting for it ever since it was announced, so of course I couldn't pass up the chance to see a press preview this morning. And, while there were some definite weaknesses (mostly in the quality of the animations), overall I was completely convinced. Naturally it did not coincide 100% with my own vision of Narnia visually, but emotionally it rang absolutely true, choking me up several times and really touching me. I walked out of the theatre with a warm, contented feeling - just like I feel every time I read C.S. Lewis' book! The stand-out performance was definitely Tilda Swinton's as the White Witch, but I liked all actors/voices, from cute little Lucy (newcomer Georgie Henley) to majestic Aslan (Liam Neeson). I thought the children did a great job, considering their relative inexperience and the amount of blue screen work involved.Tip: Stay seated through the actor credits - afterwards there's another small scene."
802,tt0363771,1,"The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe should go down in the history books right up there with the likes of Lord of the Rings. I went to see it expecting a very good movie. I came out stunned by the magnitude of the picture. Everything about it is so well done, the casting, the scenery, the score. Lord of the Rings is the only thing I can think of to compare it to. I experienced the same overwhelming sense of awe watching both of these phenomenal pictures. The CG images are very good, though not quite as startlingly realistic as those in LOTR. I cannot find fault with the casting in any way.Though the voice of Liam Neeson is not as I would have imagined a lion's at first, it is smooth, confident, and effective. Aslan is given the presence so essential to the heart of the story. I must comment on the performance of James McAvoy as Mr. Tumnus, which I believe was the best in the film. Lucy was adorable, and surprisingly convincing, and Peter was given a very firm performance. I was a little nervous about how Edmund would turn out, but I needn't have worried; those large, startlingly dark eyes are perfect for the change from traitor to hero. I commend the directors of the movie on their strict adherence to the book. Narnia isn't just ""based"" on the book. It IS the book. The scope, depth, and wonder of Lewis's world have been captured in a timeless manner that should be cherished for all ages. This is a movie for everyone, at a level for children to understand, yet with a fast plot and exciting battle sequences that will keep anyone interested. The last battle scene especially is as touching as any I have ever seen, including those in LOTR, putting tears in my eyes even while my heart soared. Go see Narnia for an exciting, well-done film, and a timeless message that our world so desperately needs.Ten stars!!"
804,tt0385726,7,"In 1966, a coach of a girl's basketball team comes to Texas Western College and recruits seven black players to lead them to the top.Right from the trailers and the posters, you probably know how ""Glory Road"" is gonna go: an underdog NCAA basketball team must face great odds to win the championship. It's a sports movie based from true events (read: based) with a Hollywood tag plastered over its forehead that features reluctant heroes overcoming their problems and giving it all for the game. Nonetheless, the movie achieves more than that. While this Jerry Bruckheimer-produced Disney movie plot is typical (remember the Titans?), the underlying socio-political theme effectively presents the ills of racism - a problem with no easy way out of (ask Paul Haggis). The key characters of the game are dealing with discrimination and the only way they can get back is to win. Of course, a little research told me that some of the details about the real events were changed for cinematic purposes. It's completely fine by me as long as the end product justifies the means. And boy it does. The performances are also good. Josh Lucas gives a terrific performance as Don Haskins, the head coach of the team that featured the first all-black starting lineup in US NCAA history.""Glory Road"" is a formulaic yet an enjoyable film. It's a movie that gives itself away as soon as one character says ""I want to play, Coach!"" Still it has charm and excitement that comes from seeing it for what it is. It's predictable, yeah, but it's not much different from seeing a replay of a game where your favorite team won."
805,tt0385726,7,"""Glory Road"" tells the true story of Don Haskins, the basketball coach for Western Texas College, who in the mid 1960's, broke the color barrier in the NCAA by being the first to feature a majority of black players on his team. The movie chronicles the obstacles he and his players faced, as well as their ultimate triumph when the team won the national championship in 1966.""Glory Road"" worships at the altar of just about every underdog-sports-movie cliché one can imagine, yet the viewer can't help getting caught up in its story anyway. The scenes in the first half of the movie definitely have a familiar ring to them, as we see the coach first alienating his players with his hardnosed tactics, then winning them over by building comradeship and showing them how much they can accomplish when they work together as a team rather than as individuals. However, as with ""Remember the Titans,"" ""Glory Road"" is more interested in examining the social background of its time period than in merely telling yet another sports-oriented David and Goliath tale. The second half of the film concentrates more on the overt racism the team members face and the surprising courage they and their coach demonstrate in confronting it (could this really be set a mere 40 years ago?). The young actors are uniformly excellent, but it is Josh Lucas as Coach Haskins who delivers the powerhouse performance here. And director James Gartner manages to keep the film moving at a fast clip, never allowing it to get bogged down in message-mongering or overt preachiness.Almost in spite of itself, ""Glory Road"" turns into a genuinely inspiring story about courage and determination in the face of societal pressure and incalculable odds. And that's pretty much what sports stories, familiar though they might be, are really all about."
806,tt0436595,7,"I was fortunate enough to see the first public premier of this IMAX movie given to Lockheed-Martin Employees. The public reception was warm but not overwhelming. The images of Mars and the Rocket Launch were magnificent and the animated segments were indistinguishable from the filmed segments, very accurately using the photographs sent by the Rovers to create the landscapes. One note about a sequence that made many in the theater groan - THERE IS NO SOUND IN SPACE!!!!! Much of the movie consisted of often young enthusiastic engineers telling us how impossible the task was and (indirectly) how brilliant they must be. I do not belittle the accomplishment, it is awesome to be sure, but this standard Mantra we get with every film depicting a technological accomplishment is getting repetitious. On the other hand, I understand the wall NASA is up against every day to get and keep funding for these very important programs, so any salesmanship is forgiven. It is also, I suppose, important for the general layman to understand why these programs are so difficult to pull off so they can truly appreciate the success. I was impressed by the humor and humbleness that the engineers displayed in the face of test failures. This is an interesting, and at times, visually striking documentary, definitely worth seeing. Take the kids, they'll be wide eyed as the public gets its first truly satisfying look at the red planet."
807,tt0436595,8,"I went to this at the IMAX today and I found my 30 minute drive well worth the trouble. Although a short documentary, it is an extremely informative one.Although there seems to be some license given to the sound of the film, it creates a stunning aura to the scenes both on Mars and in Space. The film is actually quite dramatic. Kids will find themselves staring saucer-eyed at the visuals as well as the soothing and informative narration given by an all too familiar voice that I cannot place.I recommend this film and give it a high rating due to the fact that it has accomplished something I value most in Documentories- Making Learning fun. Watching children and adults alike leave the theater chatting animatedly about the ""possibilities of life"" in the universe made me beam happily through the rest of the museum."
808,tt0436595,8,"Short documentary, and just good enough to keep the attention of young viewers... great action sequences and as mentioned, the animation from live footage is nearly indistinguishable... the NASA experience shared here both in actual footage and staff interviews makes for great enjoyment for any space buff... well worth seeing as an IMAX candidate! I suppose the only drawback is no green men or any Hollywood fantasies here, you have to actually use your mind to imagine the possibilities of what's out there, given the tidbits of evidence about water and rock material collected from the mission... should be enough for any mortal man, but don't go in expecting to see Tom Cruise battle any aliens. :)"
822,tt0397313,8,"My wife and I went to go this flick in the theater and I would say we were the only folks there without children. We went because we are the proud owners of two huskies ourselves. I urge anyone that is interested in dogs, animals, huskies, Antarctica, whatever, to see this movie. I must say for a Disney movie, it's not as childish as one may think, and there are definitely a few tear-jerking parts for different reasons. I have already noticed the desire growing amongst folks to have huskies in the past year or so, and I bet this movie will only positively influence that. Huskies can be a handful, but they are one of the coolest/smartest breeds you'll ever encounter. I just hope folks will go to Husky Rescue groups, before shelling out hundreds of dollars for breeders. Minor adjustments I would have made are focusing a little more on the dogs survival and less on Paul Walker's mission to get funding. Also, the dogs definitely did not not ""talk"" as much as our two huskies do : )"
809,tt0436595,6,"This incredible, true science story was made and released on Imax, but I saw it on DVD. It is straightforward and, while interesting, it has limited entertainment value for those with little interest in the Mars Rover project. It is short and I felt that more could have been included and an effort could have been made to use more of a 'storytelling' approach. As well, writer/director/narrator George Butler could have used celebrities or strong personalities among the mission team, to create more interest. his choice, however, was to create a simple documentary, which is fine for space race fans, but of limited interest to others.The feature tells the story of NASA's Mars Rover mission, which saw the construction of two incredibly complex robotic vehicles (The total technology involved in the rovers exceeds the brain capacity of any one person - best useless fact of the film) named 'Spirit' and 'Opportunity' and sent them to the surface of Mars, where they landed successfully in the summer of 2003. There is extensive footage of the surface of Mars, where both carefully accurate CGI and actual Rover footage, is used to give the viewer a nice visit to another world. Amazingly, the planned mission of 90 days has now gone on for over four years and continues to this day. They don't tell you that in the film. I became curious and looked it up for you guys.This documentary is an excellent choice for educators and for those with an interest in the space program. Many others, who are less academically curious will not enjoy it and should steer clear. If it is your cup of tea, then check out the special features, as well. They share a lot more interesting information.This work was first posted on realmoviereview.com"
810,tt0436595,9,"I saw this at an Imax in LA last week - I'm still in awe. Maybe the previous commenter was a rocket scientist himself, but for me, the hurdles these people had to accomplish in the time they did, and the unbelievable success they had is something that made me proud to be an American when I left the theater. The visual aspects of the film left me holding my breath at times. And the story - it was the same story we've all seen 100 times - a small group of people working together to achieve the impossible. Only this time, the story is true, the people are real and the goal is the advancement of humanity. Something we can all be proud of in a time when there are not that many things that we should be proud of. Take everyone you can drag with you - there isn't anyone who won't be moved by the vistas of a distant planet sent here by a couple tiny robots built by a small group of men and women from the planet Earth who had a dream. Why a 9 instead of a 10? It ended too soon."
811,tt0436595,6,"I was disappointed. With all the pictures sent back by the rovers even before the movie had to cut and run, the film devotes only a couple of minutes to these. The landing doesn't even occur until the halfway point (20 minutes), and the first pictures from the rovers at 26 minutes. Meanwhile, more of the limited (40 minutes) time is devoted to talking heads than to anything else. There are CGI fly-overs of Mars when there could have been actual photos.The interviews, CGI flyovers, and simulations of the rovers are very good stuff -- accurate and informative -- and would have been excellent in a 2- or 3-hour film. The problem is the emphasis, which needed to be ""what we saw on Mars"". Forty minutes didn't give time for all the rest. This is the rare documentary which would have been much better expanded. Keep all the good stuff, add even more about the difficulties of getting to Mars (there's brief mentions of past failures, and these are fascinating stories of their own), and add a lot more about the scientific goals and successes, and a great deal more photographs sent back from the rovers, and a lot more explanations of what is seen in these photos. It's as though the makers assumed viewers were only interested in the people behind the mission, and not the mission itself.Then there's the emphasis on water, life, and preparation for manned visits. This does not accurately represent the mission. While water and life detection was part of it, the mission was a lot more. And the idea of manned visits to Mars is a pipe dream, driven by emotions and politics, not science. The film makers would have served us better by emphasizing the excitement in the exploration by proxy, rather than viewing it as merely a preparation for manned flight.The film does prove, once again, that Philip Glass can write astoundingly good film music.There's a huge need to convey the enormous excitement in the actual unmanned missions, to Mars and to the other planets. This documentary chose instead to keep the blinders on, emphasizing what's believed to be already exciting to humans.Note that I only saw this on a home screen, not IMAX. I'm sure some parts would have been much more impressive on IMAX. But that's all the more reason to upend the emphases. Who wants to go into an IMAX theater, for only 40 minutes, and watch talking heads?"
812,tt0436595,7,"On January 4, 2004 Sean O'Keefe, Director of NASA, announced the ""Spirit"" had landed. Three years earlier the scientists and researchers at NASA Jet Prepulsion were assigned to build two identical robotic rovers to send to Mars and feed data back to Earth. The two rovers were named ""Spirit"" and ""Opportunity"", which were successful in presenting a brand new view of what Mars is really like...and actually proving at one time there was water on the mysterious planet. This 40 minute documentary is directed and narrated by George Butler. Shot in IMAX and with life-like animation, ROVING MARS answers decades old curiosity about the soil and terrain of Earth's closest planetary neighbor. You just wish you had a longer glimpse. A wonderful tool for classrooms."
813,tt0436595,7,"This had the _opportunity_ to be a great documentary. It started with less of the crappy motivational speeches and some bits of actual science. They showed the construction phases of the two rovers that went on Mars and the animations were great.I expected this to turn into a detailed log of the travels of the two rovers and the emotions involved and the science and engineering decisions that were made. But the film ended abruptly, after only 38 minutes. The rovers landed and finished their mission in less than 10 minutes of film time.What was a great concept and a refreshing presentation style ended up in mediocrity. And what was Paul Newman doing narrating the beginning of the film? God, he sounded old."
814,tt0436595,4,"""Roving Mars"" is a 40-minute documentary short film produced by Disney and written and directed by experienced documentary filmmaker George Butler (""Punping Iron""). The question how much you will enjoy this one here all comes down do how much you like science, astronomy and exploration films. I myself am not too big on all these subjects, so I did not enjoy it too much. I also believe that people have intruded enough in areas where they have no business being with, which is why I cannot share the scientists' joy in this film when they get the robot to Mars and receive a signal. The narrator here is Oscar winner Paul Newman in one of his final works as a (voice) actor. All in all, I give this one a negative verdict as I did never really feel entertained. But maybe you will if you are more into this kind of films."
815,tt0397313,9,"The acting in this movie is weak. Now that I got that out of the way, let me tell you why this film is worth watching: the outdoor photography and the dogs. This movie contains some of the most impressive outdoor cinematography that one can hope or expect to see in a Hollywood movie. This movie shows the awesome and forbidding beauty of icebergs, ice flows and glacier-covered mountains. Compared to these magnificent edifices of nature, man is rendered almost utterly insignificant, a mere dot in a wilderness of ice that is almost endless. Indeed, the scenery is spectacular. That's one interesting part of the movie. But the main part of the movie are the dogs - eight of them. This movie offers a wonderful story about eight brave and stalwart creatures that are determined to survive in the polar wilderness. Having been abandoned by their owner, the dogs must fend for themselves, and they do so, by staying together, working as a team, looking out for each other and caring for each other. They set an example for us humans to follow. That's why this is a movie that's not about us, but about those wonderful dogs."
816,tt0397313,1,"Just getting back from seeing 8 below, i am completely blown away by  several elements.  Firstly, right away you get glimpes of STUNNING scenery that continue  throughout the whole film. Beautiful artic landscapes frame the main  story line and on the big screen, it really takes your breath away.  The movie also is really able to give anyone an idea of what its like  to be in the artic, and really gave a clear picture of what being an  explorer was like. This added to the appeal of the movie, because its  not something most of us get to experience.   Although the acting has been in some cases been criticized, I believe  the actors fulfilled their purpose within the movie. They were able to  play their roles, without distracting from the dogs, which of course,  is the most important part. Paul Walker clearly comes across as a  strong animal lover, and displays this well. He becomes relatable to  any animal lovers, who will utimatly love this movie. As for the  others, the fulfilled their jobs, which is what matters. The character  of ""Cooper"" gave great comic relief, and ""Katie"" acted out the  predicable love story line well.  But of course, the most important aspect of this movie was the dogs. I  can hardly even begin to describe what a wonderful job they did. The  tricks preformed (as a dog lover and trainer) were some with great  difficulty. Ultimately, the way the dogs interact with each other and  are so compassionate, you really connect with them. The only way to  really experience this is to GO. the movie is AMAZING and a wonderful  family film. Although a part or two may be slightly scary, its still an  amazing picture for ALL to enjoy, it completely blew all of us a way."
817,tt0397313,8,"I went begrudgingly to see this film with my daughter. It was not on my list of films to see but she insisted. Knowing that it was a Disney product only made me dread it more. The schlock they try to pass off as good films these days is ridiculous. The only up-side I could see was the director, Frank Marshall. He has produced some of my favorite films. Let's see what he can do behind the camera.Pleasantly surprised I think is a good term for my reaction. Although the film was about 20 minutes too long, it did sustain the action and drama all the way through. I knew the basics of the story: a team at a base in Antartica must evacuate and cannot take the sled dogs with them. Winter sets in and the dogs are forced to survive on their own in the brutal cold for months.The dogs are very entertaining and their scenes with the science team are warm and amusing, even thrilling. Where I expected the film to fail was after the humans and dogs separate. Amazingly though, this is where the Mr. Marshall seemed to kick it into gear. Watching the opposing scenes unfold of the guilt-ridden Paul Walker frantically trying to find anyone to help him get back down to the Antartic, interlaced with the Huskies who are struggling through the rough winter, scrounging for food and defending each other from predators, was very emotional.While the film is a grade A survival pic, I hadn't expected it to be such a tear-jerker. Be forewarned. Although the human performances (Paul Walker, Bruce Greenwood and the necessary romantic lead, Moon Bloodgood) were mediocre at best, the canine actors really do steal your heart.No Oscar material here, but as far as family films go these days, this one is above par. Grade: B"
818,tt0397313,1,"Where do I start? Throughout the movie I couldn't help think about the great dog training. The Huskies were all wonderful and the stars of the movie. I realize that Eight Below is inspired by a true story, but the movie is well written and the story hands together from beginning to end. By the way, my wife and I have two Huskies. We were both teary eyed through much of the movie as were other movie goers. But you don't have to have Huskies or dogs as pets to enjoy this movie. No gratuitous sex or violence, no profanity, but a heart tugging story of survival against all odds. The scenery was beautiful to experience on the big screen, the acting is good and this is a great movie for the entire family. I can't wait to see the movie again. It's a wonderful, clean, wholesome family movie."
819,tt0397313,1,Beautifully orchestrated spin off of the movie Antartica which was done in 1983. I thought the photography was great and the terrain that was shown for the locations is much like the Antarctic.What made the movie extra special for me was the fact that I wintered over in the Antarctic in 1958 and was there when the Japanese came back to the Showa Base and found the 2 dogs that had survived the past 12 months. Very incredible and heartwarming story. There is a monument to the dog team in the form of statues at the base of the Tokyo Tower to honor them. I was fortunate to see it in 1992.The dogs in Eight Below were so well trained and you form an immediate bond with them. The movie can be seen and enjoyed by all ages. A must have for my film library.
820,tt0397313,8,"Believe it or not I took my 22 month old granddaughter to see this movie while my older children were viewing another movie, I was so happy when she spent the entire 120 minutes engrossed in this film! I found myself in awe of the filmmakers who captured such beautiful pictures. The dogs were wonderful and the movie inspired me to research the true story. Which I found out actually happened in 1958 and they were Japanese explorers. The dogs who survived are actually heroes in Japan with statues to commend them! Even though I hate the cold...a trip there to see the beauty would be on my list if I were rich! Take a Kleenex or two because this move is sure to it draw a few tears. Excellent film for dog lovers, adventurers, dreamers or just those who love the beauty in nature!"
821,tt0397313,1,"This film is one that I found I could sit back and enjoy the scenery, the stark beauty of the Antartic, and the personalities of the dogs and humans.I do wolf education with my husky-wolf mix and it was exciting to see the dogs use their strong senses to survive in the harsh land. Their loyalty to the family mirrored that of a wild wolf pack and showed where the intelligence of domestic dogs was honed and refined in the long ago battles of survival.Huskies and Malemutes look at home in that element because they were bred to work and survive in like conditions. These two near primitives could really do what these actors did and survive. It was refreshing to me to see humans show the same dedication and love for the dogs that dogs give to their human family members every day. It would be hard for actors to really be able to show all that those of us who treasure our dogs would feel if we had to leave them behind but he did a credible job.I am glad to have been able to see this movie and I enjoyed it every bit as much as I did IRON WILL and his huskies."
823,tt0397313,9,"I am a huge dog freak, so I was looking forward to this movie already to begin with. But I didn't expect it to be so touching. it's not just about sled dogs in Antartica, it's about survival, and the bond a person has with their dogs.While the actors did well in the movie, the best performances in the movie came from the dogs, hands down. I know that makes me sound pretty crazy, but when you see this movie, you know it's true. This is an awesome movie for all ages. I went to go see it with my 20 and 30 year old friends, and this is now one of their favorite movies of all time (besides Dirty Dancing). I say this is a great movie for the whole family!"
824,tt0397313,8,"The eight stars is for the incredible dogs, and the strong bond Jerry Shepherd (Paul Walker) holds with them (as well as for both commentaries on the DVD, which holds some very cool info about the dogs, and interesting facts, such as to why One's breath does not show in below zero weather, like so many tend to believe it should). They actually deserve the highest of all star ratings, but I can not even think to give this movie ten stars for all the rest of it. The rest of it deserves less than zero! This movie pulled, ripped, and shredded all my heart strings and left me absolutely drained. The only true heart through this movie was from the dogs and Jerry. No one else cared enough or tried enough, which was made abundantly clear from the very start, when they first chose to take the equipment out before the dogs, thus beginning the whole tragedy in motion. This mentality throughout the film made Jerry's declaration to his girlfriend, near the end, that he owed her for always understanding how important getting back to the dogs was, very confusing to me. It seemed that she always had this sly smile on her face, even in the beginning when giving condolences over having to leave the dogs, she always seemed to be having a happy glow on her... really disconcerting. Just felt like, ""So sorry, so sad, but must move on now!"" If the intention of her character was to be understanding throughout the movie, her part was sorely lacking. At best, she came off as patronizing and just barely patient through his worrying so much over something that she made very clear should be let go of, even though the dogs were at that very moment starving, lost, lonely, and dying. It wasn't a year later... or even six months yet... but this was her attitude at the beginning until they finally decided to go back. Did she not get that you don't get past something WHILE IT IS STILL HAPPENING???!!! Only after you understand that it is over, truly done with, do you even start to think about the journey of learning to live with it. But out of sight out of mind, right?!!! So, that scene, and the fact that no one ever actually apologized, or made some motion that they were responsible with their lack of previous action, made me somewhat sick at heart. Even if they couldn't go back through winter due to the impossible nature of weather or what have you, they could have -- should have! -- been a much better support system (or even any kind of support system at all!!!) to Jerry. Even when the doc finally gave in way later, it felt like he was inching his way to it, as if through guilt alone, begrudgingly doing Jerry and the dogs a FAVOR instead of finally understanding that HE OWED THEM ALL and was doing what he should have done from the start, saving them all -- as he should have Dewey and Old Jack -- as they had saved him time and again. The fact is that even if this movie wasn't based on a true story it would irk me and make my heart ache... but the sad truth is that not only was there one dog (Old Jack) that died through starvation, alone and immobile in the snow... but in real life, there were actually SEVEN -- and SIX more unaccounted for!!! In real life there were 15 dogs and only two known to have survived. So, I don't even get the comfort of, ""Well, at least this was just a movie"". Needless to say, this is the movie that finally outdid the one other movie that ripped my heart to shreds as a little girl -- Old Yeller -- but at least that one was truly ""just a movie"". So, yes, this movie is a spectacular viewing, the dogs are beyond awesome, Paul Walker is fantastic, a true hero (An avid dog lover in real life, as well!), with a considerable joyous relief in the end for the dogs that did survive... but I just can't get past the absolutely avoidable TRAGIC deaths of those other loyal, loving, trusting dogs... betrayed... and the fact that the ones that did survive were no doubt scarred for life. So many are heralding this movie as a human bonding, growing thing. While I do say that it is a lesson of the true love and loyalty that dog holds for man, and that man should hold for dog... for the rest of it, it's a painful reminder of all the dogs left behind (ex: The heroic Vietnam war dogs; the K-9 Katrina victims; the no longer interested family leaving their pup in the woods), an acknowledgment of the ungratefulness and insufferable selfishness of so many out there, and the heartbreaking destruction that too often comes from it. **View this movie so to let the haunting images fill you, and then never allow such a horrific thing to happen again. NO ANIMAL LEFT BEHIND! These dogs story needs to be told, so that their deaths are never, ever in vain and such tragedy is never allowed to ever happen again. **For those that are looking to buy the original movie that this one is based on, you can often find used copies of the video at Amazon.com. If it's not there when you look, keep checking -- under both of its titles ""Antarctica"" and ""Nankyoku monogatari"" (meaning ""The South Pole Story"")... It goes in and out. It's also been seen in ebay."
825,tt0393735,7,"I took my 12 year old grandson to see it and he was rolling on the floor for most of the film. I was surprised that it was actually funny,much more surprise than I was prepared for. This is a funny movie for those preteens and early teens as they seem to really enjoy it. Sure it is not full of high tech special effects and should never be compared to the Matrix, but it is a Disney! movie --- get it... a Disney movie. Take that into consideration ... how many Disney movies achieve high ratings anyway, other than the classics? This is a fun movie. I saw the original and it was funny too. Remember way back when everything was black and white and not color? The special effects in this movie are not very high tech and some of the metamorphosis takes place when you do not see it, so do not expect ""the wolf-man"" changes to be shown, nope, one shot he is a man, the next he is a dog.

This is not cinema verité. People give ""What Women Want"" with Mel Gibson a much higher rating, but that's just as daft.There are plenty of set-piece chases, as you would expect with a storyline about dogs.

Bit samey with the oldest child a teenage daughter who wears different clothes and wants to be rebellious...father works a lot and isn't the most committed father..mother who seems to do it all and has had enough and then the younger son who just seems to want to do his own thing but hasn't the nerve to say it.

The movie was not funny and it was quite dull. I know it's just a harmless family film but did it have to be so boring and humorless? Of course it didn't. I always thought family movies were supposed to entertain the entire family not just one age group of the family.

But I did see Lon Chaney play The Wolfman, and a dozen other werewolf movies. This is a G-rated version of the same mythology, and it resonates for me as an adult, but flies over the head of my youngster.

There are a few good jokes in there that would would spark a chuckle from the 'elders', and some of Tim Allen's dog-ish impressions might make you laugh but it will get old.The movie starts off like a mysterious Jackie Chan movie, set in Tibet. We are shown a temple where a sheep dog sits praying with the rest of the monks, but a foul plot is afoot: the military has been sent to kidnap this dog, which has been alive for more than 300 years. The evil Dr. Kozak (Robert Downey Jr.) wants to market a ""fountain of youth"" from the dogs DNA.Meanwhile, Dave Douglas (Tim Allen), a Washington D.A., is having an average American lifestyle. His kids know that he doesn't get them, and his wife is starting to realize that she is losing her husband to his job. When the 300 year old shaggy dog escapes the test lab and bites Douglas,he transforms into a dog at night, and has many dog-like tendencies throughout the day.Often, jokes are repeated throughout the movie, yet don't receive a ""running-joke"" label, but become annoying. However, Tim Allen's thoughts while a dog (""I don't know why I never tried this running on four legs thing before!"") are quite cute. All in all, it's like ""Good Boy"" with a slightly different story."

Unfortunately, all he has produced are animal mutations such as a king cobra-canine with a tail, a dog-frog that barks, and other mutations that are part dog. The sheepdog escapes the lab and is rescued by Carly Douglas (Zena Grey), who takes him home. Deputy District Attorney Dave Douglas (Tim Allen) is prosecuting Carly's teacher for the firebombing of Dr. Kozak's lab. Dave hates dogs, and after he is bitten by the sheepdog, the dog is sent to the pound. The dog has injected Dave with some of his DNA cells, and Dave begins to have canine urges and eventually, becomes a sheepdog. Dave learns the truth about his family and the drug company as a dog.(My Comment) This is a cute movie that you can take your children to. There are several funny scenes like the bathroom and park scenes that are just hilarious. I think they wasted their money on the CG effects on the cat chasing scene. If you look at the Shaggy Dog poster, you will see Tim Allen's eerie eyes. I enjoyed this movie, and you must remember that this is only a movie, and don't take the plot too seriously.

Breathtaking special effects, and fabulous scenery. All in all, a great film. It must be viewed in the theater. It is better than Dead Man's Chest, but I still like the overall story line of Curse of the Blach Pearl better. As always, be sure to stick around after the credits for an extra scene.

She even explained the DNA cloning technology in such a way that demonstrated just how much craft when into the screenplay -- ""make it understandable to a kid under 12"" -- even though the pseudo science of the plot often distracted my adult mind.I never saw the original flick with Fred MacMurray. But I did see Lon Chaney play The Wolfman, and a dozen other werewolf movies. This is a G-rated version of the same mythology, and it resonates for me as an adult, but flies over the head of my youngster. ""The Shaggy Dog"" works on two distinct levels while satisfying both audiences -- I only wish all family movies were this good."
842,tt0393735,1,"OK, you know what let's get to the chase: ITS AWFUL!!!!!! The Shaggy Dog was obviously targeted for kids, and you know what? I'm not sure if they liked it! This is a pitiful movie and I can't believe some people paid money to see this! (Don't worry, I got free tickets.) This is movie I would never, ever recommend, and PLEASE take this advice and use it! I mean, don't get me wrong, Kristin Davis and Tim Allen are good actors, but this wasn't for them. heck, I don't think Reese Witherspoon could have saved this trailer trash!I know Disney is trying to become a more broad studio, but this movies is in with Gigli and In the Mix, and for some advice for Disney, this isn't a place you want to be. I bet Walt is looking down at all of you and saying ""What the hell did you do to my empire? Why I oughta-"
843,tt0393735,3,"Shaggy Dog is a movie well suited for a younger audience, but is a groaner for anyone over fifteen. There are a few good jokes in there that would would spark a chuckle from the 'elders', and some of Tim Allen's dog-ish impressions might make you laugh but it will get old.The movie starts off like a mysterious Jackie Chan movie, set in Tibet. We are shown a temple where a sheep dog sits praying with the rest of the monks, but a foul plot is afoot: the military has been sent to kidnap this dog, which has been alive for more than 300 years. The evil Dr. Kozak (Robert Downey Jr.) wants to market a ""fountain of youth"" from the dogs DNA.Meanwhile, Dave Douglas (Tim Allen), a Washington D.A., is having an average American lifestyle. His kids know that he doesn't get them, and his wife is starting to realize that she is losing her husband to his job. When the 300 year old shaggy dog escapes the test lab and bites Douglas,he transforms into a dog at night, and has many dog-like tendencies throughout the day.Often, jokes are repeated throughout the movie, yet don't receive a ""running-joke"" label, but become annoying. However, Tim Allen's thoughts while a dog (""I don't know why I never tried this running on four legs thing before!"") are quite cute. All in all, it's like ""Good Boy"" with a slightly different story."
844,tt0393735,5,"(Synopsis) Dr. Kozak (Robert Downey Jr.) kidnaps a 300-year old Tibetan sheepdog in an attempt to discover the dog's secret of longevity and produce a fountain of youth drug. Unfortunately, all he has produced are animal mutations such as a king cobra-canine with a tail, a dog-frog that barks, and other mutations that are part dog. The sheepdog escapes the lab and is rescued by Carly Douglas (Zena Grey), who takes him home. Deputy District Attorney Dave Douglas (Tim Allen) is prosecuting Carly's teacher for the firebombing of Dr. Kozak's lab. Dave hates dogs, and after he is bitten by the sheepdog, the dog is sent to the pound. The dog has injected Dave with some of his DNA cells, and Dave begins to have canine urges and eventually, becomes a sheepdog. Dave learns the truth about his family and the drug company as a dog.(My Comment) This is a cute movie that you can take your children to. There are several funny scenes like the bathroom and park scenes that are just hilarious. I think they wasted their money on the CG effects on the cat chasing scene. If you look at the Shaggy Dog poster, you will see Tim Allen's eerie eyes. I enjoyed this movie, and you must remember that this is only a movie, and don't take the plot too seriously. (Note: The dog is actually a bearded collie.) (Walt Disney, Run time 1:38, Rated PG) (5/10)"
845,tt0758758,8,"I'm finding it hard to see why this film has taken such a tongue lashing (or keyboard lashing) by some people...mostly it is said that the main character is selfish and self indulgent, and that this film builds him up to be some kind of hero..but I think that's missing the point...through-out I was thinking about how, on one hand it was admirable that he wanted to break from the materialistic, money grabbing oppressive shackles placed on us by modern society, but on the other, how he had gone about it in such an irresponsible, hurtful and self-righteous way...the way he abandoned his parents and loving sister without a phone call note or explanation, and from the people he met along the way, like the kind old man and young romance, especially compounded this...and ultimately he realised this at the end by scribbling into a book, ""happiness only real when shared"" surely that is the lesson here! that his selfish, hurtful adolescent behaviour was wrong, and he ultimately paid a terrible cost.So ignore that haters...they are looking at this story the wrong way! Very much worth an open minded viewing!"
846,tt0758758,1,"I've never posted a comment regarding a movie but feel compelled to after attending a screening of Into The Wild at the Toronto Film Festival last night. I won't speak to story here as it's covered in the other comments.This is a movie of real beauty. It made me cry. I felt moved in a way that happens very rarely. It was an inspiration.The feelings it evoked were all based on the power of the acting and the writing. The words were real and human. The relationships seemed real and human. This may not seem like a great feat - but I consider it a true rarity. It didn't feel calculated and artificial, like so many movies (read: Crash - but I'm not here to bash that...). It was very organic, natural and (I can't say it enough) just beautiful. Cripes, it's making me sound like a hippie, for heaven's sake. This for me was Penn's best work since Indian Runner.What it reminded me of...Terence Malik - Herzog? - in a strange way Cassavettes? - Hal Ashby (more Coming Home than Harold & Maude...) - even a bit of Ken LoachRuby in Paradise - Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore - Five Easy Pieces - Easy Rider... but when I list those it's not because of plot similarities (though there are some) or style (although I think you can definitely see the influence of some great films) - it's again because of the heart of it. I heard a few people at the screening comment that the film was ""too long"" but I don't agree. I think exploring a journey of this magnitude required visiting all of the people he touched and taking the time to see the land.Hal Holbrook was just perfect, as was the cast as a whole, and I think Emile Hirsch is really going places - he was fantastic and he owned the role. Eddie Vedder's music worked perfectly as well - not distracting or quirky - just a part of the whole.The film received a standing ovation and quite a few tears were shed. Magic."
847,tt0758758,1,"The sensitivity with which Krakauer captured the essence of McCandless and his adventure is extended aptly to the movie format by Sean Penn. Even if one might not be able to appreciate the purpose for Alex's journey, I don't think anyone would be able to deny that Into the Wild is a sensitive and poignant cinematic experience. There are scenes in this movie that one will never be able to forget, particularly the ending sequence. This movie will easily pull its audience into a philosophical debate for the truth about who was right and wrong isn't easy to distinguish. Sean Penn certainly doesn't try to answer those questions, questions that McCandless' life left for his family and the rest of us. Penn does well to tread a delicate objective but not indifferent line. Certainly the best movie of this year and one of the best ever made. The story, the story itself is great."
848,tt0758758,9,"Sean Penn's new movie Into the Wild arrives on the wave of a well-regarded novel about a college graduate who decides that the anger and violence in civilized society is too much to handle and commences a journey through nature in order to truly live life as it was meant to be. This film is a wonderful glimpse into the life of a kid, wise beyond his years, and the bonds that he creates with people along the way. A victim of excess in wealth and a shortage of love, Christopher McCandless hid inside his mind behind knowledge and philosophy, building up his intellectual strength, as well as the physical, in order to complete his trek, ultimately leading him to Alaska. Penn never falls into the trap of showing too much heartbreak on the side of McCandless's parents, because he doesn't want the audience to second-guess the decision he made. There is no debate to be had here, our protagonist has no alternative but to get out and live off the land. Only being completely self-sufficient can he grasp a meaning for his life and one day perhaps go back with that knowledge fully learned.Emile Hirsch is absolutely brilliant with his good-natured attitude and affable charm. His character believes that human contact is not necessary for happiness and never seeks out relationships. However, his character is so likable that they find him and latch on, not to change his mind, but to experience his level of being and hopefully learn something from him and help enlarge his vocabulary on life. The people he meets help him to fully grasp the decision of life in the wild and be able to survive it. Never coming off condescendingly to those he crosses paths with, Hirsch always holds a smile on his face. One scene, where he meets up with a couple of people from Europe, proves how contagious a clear outlook on life without the troubles of societal restraints can be. These three kids have a blast, if only for a few minuteswith Hirsch being chased by the police for rafting with no licenseand it makes one wonder if maybe we all should take a journey into nature and feel the freedom and full warmth of heart that a lack of stress to succeed in the business world can give.All the supporting players are magnificent at helping show the side to McCandless that Penn needs on display to succeed. Hal Holbrook, Brian Dierker, and Catherine Keener are by far the best of these side characters with Vince Vaughn and Kirsten Stewart adding some charm too. Dierker, Keener, and Stewart play hippie, flower-child type roles and allow Hirsch to show off how modest and unselfish he is. This is the family he deserved to have from birth and he is the son they wished their lives had earned them. At their best, all four together give some of the most emotionally charged moments in the film. Holbrook, on-the-other-hand, helps give insight into the philosophy that Hirsch needs to live with in order to survive the loneliness, looking him in the face, to come in Alaska. It is truly fascinating to see how every person adds something to his overall experience and to the tools he needs.Hirsch deserves a lot of credit because he truly outshines the film itself with his dedication and sacrifice to the role. The length of time needed to allow him the ability to lose the weight necessary for a main plot point in the movie is crazy. If the time wasn't that long and Hirsch did it all rapidly, I'm even more impressed. With all that, there are many instances free of dialogue that he needs to carry with body language and actions alone. True, much of this is enhanced by a wonderful soundtrack from Eddie Vedder, but evenso it is a remarkable performance. Kudos to Sean Penn for a gorgeous filming job also. He captures the countryside with grace, while infusing many moments of visual style by slow-motioning glimpses, knowing when to show the family left behind, utilizing informative and essential voice-over, and even breaking the fourth wall. When Hirsch first looks into the camera, at the audience, it does not seem unnatural in the slightest, but instead an amazing link for the viewers to take a look into his soul like those that crossed his path have. McCandless is so pure that it almost feels like glimpsing the calm protectiveness of God."
849,tt0758758,1,"For a movie to be even better than a good book is no small feat. Yet, that's how I felt after watching this film. It really impressed me. One of the reasons is the fantastic cinematography. Man, this is a beautifully filmed and, at 142 minutes, there are a lot of great scenes to admire.Sean Penn directed and Eddie Gautier was the Director Of Photography. I can't stand Penn as a person but fair-is-fair and I think he's great as a director, having seen his work in ""The Pledge"" and ""The Crossing Guard."" The main actor, Emile Hirsch, who plays ""Chris McCandless"" (a.k.a. ""Alexander Supertramp"" reminded me of Leonardo DiCaprio with his looks, build and voice inflection. He is very credible as the young guy who wants nothing to do with materialistic society and dreams of living in the wilds of Alaska. The problem was that he was unprepared and underestimated what he was up against.Two people who fascinated me the most in here were two extremes, age-wise - Hal Holbrook and Kristen Stewart. It was really great to see the veteran Holbrook (""Ron France"") again. He was about 82 when he made this film and hadn't acted in a film in a few years. He was terrific, too. He had some of the most memorable scenes in the story. Meanwhile, teenager Stewart was captivating as ""Tracy Tatro,"" who had a crush on ""Alex."" This young woman is on her way to stardom.Brian Dierker and Catherine Keener also were really, really interesting as the aging hippie couple, ""Rainey"" and ""Jan."" I kept thinking, I know this guy when listening to Dierker's voice, finally guessing it was Jeff Bridges underneath all the beard....but it Dierker, a guy who rarely acts in films.Knowing the book, the only part of the film that caught be off-guard was the young Swedish couple. I don't remember them in the book but I'll never forget this in this film!! One could debate the pros and cons of Chris McCandless for hours, so no sense going into that here. I thought the film was pretty kind to him. You read more in the book about how he hurt a lot of people with his silence. Either way, it's a a fascinating story and a beautiful film."
850,tt0758758,1,"INTO THE WILD definitely works as a film - I had read the book so I certainly knew the tragic story of this young man's life but I was blown away by the performances. In fact, to have this young talent Emile Hirsch working with the old, legendary Hal Holbrook makes the film a must see - in fact, their scene near the end in the truck is one of the best pieces of acting I have ever seen on film - Holbrook is amazing there. He deserves a Best Supporting Actor nomination (but probably won't get it). The film is by no means perfect - there are pacing problems but Penn does use the flashbacks incredibly well and the film builds power as it goes along. Hirsch is so real - I remember noticing how talented he was in the indie flick Dangerous Life Of Altar Boys and I also thought he was very good in the so-so Alpha Dog film. But Penn gets a terrific performance out of him as well as Catherine Keener, Vince Vaughn, Wm. Hurt, Kirsten Stewart, jena Malone and everyone else for that matter. I can see how this film might not be for every one, but I was very moved by it and days later - certain images and moments stayed with me. Penn is getting better as a filmmaker with each movie he makes."
851,tt0317219,8,"""Cars didn't ride on it to make great time; they rode on it to have a great time."" It's not hard to make a successful movie. It's simple, really. Exceed my expectations. Make me feel. Force me to care. Deliver a somewhat clichéd message, but deliver it in such a way that the meaning resounds. Teach me the same lessons that your characters learn. And above all, entertain.Pretty easy, right? Well, at least Pixar makes it look that way because with Cars they have once again succeeded.I'll be honest; I had my doubts about the movie. How would they be able to take a story featuring nothing but vehicles, with nary a human in sight, and keep my interest for a full two hours? Animals are one thing, but could Pixar successfully master the personification of modes of transportation? Yes, they could, and they did.Thanks to Director Lasseter's strong attention to detail, going so far as to insist that the vehicles bend and gesture in ways that were true to their construction, every car and truck truly becomes a unique character and personality. And along with those characters and personalities comes a story which yes, contains a well-traveled theme, but it comes with so much charm that even Grouchy McKilljoy's hard little heart can't help but be warmed.Don't worry if you're not a racing fan; I assure you it's not a requirement to enjoy the movie. I love watching muscle cars race the quarter mile (ask me about my '69 Camaro), but NASCAR doesn't do it for me. That's another aspect about the film that gave me pause. I once fell asleep at a NASCAR qualifying race, despite the 90-degree heat and ear-splitting decibel levels, so would Cars keep me awake and interested? Within five minutes my worries began to slowly subside as I happily settled in for the ride.Animation should be about bringing imagination to life. Give us something that can't be done in live action. Cars does this so effectively that it almost seems a redundancy to comment on how Pixar continues to raise the CGI bar. The scenery on screen is awe-inducing to the point that it's getting harder to distinguish the real from the created. The filmmakers have gone so far as to perfect reflections in the cars and to pay careful attention to weeds growing out of cracks in the sidewalk. I don't see any way you could not be visually stunned.But impressive visuals are little comfort if I'm not presented with a story that I care to follow. No problems there. If you're the kind of person who loves to go ""awwwww"" at movies then prepare to be satisfied. What I appreciate the most is that, at the risk of causing some youngsters to become restless, time and attention has been given to character and story development. Lasseter and his team stood their ground and resisted any pressure to trim this to a runtime more suitable to those with limited attention spans, and I thank them for it.As I said earlier, Cars hit the starting line with a disadvantage. I didn't greet it with a warm smile. I crossed my arms, furrowed my brow, and dared it to prove my preconceived notions wrong.It proceeded to exceed my expectations. It made me feel for its characters and forced me to care about McQueen's journey, both to California and to a different viewpoint on life. Sure, the ""slow down and enjoy the scenery"" message may seem a little routine, but it's a message I took to heart.Immediately following the movie I was on the Internet looking up information regarding Route 66. I'm now ready for a road trip void of interstates and efforts to beat my best time. I feel like slowing down a bit and exploring the unknown. Give me the scenic route, and give me more finely-tuned, detailed movies like Cars. That's all I ask. Two hours of entertainment that make me care, even if briefly, about something other than myself and what goal has to be accomplished next.See? It was simple, really. At least Pixar made it look that way."
852,tt0317219,1,"But WHY is it great?1. Visually. From the very first moments of the film, my mouth was hanging open. I mean, what the hell? Nothing looks this good. I have no idea how they made the cars look so much like real cars, and STILL make them look so much like characters. And the settings? Having grown up and traveled all over the South West United States (including more than one pilgrimage down Route 66) They captured, not only the visuals, but the atmosphere and character America's Main Street Perfectly. Frankly, if you put real actors in many of the scenes, you wouldn't realize it was computer generated you know, if the landscape wasn't made up of old car parts.2. Creativity. Talking animals. Every cartoon HAS to have talking animals. Only so many cartoons can be about talking animals trying to bamboozle around with humans. Thank goodness for Cars. They create an entirely believable world populated by machines, with tractor cows, and somehow they still have George Jones and Hendrix. The story IS quite predictable, but it's still quite creative. With this level of creative juice flowing in one of John's babies, I can't wait to see what he has in store for further feature animation and theme parks.3. Characters. I have a beef with Hollywood. They have no idea what life in a small town is like. They either try and stuff their ideals and attitude into a western shirt, or else fill America's heartland with dolts, ""we don't like outsiders"" sheriffs, or crazed murderers. Thankfully, Pixar did their homework and featured small town folk as they really are: eclectic, eccentric, loyal, creative with their fun, friendly with visitors, and really worth while. The subtle touches, such as the lovable rivalry between the Hippie van and the Army truck, or the crazy old Model T talking to the memorial of her dead husband (very touching), gives a complex and wonderfully, realistically diverse view off small town life. The same is true with the racing world. Wilson and Newman are, of course, fantastic. It's funny how the gravel in Newman's voice fits perfectly with the rumble of his engine, likewise Wilson's distinct voice sounds just like the high-tuned growl of a race car. Every voice is so paired. Bottom line, you leave loving virtually every character in the movie.4. Story. A little bit A Christmas Carol, a little bit The Sting. The story starts out fast and exciting, like the race it portrayed. The big second act meanders lazily from one fantastic story point to the next, just like Route 66 drives from one landmark to another. I can see why some may say it can get slow, but, as is one of the points of the story, the joy is in the ride. And again, the third act flows quickly and furiously like, well, another race.I give it a score of 10 out of 10. I can't wait to see it again."
853,tt0317219,9,"People do have their own opinions but there is one thing I came across with, why do some people don't like this movie? I've seen when it came out in 2006 and loved it and I think its better then its sequel, in my opinion. Is because of the world of talking cars? Disney has created many films were animals talk, look at the Mickey Mouse cartoons, there is no people in there world, minus the ones during the early years of Disney. The story can be clichéd, a big city race car driver goes to a small town, caused a ruck, hates the small town, get to know them and realises he was a jerk and so on and so forth. To me I like this movie. It has some nice atmosphere with the small town and the American dessert of the well- known route 66 with the animation and I do like the world of cars. The story is good too and even though its not in the bar of such great films like the Toy Story series and Monsters Inc. from Pixar, it's good recommendable movie for your kids."
854,tt0317219,1,"I had my doubts. I knew that Pixar would fail this time around. No way were they going to pull this off for a seventh time.I was very, very wrong.I went to see a special screening of ""Cars"" a few weeks ago, and this movie blew me away. The animation is gorgeous, the story brings a smile to your face, and you can't help falling in love with all of the colorful characters. It definitely has that genuine Pixar ""heart"" that you rarely see in any other CGI film. At first I thought the movie would be centered around a lot of NASCAR-like racing, but it really wasn't, much to my surprise (and pleasure). This movie is definite Pixar gold. I absolutely loved it.Although I don't want to give any spoilers away, I will say that my favorite scene would have to be when Mater drags McQueen out to do a bit of ""Tractor Tipping"". The whole theater was filled with laughter. Heck, it even got some laughs out of me, which is rare when it comes to a kid's movie.Be there on opening night. This is movie is worth all of your time and money."
855,tt0317219,1,"I saw this film on May 31st, 2006 in Indianapolis. I am one of the judges for the Heartland Film Festival's Truly Moving Picture Award. A Truly Moving Picture ""explores the human journey by artistically expressing hope and respect for the positive values of life."" Heartland gave that award to this film.The most famous streak in sports is probably Joe DiMaggio's 56 game hitting streak. The most famous hit streak in film entertainment is probably Pixar's feature film animation streak. With ""Cars"", it's seven in row for outstanding storytelling that is well executed and is (or will be) rewarded with blockbuster box office grosses. ""Toy Story"", ""Toy Story 2"", ""Monsters, Inc."", ""Finding Nemo"", ""The Incredibles"", and ""A Bug's Life"" are the other six gems.The story is about Lightning McQueen a rookie NASCAR-type racer. Of course, he is a car and not a human; or, he is a human in the form of the car. Take your pick. Either way, he is not an attractive persona. He is selfish, unappreciative, greedy, two-faced and has no real friends. But, he is a great driver and is tied for The Piston (read Winston) Cup annual championship with two other drivers. On the way to the runoff race in California, he accidentally gets off in a sleepy and forgotten town on Route 66 named Radiator Springs.In this hillbilly hell of a town, he is punished for speeding and tearing up the road by the sheriff. As he serves his sentence with community work, he discovers the town is inhabited by rejects and misfits, who all have hearts of gold. Can they change Lightning and make him over to have positive traits like honesty, integrity, respect, honor, sacrifice, humility, and compassion? That's the drama that unfolds. Lightning is a hard case, and the outcome is always in doubt.The cars/people are incredible. Shortly into the movie you forget that the people are cars or the cars are people, you suspend disbelief, and you just begin to watch an engaging story about real people. The windshields are their eyes, and the grilles are their mouths, and they display emotions as well as any human actor. The story is serious and light-hearted at the same time. The puns are too numerous to catch. And this is a must-see-twice-to-get-it-all movie.FYI  There is a Truly Moving Pictures web site where there is a listing of past Truly Moving Picture Award winners that are now either at the theater or available on video."
856,tt0383574,8,I don't know why so many people say that this oneis not good enough like the first movie. This has some better made actions than the first and very good job by thedirector who makes many great scenes whichmake more ..... the movie.
874,tt0445990,1,"I gave this film a 10 rating which is highly unusual for me. But, upon reflection, I could find NOTHING wrong with it. The actors are perfectly cast. The musical score is great at transporting you back to the day. The scripting is wonderfully low-key and seemingly true to life. There is no overwhelming sentimentality, yet there is also no unnecessary violence or foul language. In short, it's perfect.Wahlberg can consider this one of his shining moments. As can the rest of the cast. I'm not even a football fan. But, after reading strong reviews, especially about Wahlberg's performance, I took a chance and went. On my ""Mom's night out."" I was thinking ""If this stinks, then I've wasted a night that won't come around for another week or two."" I came home and told my husband ""Honey, we've got to see this football film together."" He looked at me as though I'd lost my mind. If they made more sports films like this one, then I'd go. I'll be buying the DVD. For the whole family."
857,tt0383574,8,"Well, first of all, when I read the review for the movie in my hometown paper, I was a little scared that Pirates might be a let down. The trailer and the movie clips, it seemed, didn't really let on that there was much of a story line -- that it just kind of goes on and on and on, like the Matrix 2, with no storyline -- just fighting. Plus, most people do agree: sequels are hardly ever as good as the originals. And in this case, it's true... Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest isn't the original. But, its an awesome movie in its own right! There are a few surprises in this movie. A few characters come back from the first that you wouldn't expect to see in the second. but... um! that's all I'm saying. This movie is definitely a lot more violent and gory than the first one. Don't bring the little kids to it. But, trust me -- this is not a Matrix-type movie... There is an actual storyline. And a good one at that. Capt. Jack Sparrow is back as well as Elizabeth and Will, who are forced to find him and obtain his compass, or else they will face the gallows. Well, actually, Will has to find him. Elizabeth escapes, and yes... as you've seen in the trailers, she does dress up like a man for this movie. Making it all the more comical. (you'll see what I mean).The comedy was superb in this movie. Of course, it wasn't as good as the first, but you can't expect it to be. Yes, there were a few instances were they could've shortened the fighting scenes, but it was very well shot and scripted.I wish they would've changed a few things about the movie, but you can't have everything. And don't expect everything to be resolved at the end. No! There's a cliff-hanger ending that leaves you wanting the watch the next one the moment the credits start rolling.If you like the first movie, you'll like the second... And that's all I'm saying.Jack Sparrow: ""Why is the rum *always* gone?"" (he stands up and staggers) ""Oh... That's why."""
858,tt0383574,8,"This movie has everything a good blockbuster should have: star cast, special effects, a healthy dose of drama, romance, a villain (so to say), sadly also a rather weak story, with an ending just calling for ""part three"" (just like the last second in the Matrix trilogy) I didn't get that feeling, that the adventure is finished somehow, more like a soap opera ending. On the other hand some dialogs are really funny, and the whole movie is more like a parody on pirates. All and all: go and see this, sit down in that cinema and have a good time with friends, but if you are more into ""heavy for the mind"" stuff, this is not a must-see for you."
859,tt0383574,8,"Some blockbuster movies pretend to be more than they actually are. They sometimes even try to be philosophical. 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest', thank goodness, does no such thing. From start to finish, it practically flaunts the fact that it is pure and utter entertainment, comic yet breathtaking. The slapstick comedy involving the various sequences on the cannibal island and the water mill are amusing, the scenes at sea with the Flying Dutchman and the Kraken draw gasps, and, as ever, the antics of Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow brings endless pleasure. Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Swann does her share too, but Orlando Bloom as William Turner is still somewhat...wooden, perhaps because of the insipid character that he plays. His (almost idiotic) chivalry and goodness simply does not click with the mischievous magnetism that Jack Sparrow and Elizabeth Swann delivers. He still does amuse from time to time, however. The supporting cast is truly stellar; Bill Nighy as Captain Davy Jones, Stellan Skarsgard as Bill 'Boostrap' Turner and Naomie Harris as Tia Dalma are simply brilliant. Bill Nighy delivers his lines with aplomb, smacking his lips as if he relishes each syllable. Stellan Skarsgard is completely believable as the wretched Bootstrap Bill, a man who has fallen to the depths as far as he can go, and yet can still find the strength to endure it all in the love he has for his son, William. Naomie Harris is just as charismatic as the former two, but her charisma is not menacing or stoic but mysterious and even alluring. When she grins her black-toothed grin, one cannot help but grin along with her. In the end, 'Dead Man's Chest' is a roller-coaster-ride of a movie that thoroughly exploits every minute of its two-and-a-half-hour running time, ending with a final cliffhanger that leaves people feeling excited yet frustrated. (Remember when you watched 'Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring' and realized that you would have to wait another year for 'The Two Towers'? Like that.) NB. If you have the patience, stay till the end of credits. It's mildly amusing."
860,tt0383574,1,"As a sequel, it had much to live up to the glory of the first film, and personally, I thought it had done rather well. The special effects on Bill Nighy (Davey Jones) and his pirate crew was perhaps the best; it was very realistic. The movie had a bit of a slow start, but overall was a wonderful film. Johnny Depp did well in his portrayal of Captain Jack Sparrow, as previously in the first film. Keira Knightley and Bill Nighy were also of mentionable performances. I thought Orlando Bloom was a little wooden, as I thought of his performance in the first film, but still believable and he managed to pull it off. The ending which was rather interesting, served its purpose in suspense. It left the audience hanging, and it also left me hanging in a buzz of questions. I'm extremely eager to see the next Pirates of Caribbean film. However, the film did contain quite a number of references to the first film, The Curse of the Black Pearl, and I advise you to recap your knowledge of the first film and re-watch it to get the gist. Overall, I believed the second Pirates of Carribbean was a rather good film, and very successful in standards of sequels. I can't wait for the third."
861,tt0383574,9,"After seeing all three of the ""Pirates Of The Caribbean"" films, I still think this second one was easily the best of the three. Most friends disagree with me on this, but.....hey, we all look at films differently.This was the best ""Pirates"" to me because it had some fascinating new characters; it did not have the sappy or annoying characters and romance of the first film; it had just the right mix of action and lulls and it had some super special-effects and humor. Much of that good stuff, unfortunately, was overdone in the third film.which also dragged on too long. This movie isn't short, but none of the action scenes go on too long and so the entire two-and-a-half hours is entertaining.Also (and this goes for all three of the movie) it looks absolutely super on Blu-Ray. It's the reason POTC is often shown in electronic stores promoting high-definition televisions because this film is about as good-looking as it gets. It's incredibly sharp.The newest main character is the multi-tentacled ""Davy Jones,"" and he's a real hoot. Who knows how many hours each day poor Bill Nighy had to sit in the makeup room before ""Davy"" was ready for action. (Actually, the same good be said for Johnny Depp's ""Capt. Jack Farrow, who wears almost has much makeup as the late Tammy Fae Bakker.) Anyway, between the battles of both land and sea, something interesting always is going on or being said in this movie, making it a fun ride all the way."
862,tt0383574,9,"I just came out of the movie 30 minutes ago (as it was released a day before America over here).The movie is visually stunning - the CGI is top rate and you won't spend the whole film groaning about how fake things appear on the screen.Acting was brilliant. Johnny Depp once again proves why he's the only man alive who can play the role of Cap. Jack Sparrow. There's a great number of returning characters from the first film - including a couple I was very happy to see again.My only fault was perhaps that this film lack a certain 'heart' that the first film had, which I believe came because the first film was something very different, which of course this film couldn't contend with.That aside, you will hardly notice it. There's a good plot, wonderful sets, great acting and plenty of laughs. One of the best films I've seen all year thus far - can't wait for the 3rd one!"
863,tt0383574,1,"I have seen many movies get tons of hate that I actually like but this movie has to be the most underrated movie I've seen currently. There are so many great moments like the Introduction including Jacks return, the kraken, davy jones, the skeleton balls, especially the last 40 minutes with the absolutely amazing fight going on. This movie is always interesting or fun, I don't care if its """"""objectively"""""" not a good movie, it's still very entertaining and interesting to watch. Even the flaming skull is probably the coolest logo in the POTC saga. I still like the first movie in fact it's my second favorite out of the saga but this is the best one in my personal (yet nostalgic) opinion"
864,tt0383574,1,"I only have one thing to say about this film... BRILLIANT (with a capital B)! Although there were some brilliant moments in the film, it was Johnny Depp who was a standout for me. His witty moments (especially when he says 'Oh, bugger' when confronted by the tribe) were wonderful. There are some moments here that were nasty (not gross/gory nasty), so the little kiddies may want to avoid this one. (It is rated M in Australia, PG-13 for America) But, it was a brilliant film. If you don't get to see it on the big screen, get the DVD when it comes out. You will not be disappointed! P.S. Did anyone love the new Walt Disney Pictures logo at the beginning? I did. I can't wait to see it again on DVD!"
865,tt0383574,9,"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest does the right thing as a sequel: It maintains the same carefree spirit of the original and creates an even more fitting story to the whole Pirates lore. After narrowly escaping the gallows--with the help of his friends Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley)--and reclaiming his cursed Black Pearl, it still seems Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) has a few more fish to fry. More specifically the barnacle-encrusted undead on board the ghostly Flying Dutchman, lead by Mr. Octopus Face himself, Davy Jones (Bill Nighy). Jack apparently owes a blood debt to the inky captain and if he can't find a way out of it--namely locating the secret contents of Jones' famed locker--Sparrow will be doomed to eternal damnation and servitude in the afterlife (insert Jack Sparrow's face of disgust here). Making matters worse, Sparrow's problems manage to interfere with the wedding plans of Will and Elizabeth, who are forced to join Jack on yet another one of his misadventures.Depp's Oscar-nominated performance as Captain Jack is still a marvel in slovenly pirate behavior, with his slurred speech, swaying swagger and slack, waving arms. But whether channeling famed Rolling Stones' guitarist Keith Richards or not, it's the duality of the character that continues to intrigue us. He is a lusty, fearless man with a deeply defiant and somewhat sneaky streak but whose delicate features, long, dread locked hair, Kohl-rimmed eyes and almost girly mannerisms give him a subtly effeminate air that belies his macho antics. This time around, young Brits Knightley and Bloom have a little more to do, with Elizabeth's growing attraction to Jack and Will's reunion with his father, Bill ""Bootstrap"" Turner (Stellan Skarsgård), who's soul is stuck on the Flying Dutchman. And Nighy (Love Actually) once again makes his mark as an effective villain, infusing his rather quirky acting ticks--the laconic delivery, the laid-back attitude--which shines through all the special effects make-up. Let's just say, Nighy certainly rivals Depp in the arrogant rock star stance, even if he has tentacles for a face.The other thing Dead Man's Chest does right is make things bigger and better. From a hair-raising sword fight on top of a spinning water wheel to the way Davy Jones and his crew look--all water logged and crustacean-like--the film's production value is simply amazing. Returning producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Gore Verbinski make sure the action sequences, the sets, the costumes, the make-up and the special effects give the audience a familiarity to the original while also taking them on a whole new adventure. And if you are a fan of the Disney park attraction (the one at Disneyland, not Disney World), the elements that got missed in the first one--the creepy bayou, the beating heart in the treasure chest--are in this sequel. Dead Man's Chest does lag a bit from time to time, especially in heating up the Jack, Elizabeth and Will love triangle. But that's OK. We enjoy watching their banter, as much as we do the rest of it. And for those who'll want more adventure after the movie ends, Dead Man's Chest gives us a promise the third installment will be just as much pirate fun.9/10"
903,tt0449088,8,"The Pirates of the Caribbean-movie serials is probably one I'll never grow tired off. The characters are fun and great, always adventurous and spectacular to watch. It's really too bad that this time they felt the need to make things even bigger, more complex and conclusive than the previous two movies. Really not needed. In my opinion the first movie ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" is still the best because of the reason that it's simple, fun and choices to be purely entertaining. They already went wrong with this approach during the second movie; ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"", when they put in more new characters and different hard to follow plot lines. ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End"" goes on in the same trend as the previous movie. There are more new characters and as far as the new many plot-lines are concerned...well let me just say that after a while I just gave up trying to understand the movie and just let the movie take me away with its visuals, humor and other entertaining elements. And this movie regardless should really be able to take you away on a roller-coaster-ride of pure entertainment.No doubt in my mind that this movie could had become the best one out of the series. It had all the potential and budget for that, now if they had only cut down about halve of the script...Most of the plot-lines seem redundant and are actually far from believable because they contradict from what happened in the first two movies. The many betrayals among characters and side-picking became really confusing after a while, till it reached a point when you just didn't knew who was fighting for what. But like I said before, after a while you just stop caring about it and simply enjoy the movie for what it brings you. It all is also the reason why the movie is now nearly 3 hours long. Now the movie is not as good and entertaining as the first but maybe just slightly better than the second one, because of the large scale of this movie. The movie is definitely big. There is no lack of action as some people claim there is. There is just as much action as there is in the first two movies, only difference this time is that the movie is nearly 3 hours long and therefor the movie also has some more talking-sequences and slower moments in it.The movie is also big with its musical score by Hans Zimmer and he actually succeeded in composing a new great theme for the movie. In its action moments the movie gets definitely uplifted by its musical score.The action sequences are definitely well constructed and at times pure eye candy. So are the special effects, although I feel that the second movie was still better on that. It seems like they tried to overdo things this time and I'm mainly talking about the end battle, when it comes down to its special effects, by putting in some complex shots. No matter how good CGI is these days, you still see that it's CGI. Most roles get extended in this movie. Marty, Tia Dalma and even Jack the monkey and Cotton's parrot. But of course the movie still remains the Jack Sparrow-show. Really one of the best characters in recent years, all thanks to Johnny Depp, who provide the movie with its biggest laughs and most hilarious absurd moments. He still plays the character as good and fresh as he did for the first time 4 years ago. You can't just ever grow tired of Jack Sparrow. I was also very pleased to see Geoffrey Rush back as Barbossa. His role was bigger which allowed Geoffrey Rush to shine even more. Bill Nighy was also as good as always as Davy Jones. Orlando Bloom's and Keira Knightley's acting also has really improved over the years. I was actually surprised to see how much of the movie Keira Knightley carries this time and how well she does this. Even in the sequences with Geoffrey Rush she does. She also gets to do more interesting in the movie when it comes done to action. In a way she has taken over the Will (Orlando Bloom) role in this movie this time and Will himself gets pushed more to the background this time compared to the first two movies, which really shouldn't bother most people, unless you're a teenage-girl of course. She handles both the action- and comical sequences really well. And even Keith Richards shows up in an already classic cameo as Jack's father. But some role also got narrowed down to my regret, such as Jonathan Pryce's and Jack Davenport's and lets not forget the Kraken.Still, I really wouldn't mind seeing more Pirates of the Caribbean movies in the future, if needed with new actors and characters, as long as Johnny Depp stays as Jack Sparrow. The serials still have more than enough potential and haven't dried up yet.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
866,tt0445990,8,"Really enjoyed this film. Went with my almost 13 year old son who is just starting his first participation in organized football in school and I think the film really inspired him.No the film does not focus on the Eagles professional sports organization. So if you're looking for a film that does that, you're probably going to be disappointed.The film focuses on our hero and to a large degree his neighborhood friends and what it was like for a 30 year old bartender who only played organized football in high school and how he showed up one Saturday at an unprecedented open try out for a professional football team and how he was selected....not selected to join the team automatically.No, he was only selected for a spot to possibly be on the team. It took a few weeks of being with the team and surviving 'cuts' until he was actually part of the team.The fact that he did make it, against all the odds, is certainly your classic fairy tale come true.Disney manages to show rough guys from a rough part of Philadelpia and rough professional football players realistically without ever having to utter one profanity on the screen or use gratuitous violence or vulgarity to do it. That's an accomplishment Disney should be proud of.Honestly, as a movie buff, it's been a long time since I've gone to the movies where I was able to stay engaged throughout the running time of the movie.The movie isn't pretentious nor does it take the easy way out in telling its story of rough blue collar characters-by employing vulgarity, overt sexuality or excessive violence.It relies on tried and true methods like a good storyline, taking the time to establish a good foundation in the beginning of the movie, letting the audience get to know the characters involved and then when the bigger more dramatic moments come it doesn't need to rely on over the top special affects to get the audience involved.That being said, the actual professional football game scenes are well done with just enough special affects to give the audience the feel that these actors really were on that playing field playing the game.I really can't say enough about this movie. When all the hype fades away on other overly marketed & bigger budgeted movies, it will be a movie like this one, that you'll reach for over and over again in your personal movie library.And while we're at it, hats off to Mark Whalberg for a sensitive, well acted portrayal."
867,tt0445990,8,"After just seeing ""Invincible"" I must say thumbs up! Way to go that finally after 30 years this true story is brought to the big screen. Call me bias or partial because I'm an Eagles fan, but the story of any underdog making an NFL team makes you happy. 30 year old bartender and part-time school teacher Vince Papale who finds life a struggle from his wife leaving him, to problems paying his bills he finds only one hope that is to escape thru his love and passion for the Eagles. Papale a season ticket holder and sandlot football star decides to give himself a shot at a better life in 1976 when newly hired coach Dick Vermil decides to hold open tryouts. Papale has the odds stacked against him, but thru his will and determination to make it, because no one ever expected him to do anything he prevails! Papale lands a roster spot as a special teams player a blue-collar guy doing blue collar work on the field. The scenes and background of this movie, especially the way Veterans Stadium is shown is sketchy and unbelievable, but the story is true and touching. Vince Papale played for the Eagles for three seasons, well acted and done by Mark Wahlberg who showed enthusiasm with this role. Also Greg Kinnear is great as legendary head coach Dick Vermeil, overall a great movie of an underdog that leaves you smiling at the end. I hope more real-life NFL movies are made about players, because ""Invincible"" sets the standard."
868,tt0445990,8,"Both Mark Wahlberg and Greg Kinnear are such naturals in delivering their characters. When in fact, from the production notes, Wahlberg went through actual football training/coaching, being there with the team for every play and practice, gaining insight into his portrayal of a real living person. Both met their inspired 'hero'. For Kinnear, he received confirmation when Vermeil's son indicated that he got his father's mannerism/cadence spot on. The operative word here is 'genuine,' caring and intensely so. They worked hard preparing and learning to correctly portray the two NFL notables.Papale and Vermeil - they needed each other (or fate brought them together). In a way, both are in the same boat: struggling to gain confidence by the rest of the team. Against all odds, they did it and won over the rest of the South Philly Eagles team and the PA fans. Yes, it is inspirational. Yes, it's been told before. Why so different? This film being NFL sanctioned is the more earnest in getting it right in every respect for authenticity. The shots of the different plays and athletic moves get up close and real with a trained acting team and augmented sound design.Double duty as director of photography and director of his debut feature film, Ericson Core, faithfully puts us in the year 1976 recreated. The Jim Croce song that started the film ""I Got A Name"" is reminiscently catchy and hints at the personal struggles of Papale. With Sara Knowles (""Gattaca"") production design, Susan Lyall (""Mississippi Masala"") costume design, vital Football Coordinator Mark Ellis (""Miracle"") who studied/choreographed the plays and moves for specific film shoot, and having Vince Papale and Dick Vermeil as consultants at hand, Brad Gann's script and a strong supportive team of producers, all made ""INVINCIBLE"" unarguably a worthwhile film to see.I went into the cinema with no expectations - feeling fortunate to see Wahlberg and Kinnear both in one movie. I find the film heartwarming (a tearjerker for me, too). It encourages roots: remember the buddy friends, neighborhood community and parents who'd stand by us. The tenacity to not give up - keep trying, focus on task at hand - doing your best is no failure no matter what others may think. The integrity of one's character and believing in oneself is not easy to sustain in hard times. Support system close to you is important: Papale has Janet's encouragement and Vermail has his wife's timely reminders. We need such spirits genuinely emanated in films like ""Invincible."" Greg Kinnear came a long way from the remake of ""Sabrina"" opposite Harrison Ford. His diverse roles in ""As Good As It Gets"" opposite Jack Nicholson, ""Auto Focus"" opposite Willem Dafoe, ""The Matador"" opposite Pierce Brosnan, and ""Little Miss Sunshine"" along with an ensemble of talents, demonstrated how vastly skillful he's become. Mark Wahlberg can be underrated - it's almost all him in ""Boogie Nights"", funny fantastic in ""The Big Hit"", quietly solid in ""The Yard"" (opposite James Caan), 'funkily' good in ""Rock Star"", smooth action in ""The Italian Job"" remake, gritty action in ""Four Brothers"" - he holds his own in a wide variety of complex and challenging roles, be it ""Three Kings"" or ""I Heart Huckabees""."
869,tt0445990,8,"I just came from and advanced screening tonight and it was an entertaining feel-good movie. The movie is based on a true ""local guy makes good"" story, and quite entertaining (although after searching online for Papale, it appears that they may have taken a bit of dramatic license with some of the details). The story telling and acting were good. I think Kinnear's presentation of Dick Vermeil (I remember seeing Vermeil on the local T.V. a lot back then) was outstanding. Mark Wahlberg gave a credible performance as a determined underdog here, he seems to be maturing as an actor, and from what I could tell was in good physical condition to play this role. Kirk Acevado and Mark Raspoli put in good supporting performances as (sometime) supportive friends and relatives. The movie is an O.K. family movie if you don't mind a bit of swearing and sports/football violence (tackles, blocks and those sorts of things).I grew up in eastern Pennsylvania, and can remember the atmosphere in my home town and, to a lesser extent, Philadelphia at that time. The decline of manufacturing, labor disputes and unemployment/hardship on workers and their families was well presented. My recollections of the Eagles were that the team was pretty weak and the fans being very vocal in their disappointment (this is a Philadelphia tradition for all their sports, it isn't just reserved for football). Among my favorite scenes is some neighborhood football that brought back some memories (although our games were a bit less brutal). There are a number of funny scenes in the movie and quick one-liners (which I won't spoil here)."
870,tt0445990,7,"First off - I'm biased. Let me get that out of the way first. I grew up in Center City Philly during the 70's and am a life-long Eagles fan. So, I was pretty excited to see the movie to get juiced for the upcoming 2006 Eagles season while also hoping to relive Philly life from 1976.The movie starts by giving us some background on the plight of the 1975 Eagles (a pretty bad team) and Vince Papale (a man pretty down on his luck). Little did both the team and Vince know their fortunes were about to change with the arrival of Dick Vermeil, the new head coach of the Eagles.The basic need of any biographical movie is that it MUST establish a relationship with the audience in order for us to be emotionally connected to the movie. I would say that Invincible only does a ""so-so"" job with this. For example, I recently saw ""Walk The Line"", if that movie does one thing well is it makes us really care about Johnny Cash and June Carter. On the other hand, Mark Wahlberg's version of Vince Papale keeps us at a distance while offering only limited insight into what really makes Vince tick. It doesn't help that the script keeps Mark's lines to a minimum. This doesn't seem to jive with the real Vince Papale, a very high energy man who always has something to say. On the other hand, Greg Kinnear does a GREAT rendition of Dick Vermeil. He really nailed Dick in personality and mannerisms.The best part of the movie are the visuals. The movie does a great job recreating Philadelphia life in 1976, what it was like to be an Eagle fan in the 70's and 1970's NFL life before the mega-millions contracts and cushy locker rooms with every amenity imaginable. These aspects of the movie, I thoroughly enjoyed.However, there were a couple noticeable misses in this recreation. There was no mention at all of the 1976 Bicentennial in the movie. This was a pretty big miss since the entire city was wrapped up in the celebration. Another thing that puzzled me was the ""woes us"" attitude from the Phiilly fans in the movie. This really wasn't the case in Philadelophia at the time. Yes, the Eagles were bad, but the Phillies made the playoffs that year, the Sixers went to the NBA finals behind Dr. J, and the Flyers had just won two Stanley Cups. While I'm on the portrayal of the Philly fans, some of it was a little over the top. When the Eagles are losing by several touchdowns late in the game, everyone doesn't stay to boo, and we certainly don't threaten other fans to stay. I laughed at most of it because I knew it was more caricature than real life. But I know there are people out there who think thats how Philly fans really are. From me to you, it's more myth than fact.Overall, I'm giving the movie 7 out of 10. But, if Vince Papale were a Giant, I'd only give it 6 out of 10."
871,tt0445990,7,"Never underestimate the power of a good story, decent acting and a great soundtrack. That's what Disney's ""Invincible,"" starring Mark Wahlberg and Greg Kinnear, brings to viewers. The studio has made some decent sports entries, including ""Remember The Titans,"" and last's year's golf film, ""The Greatest game Ever Played,"" so they know their stuff.""Invincible"" is the biographical tale of down-on-his-luck Vince Papale (Wahlberg), who is a pretty fair street football player in Philadelphia in the mid-1970s. He is also a substitute teacher, but when he loses that gig, is forced to tend bar part-time.Meanwhile, his team, the NFL Eagles  mired in several seasons of last-place finishes (making the franchise the joke of the NFC East)  hires a new head coach, Dick Vermeil (Kinnear), who decides to hold an open tryout for players. It's looked upon as a joke, and hundreds of untalented and out-of-shape clowns show up at Veteran's Stadium for the event, even Vince (who never played college ball and is sure he is not good enough to get a second look). On a fluke, however, he is the only walk-on allowed to go to training camp.Meanwhile, he becomes sort of a neighborhood celebrity, and develops a sweet love affair with his boss' cousin, Janet (Elizabeth Banks, ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin,"" the TV series, Scrubs""), a die-hard New York Giants fan.He impresses Vermeil enough to make it down to the final cut, but what happens after that, you'll have to find out yourself.Wahlberg might be a tad bit small for an NFL player (he's much smaller than the real Papale), but he is appropriately well-built; and his low-key performance gives real pathos to his character.It's Kinnear, however, who steals the picture. I must admit, when he first appears on screen, there are a few giggles; but he eases into the role of the harried skipper (whom many did not expect to last the year) and does a tremendous job.Lastly, since the story takes place in 1975 (the year my old favorite team, the St. Louis Cardinals, won the NFC East), you would expect the soundtrack to blast some high quality tunes. In this respect, the film does not disappoint. Tunes from The Who, Jim Croce, Bachman-Turner Overdrive, Canned Heat, Edgar Winter Group, Grand Funk Railroad, Rod Stewart, Elvin Bishop, Rare Earth and others, highlights this movie-going experience.A bit sappy, at times, but overall, a nice little biopic that is one of the more inspiring movies of 2006."
872,tt0445990,1,"Not just for Philadelphia Eagles fans, but for all sports fans who love a great underdog story. Watching this film, I was transported back to the gritty streets of South Philly in 1976, watching the impossible dream unfold for a guy down on his luck, but determined to change his life with his love for football -- and for his favorite team, the Eagles. Mark Wahlberg did an excellent job playing the improbable hero Vince Papale. The supporting cast is also very good, with a great turn by Elizabeth Banks, who believes in Vince's dream of making it in the NFL. It shows that with hard work and determination, anything is possible. A film for the whole family to enjoy!"
873,tt0445990,8,"Despite Mark Wahlberg's reputation as a person, i am a fan of his films and his work, and he didn't disappoint me in Invincible. The film had a way of bringing my age home, since i remember Vince Papale, how bad the Eagles were, Dick Vermeil and of course, the infamous Tom Landry, so this film was nostalgic for me. I recall the music of that time too, and, thankfully, i didn't notice any disco. I expected to see an inspiring football film, and for the most part, it was. But it had something else i really wasn't expecting, which for me was the essence of this film, and that was, camaraderie, support, atmosphere, and friendship. I was happy to see Michael Kelly too, the seeming A**h** who turned out to be a courageous, self-sacrificing guy in Dawn of the Dead (remake).I am not a fan at all of Ericson Core's other projects, with the exception of The Fast and the Furious, and i noticed that he was the cinematographer as well as the directer here. He did a good job. There were certain touches which i appreciated, such as the sequence where Vince was driving around trying to find some inspiration. He saw a young boy playing football with his number, 83, taped on his back; and he saw his friends playing football in the mud, a long-held tradition amid the backdrop of unemployment, strikes, and hard times in a working class city with gutsy people. One could argue that yes, this film was very formulaic. But the film was ""inspired"" by a real person; a son of Philadelphia; the city's biggest fan. I feel the film could have used another five minutes or so at the end, for a less abrupt denouement; but perhaps it was because Invincible was about courage, determination, the American dream, family and friends. Those aspects came through very well, even in spite of Papale's life-long struggles with self confidence and esteem. I'd recommend this film for most people. Not just football fans."
875,tt0445990,6,"Somewhat loosely based on a true story, INVINCIBLE is your standard root-for-the-underdog sports movie, nothing more, nothing less. Mark Wahlberg is Vince Papale, a beefy touch football player/bartender who struts his stuff at an open tryout for the Philadelphia Eagles. Overcoming tremendous odds, Papale cracks the roster after earning the faith of rookie coach Dick Vermeil (Greg Kinnear).INVINCIBLE probably would have been better as a less family-friendly film. Everything happens so cleanly in this Disney pic that it loses some of its realism and credibility. The audience may also feel cheated given the extreme liberties the writers took with the Papale story, including a complete disregard for his pro pigskin experience, fabricating an open-to-the-public tryout and the invention of a ""you won't amount to anything"" note from Papale's former partner. No bio pic is 100 per cent truthful, but this is going a bit too far.While there is a certain charm and inspirational underpinning to INVINCIBLE, it can't hold a handle to many of the other entries of the same genre. It's one of those movies that can be summed up with four words: good but never great. The performances are good but never great. The direction is good but never great. The list goes on. Junior high-aged kids will probably appreciate this one the most."
876,tt0398808,1,"Review: By Morgan StewartIt is hard to put into writing just how marvelous and wonderful Bridge to Terabithia really is, yet as I attempt it, I can't help feeling disturbed at how ridiculous people are being about the marketing of this film. Thank goodness most real critics have looked past the agreeably deceptive marketing, into the heart and beauty of this film, which, with or with the misleading advertisements is impressive. After seeing it, I struggled to think of a better way of marketing this film, without giving away its ending or taking away the only audience that still seems to watch PG movies, kids.After watching it, however, I couldn't imagine taking anyone under ten to see it, nor could I imagine anyone under ten enjoying it as much as young adults, or even older audiences would. So, as deceptive as the advertising was, I myself realize that the fascinating story, the charm and skill of the actors, and the good direction of newcomer to live action film-making, Gabor Csupo, more than makes up for the slightly skewed first impressions. And I am eternally grateful that it did not turn into what everyone seemed to want, a cheesy Narnia rip-off. If anything, the movie was a lot better than the preview made it seem to be, and I was pleasantly surprised.Instead of the brash and rude approach to filming movies, that seems to be the standard today with effects driven movies, Terabithia focuses on the characters, the story, and the heart when telling this beautiful tale. Which, is part of the reason why I enjoyed it so much. Too often now days the story is built around the effects, not around the characters. A rather cumbersome and annoying way to tell a story, or be told a story, if you ask me. Instead, Terabithia uses the talents of both the amazing young actors, and its adult cast to enthrall and absorb the viewer in the magic of imagination and the reality of every-day life.The story focuses on young Jess Aarons, whose school life and home life aren't all that ideal. He deals with bullies at school, and four sisters at home. Josh Hutcherson, who I haven't particularly enjoyed before, plays the part of Jess perfectly, his emotions and reactions spot on, throughout.What is a school without the new girl? Leslie Burke, played by AnnaSophia Robb, takes on the part of the imaginative and friendly new girl and brings to Jess gifts of imagination and friendship. Robb truly does a superb job in bringing to life the thoughtful and imaginative Leslie Burke.All of the supporting cast was also brilliantly portrayed. I especially enjoyed the performances of Robert Patrick as Jess's father, and young Bailee Madison as Jess's little sister May Belle.Together, Jess and Leslie create a world to call their own. A place that no one else can get to, a place in their imaginations. Terabithia, a land of beautiful creatures and dangerous enemies, springs forth from their imaginations, and becomes a place to call their own, away from the bullies and monotony of everyday life.What really struck me as brilliant was the limited, yet still perfect number of glimpses into the children's' imaginations. We don't see a lot of Terabithia, which is good, because it is more about the journey of the characters, than the land of Terabithia. That said, it still has quite a few more scenes of adventure than the book by Katherine Patterson, all of which add to, not take away from the story.The writing, also is quite good. David Patterson, son of the novel's author takes great care when adapting the beloved work of his mother into a screenplay. Most of the lines from the book aren't there, but there are a few which make it in, revealing the care and love that was put into the scripting of this movie. Personally, I enjoy the screenplay of the movie more than the words of the book, but that is just my opinion. The movie's script greatly aided in the believability of the characters, and the motion of the scenes, which were crisp and well-planned.The movie touched on my every emotion, bringing me to tall peaks of happiness and leaving me teary-eyed and disconsolate, but still had a perfect and satisfying ending. I also, personally thought, the scenes and situations were more powerful, poignant, and realistic, than the book, which surprises me. Usually, the movie can't live up to the book. In this case, the phrase seemed switched around. The book didn't live up to the movie. As weird as it is for me to say this about a movie, Terabithia touched my heart like no film has ever before. And I doubt any film will give me quite the same feeling, ever again."
877,tt0398808,7,"When I sat down to watch Bridge to Terabithia, I did not know quite what to expect. From what I had seen in the trailers, I thought the movie would be about two kids that end up in some magical world, similar to the Chronicles of Narnia (clearly, I did not read the book). Needless to say that I was surprised when actually seeing the movie. I shall not spoil the story for those who have yet to see the movie, but I will say that, in my opinion, this movie is for a more mature audience than one would think. Rather than being a fairytale for youngsters, the movie actually gives the viewer an inside look in a young boy's life and all the troubles he faces, concerning school, family and friends. The setting overall was a lot darker than expected as well. I can be short about the acting. The child-stars that play the lead roles did a great job and really brought the characters to life. On this subject I must give some credit to the director as well, as it is very difficult to work with children and to get them to play the part exactly the way you want them too. One final aspect of the movie that deserves mentioning is the fact that it does not lean on special effects. Although there is a fair amount of nice CGI present in the film, the story dominates. Which in my opinion, is a lot better than the other way around. Overall, I found the movie very enjoyable, but I would advise parents of young children to find out more about the movie, before deciding on whether or not you'll let your kids watch it."
878,tt0398808,8,"A very well mastered family movie with a positive message that addresses topical themes for children in a poignant, focused manner. The children depicted are very real and likable (well, except for the ones you're supposed to dislike, that is), and easy to identify with. The movie is a faithful and touching adaptation of the beloved children's classic book.The two main characters, Jesse and Leslie (splendidly played by John Hucheson and Annasophia Robb) are typical pre-teens, steering their way through the routine ups and downs kids everywhere deal with, and they develop a friendship/first crush due to their common interests and challenges. They find an old tree house, and create a fantasy castle type kingdom complete with magic, and populated by creatures based on people they know. Unlike so many other fantasy movies, this world is just an amusement for them, not a refuge that they actually ""enter."" The animation effects of this fantasy kingdom are skillfully executed in such a manner as to point out the reality that exists alongside the fantasy. For example: a tree begins to move, comes to life and performs an action, then relaxes back into its ""real"" position.The relationships of all the characters, and what they learn from their experiences, are the true focus, with the fantasy sequences only spicing what's happening. There are many themes touched upon: friendship, tragedy, adventure, creativity, bullies, competition, family life, even making an enemy to a friend. I liked all the characters and the actors that played them; each person helped build the story. Emotional, even heart wrenching in one case, this movie is a gem. Highly recommended."
879,tt0398808,1,"When I heard back in August 2006 that they were making the award winning book ""Bridge to Terabithia"" into a movie, I immediately reread the book. But, it took my only a few hours, and I had months to wait. Today, February 16th, I saw it, and I have a few things all of you might want to know. This movie is very kid friendly, if you are very concerned about what your kids see, then, this might be good. There are a few imaginary ""scary"" figures, but it's not like a horror movie. The actors did so wonderfully well, it scares me. Josh Hutcherson and AnnaSophia were always favorites of mine, but they surprised me anyway. They played the roles well. It teaches you a lesson, also, and it shows some how to use an imagination. I thought this movie was marvelous, and it deserves to be watched by millions. It couldn't have done better."
880,tt0398808,9,"Great movie for all ages I took my five year old and fiancé they loved it.....Josh Hutcherson was great in this and so was Anna Sophia Robb .....People actually cried and clapped after the show it touches your inner child...It will take you through a life experience that not all kids go through in life but you will be absorbed in the film as I was...If you are looking for a great film instead of all the kids movies that rely on jokes that are used over and over ...go to this film and you will be satisfied with drama, light comedy and maybe slight depression of the reality it faces, but your spirit will be lifted as will your child's."
881,tt0398808,9,"Bridge To TerabithiaI have not read the book and did not see this movie with many expectations. To begin with, this is a story of Jesse Aarons (Josh Hutcherson). Jesse is the fastest runner in his class and very proud of being so. Frequently picked on by the local bullies, troubled with the financial situation back home and oft ignored by all but one of his 5 sisters, he immerses himself within his drawings as an escape... Leslie Burke (AnnaSophia Robb)is the new-kid in his class. She has a panache for writing which coupled by her ability to outrun all the guys in her class (including Jesse) ensures that she doesn't have the best luck making new friends. However, with their affinity to be picked on, Jesse and Leslie soon find themselves extremely fond of each other and off looking for a place of their own... This is Terabithia...And this is where I'll end my summary for I do not wish to go into the spoilers for the movie.All the kids in the movie really shine in their respective roles. As many reviewers have said before me, Josh and AnnaSophia are a wonderful pair! I would also like to mention the young Bailee Madison (playing Josh's younger sister) for her portrayal of May Belle. However, what truly lifts this movie from ""good"" to ""great"" is the simplicity of the whole story. This is a children's movie through and through and but do not expect a typical Disney feel-good comedy. Do not also expect huge CG sequences like say, The Chronicles of Narnia.This movie is full of heart and everything about it is shown from the eyes of a child. Life, is not a pretty thing and more than the magical kingdom of Terabithia, this is a tale of a young kids' coming to terms with matters of being bullied, being loved, having a true friend and even trying to understand death.By the end of it all, many people around me were moved to tears and I myself was trying desperately to hold back. The movie, its message and its delivery are all beautiful.On a critical note, the only thing about the movie that I didn't particularly love was the music. The music in general wasn't very well suited and certain songs were just not needed, but I suppose thats what the MTv culture demands.In conclusion, I highly recommend it. Go and watch this movie and if you have them, take your children... They'll love it!9/10"
882,tt0398808,8,"I have read about 30 reviews on here about this movie, many of them saying this film is not for kids. While I do understand where some parents may be coming from, I have to disagree. I personally read this book when I was in 5th grade. That was 11 years ago, yet somehow that book still sticks in my mind. I honestly had completely forgotten what the book was about, but I remember it being about two kids. Therefore, seeing the movie was like experiencing the story all over again. I DO think this is a good movie for children 10+. Like I already mentioned I was 11 when I read the book for the first time and I remember it having quite a positive impact on me. I didn't remember the novel or what it was about, however I did remember that it touched me in a way that very few books ever did. Kids 10+ need to see this movie.Death is not something to fear. It is just a passing from one stage in life to the next."
883,tt0398808,1,"I saw this film on January 23rd, 2007 in Indianapolis. I am one of the judges for the Heartland Film Festival's Truly Moving Picture Award. A Truly Moving Picture ""explores the human journey by artistically expressing hope and respect for the positive values of life."" Heartland gave that award to this film.This is a story of a poor 10-year old boy who wants to be the fastest boy in his class at school. To his surprise, the new girl who moves in next door to him beats him out fair and square and wins the race. This is no way to start a relationship or friendship.However, they have something in common. They are both being bullied at school. And they each react differently. The boy, Jesse, is passive and tries to stay out of harm's way. The girl, Leslie, is aggressive and challenges her tormentors. Who knows what the right way is to fight bullying, but they find their defense in friendship with each other. And, they find a wonderful way to experience this trying time in life via their vivid imagination and the creation of a magical and enchanting kingdom that is very real to them.They are both creative people. He is an artist and she is a writer. These creative people are able to close their eyes, picture another world, and keep their minds open to fantastic visions.But the bullying persists and they attempt to come to grips with their pain in various ways. They try to out smart their tormentors and do, but they don't enjoy being bullies and becoming like their enemies. This story is based on a Newbery-winning novel. It is a child's story. But, it is also a story for adults. It will bring you emotionally to your knees. It is lovingly and professionally told, and the fantasy part of the story  the magical kingdom  is wonderfully and briefly shown on the screen. This keeps the story grounded and believable.Jesse and Leslie are beautiful people regardless of their ages. They show us how to enjoy life, how to do the right things, how to be faithful to one's friends, and have hope for the future. We learn a lot from these ten year old children. FYI  There is a Truly Moving Pictures web site where there is a listing of past Truly Moving Picture Award winners that are now either at the theater or available on video."
884,tt0398808,8,"Bridge to Terabithia, based on the book, is a story about two kids, Jess and Leslie, who form a friendship over a shared outcast status at their school. Bullied, they seek their own refuge from the world in the form of their own kingdom, Terabithia.I read a comment about this movie not being for children, and I have to say, I totally disagree. I think this movie is wonderful for adults and children alike. It deals with some major issues in new and creative ways. Jess and Leslie deal with their problems by recreating them in an imaginary world where they can be the things they aren't in real life. This gives them the strength to deal with them in the real world.The more serious issues are handled in a way that parents can appreciate as not too ""adult"" for their children, and children as not too ""grown-up"" for them to grasp.Fans of the book will be happy to know that CGI effects do not overshadow the themes of the book, and though they make up a large part of the trailer, they actually make up less than a third of the movie.Kids and adults, be warned : bring the tissues."
885,tt0398808,1,"Saw the premiere and the movie has all the earmarks of a major hit. You never know for sure with American audiences but this is a very beautiful and engaging film. It REALLY outclasses any number of recent movies marketed at kids and it is one of the few I've seen that shows honest portrayals of both children and adults. No one, not even the bullies, is a stereotype or caricature. The novel is a masterpiece, but this film holds its own. With so many films, you walk out, whether amused or annoyed, and soon forget most of what you saw. Not so with Bridge--it stays with you, as it should. Go and enjoy...and then pass the word."
886,tt0396555,7,"The tagline of this movie is perfect... because it describes exactly what Meet the Robinsons means for the Disney Feature Animation studios... a step forward. Disney had been on a slide in the last few years... they were beginning to make cheap comedy movies with thin characters and story lines. I am happy to report that those days are over.Now, I'm sure many are wondering just what kind of influence John Lasseter has had on this film... and I can report that it is all positive. This movie could easily have been just as pointless as Chicken Little and The Wild... it could have been another thin comedy... but it wasn't. Here we finally have somewhat of a return to Disney's old style, where they make the audience laugh but also have a deep story with real-life problems and great characters. And I am happy to report that the humor is actually made with wit! There are no fart jokes, no potty humor, and the sidekick characters don't annoy the heck out of you.The first part of this movie, where we first see Lewis and Goob growing up at the orphanage, and then Lewis is whisked away to the future, is where all of my complaints lie. The beginning is very rushed, and does not give you a chance to really get to know Lewis or his feelings before he is whisked away into the future. And once he gets there, everything remains rushed. You meet the entire Robinson family in only about two minutes, and it's slightly overwhelming to have that much thrown at you. The opening of the future part is the part of the movie where you see what it COULD have been... a comedy that did nothing for you, and tried to overwhelm you with endless one-liners from wacky characters. But then the movie turns serious, the plot begins to unwind, and pace is much better. The characters become deeper and more realistic, their motivations and personalities shine through, and the storyline becomes absolutely fantastic. By the end of the movie, you really feel like you have been on an adventure. The main character shows hope, he develops and grows quite a bit through the course of the film, and there is a very uplifting message, from Walt Disney himself, to keep moving forward.So, overall, this is great family entertainment. The animation is quite good, much better than most other studios, but I don't think it's quite as great as some critics have made it out to be... maybe because I didn't get to see the 3-D version. But for me, it was the story that made the movie. Combine the great story, witty humor, and fun animation, and you have a movie that is definitely a step in the right direction for Disney. The motto could not be better placed... keep moving forward, and keep looking for better and better films from Walt Disney Pictures in the future."
887,tt0396555,7,"I'm writing reviews for a German movie website and thus got into a press screening of the new CG animated Disney movie ""Meet the Robinsons"" in Munich a little while ago. I'm a big animation fan myself and love many of the old Disney movies, although lately I've been more impressed with Pixar's films than anything Disney had to offer in the last few years. However, the story of this one is actually quite interesting and not as uninspired and generic as Disney's last traditionally animated feature Home on the Range or as messy as their first CG outing Chicken Little. It offers a number of nice surprises and even a good plot twist or two without causing too much of the old time-traveling headache. The humor also works quite well, although many of the jokes seem to be aimed at adults and little kids might not get all of them. (Didn't bother me, though) Most importantly, this film does not contain a single fart joke nor any talking animals or even animal sidekicks (except for those singing frogs you might have seen in the trailers, but they're really not the same thing). I don't know how close this adaptation is to William Joyce's novel ""A Day With Wilbur Robinson"", as I've never read anything Joyce has written, but it all works pretty well and manages to be an exiting and entertaining family adventure movie.One aspect of the movie that works particularly well is the design. The buildings, machines and landscapes of the future really look totally cool and have a very own look that is inspired by Joyce's illustrations and various visions of the future from the 50ies and 60ies. They're beautifully rendered, too. Furthermore, the animation is pretty awesome. The movements of the quirky characters are very fast but funny and cleverly stylized. The best example for this is the Bowler Hat Guy who moves in a unique style that makes him look like a giant Spider. This really is a welcome change from the hyper-realistic motion capturing stuff we've been seeing in a lot of movies lately. The character design isn't so bad either. However, the humans don't look quite as good as the ones in The Incredibles, the stylization of some characters makes them look a little too artificial for my taste. The voice-acting, which relies on solid voice actors and luckily doesn't involve any fancy stunt casting, leaves nothing to be desired. Danny Elfman's score is pretty fine, too. I could have done without the cheesy pop songs that were played at some parts of the film, though.Altogether, I highly recommend seeing this warmhearted family film to any animation fan. It might not be as good as my Pixar favorites The Incredibles and Finding Nemo, but it sure is a lot better than most of the other studios' wisecracking-and-farting-animal flicks. With Pixar's John Lasseter pulling the strings at Disney's animation unit now, they finally seem to be getting back on the right track and I'm looking forward to their next projects, especially the traditionally animated The Frog Princess.One last thing: as some of you might have heard, Disney wants to start putting original animated shorts in front of their feature films again. Meet the Robinsons kind of makes a start by showing the old Mickey, Donald & Goofy short Boat Builders in the beginning. It's a great experience to see one of those on the big screen again and the kids in the audience apparently loved it."
888,tt0396555,8,"I went to the theater this afternoon to catch an R-rated film and goofed on the times. The only movie available in my time frame allowed was Meet the Robinsons. I reluctantly bought a ticket and was pleasantly rewarded with a movie experience that reminded me very much of my childhood. When we got to go to the movies in the 50's and 60's, there were trailers, followed by the newsreel and then a cartoon before the main attraction. The non-three D version started with non-R rated trailers, followed by a Mickey Mouse cartoon (loved it!) and then the main feature. It was very entertaining to sit back and relax and not worry about the good guys dying, the amount of slaughter that would be portrayed, or that there wouldn't be a positive message at the end. As an adult, there were enough references to keep me entertained and from the sounds of the kids in the theater, they were obviously enjoying this movie. I would highly recommend it to all but the crankiest movie-goers, and I personally loved the quote from Uncle Walt at the end of the movie. When I was little, our whole family watched Walt Disney every Sunday and I particularly remember when it changed to Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color. Walt Disney was a man ahead of his time and I really miss his adventurous spirit and inquisitive mind. He introduced and ended each episode and I really enjoyed seeing him every week. I wish that Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color was still on every week and that new episodes would still be made."
889,tt0396555,1,"Somewhere Walt Disney must be smiling. ""Meet the Robinsons"" is the perfect, unlikely marriage of manic, absurd humor, eye-popping visuals and honest-to-goodness emotional depth. It is a close cousin to the first ""Back to the Future,"" yet it feels completely original at the same time. The 3-D animation works seamlessly within the story. It is not played for a cheesy gimmick (like, for example, ""Spy Kids 3-D""...groan). In fact, it is so well integrated into the narrative that you could almost take it for granted, so it's a good thing that at the heart of ""Meet the Robinsons"" there is a wonderfully entertaining story. In typical Disney fashion the central character is a motherless (and in this case, fatherless) youth -- however this time it is not merely a device whose sole purpose is to leave him unencumbered to embark on his own adventure. In fact, his orphaned status and quest to find the mother that left him at the orphanage as a baby IS the point of his journey. But there's no room for sugary sap here, thanks to an almost unending stream of quirky characters and plot twists. Of course stories like this can't succeed without a great villain. In this case the filmmakers have managed to craft a bumbling villain who is simultaneously hilarious, sympathetic and just menacing enough to keep the tension going. He reminded me of Snidely Whiplash, Mack the Knife, and the magician from Rankin-Bass' ""Frosty the Snowman,"" all rolled into one.This movie has all the seat-of-your-pants fun of a great amusement park ride and still manages to make you (well...me) cry at the end. The deft combination of love and laughs results in a movie that stays with you well after the lights have come up, leaving you wanting more. It is rare nowadays for and entire audience of moviegoers to spontaneously burst into applause at the end, but that's what occurred when the credits began to roll for this film. ""Meet the Robinsons"" is loaded with enough heart, rapid fire jokes and blink-and-you'll-miss-them sight gags to make it worth repeated viewings. We can't wait for the eventual DVD release -- hopefully in 3-D. Come to think of it, we REALLY can't wait, so we're going to see it again on the big screen."
890,tt0396555,7,"I saw an advance screening of 'Meet The Robinsons' today with the family and all of us thoroughly enjoyed it. After getting a bit sick of recent CGI animal flicks (with the possible exception of Flushed Away), this was a refreshing change.An intriguing storyline revolves around orphan Lewis who, as a 12-year old, is an up-and-coming inventor, and dreams of building a time machine to find out who his mother was. He meets a mysterious boy Wilbur Robinson who tries to save him from the equally mysterious man with the bowler hat. We are then drawn into a time travel story that, while having as many paradoxes as Back To The Future, ends with some interesting plot twists.We saw the movie in 3D - and while there were a few ""especially for 3D"" visual effects, such as flying food - the 3D was not overdone and did not detract from the story."
891,tt0396555,1,"Outside of the beautiful faces that I helped to create and another that made an honest man of me...I truly loathe most everything that passes as...anything, truly. I took two of my sons and a young friend of theirs to see Meet The Robinsons, today. Having never wanted to shout anything from a mountain top - let me just offer up a piece of advice for anyone looking for something uplifting, inspirational - heartbreaking but re-affirming...you must see this movie. I'm a braveheart guy, I love goodfellas and Will Ferrell movies - I'm an idiot; but I can't imagine hearing more beautiful words come out of my sons mouth than when we left the theatre and hearing him say ""that movie made me feel good about myself"". Poetry - from the mouth and mind of someone who doesn't know any better - or any worse. The movie is about - and this isn't a spoiler - family and caring for someone other than yourself. It isn't standard Disney stuff - even though that sounds EXACTLY like standard Disney. I'm running out space and I'm not completely making the most sense which is exactly how I feel at 37 anyway....Do me a favor, do your drive to work tomorrow morning a favor...go see this movie. Take an extra second in the morning to smell your kids, kiss your spouse and lay off your horn...it's nice every once in a while to leave something...inspired, and feeling ""really good about yourself"" - even for just a second."
892,tt0396555,8,"Was a little ""ify"" about taking my 5 and 2 year old daughter's to this movie. Actually was concerned that it may not hold their attention. Based on some reviews, I honestly didn't think I would care for it.Being a huge fan of Disney's work, but seeing their young target audience erode to the digital-only studios, I was hoping they'd come back to strong story lines.Well, Meet the Robinsons was a surprise to me. Had a great story line, extremely visually appealing, awesome voicing (I do professional voice work so have a different appreciation for this), and an all-round great movie.The only negative thing I must say (without spoiling the movie) is that when it came down to the part of the movie where it changes and you see much more of the hat in the future (again, don't worry.. no spoiler in this info) both of my daughters were pretty frightened and jumped to my lap. The visuals and content during this part of the movie really took on a different edge (color/music changes, etc.) As far as making it to frightening, I would hate in retrospect to see it changed to be a little more ""small kid friendly"". I would say that it might be a much better movie for children over 7 or 8 to see. I have to say again that as an adult, I thought it was really great.One of the features of this movie I thought was clearly outstanding was the musical composition (and songs) that Danny Elfman (Nightmare, Corpse Bride, Simpsons, and a million other compositions) did. One particular song is such an awesome, up-beat, fun song that I really hope Disney puts a push behind it to give it radio airplay. (I'm also a former radio jock in Dover, Athens, Akron, Cleveland, Denver, Fort Collins, and Madrid-Spain) Certainly Elfman has written some great and memorable music (""What's This? - Nightmare Before Christmas), but I'd have to say the music in Robinsons is some of his finest.I'd sum this all up in saying that, like the Disney tradition, this is story with great writing, great music, a lesson to be learned, and fun in general. It might be a little too much for the very little kids (even Beauty & The Beast or Aladdin had parts that could be frightening to very little kids though). I get (and hope) that Disney stays on the course they've moved with Robinsons. It's nice to see Disney getting back to their roots for story telling, yet moving forward (Shrek-like) with their animation and modern feel.On a side-note: Ironically, the new opening cartoon (Mikey, Donald & Goofy build a boat cartoon) was made to feel very old by Disney. Audio was clearly intentionally ""warbled"" (for old-time 1920's/1930's affect). It was shot in 4x4 ration (not TV's 4x3 or Cinemascope) And drawn images were full of dirt-type flaws (specs that were on their drawings and not on the lens of the camera or projector and they ""jumped"" throughout the short cartoon). Very tradition cartoon which traces back to the Walt Disney roots. Wondered if it hadn't been placed to really show the contrast of the original Disney and the new Disney."
893,tt0396555,8,"The Robinsons is a one weird family. It takes time to know them, and once you do, you will like them.They come from the future, filled with colourful buildings, flying jets, travelling tubes that would remind you of the Jetsons. Everyone is strange in their own way, from Frannie who conducts frog band, Grandpa who wears his clothes backward and twins Dimitri and Spike who stay in flower pots. Plus a talking robot like C-3PO.In Back to the Future style, 13th year old Wilbur Robinson brings a smart nerd Lewis to 2037 to recover his invention. Are you lost yet? Now, all these eccentric characters and story can be quite hard to understand. Everything happens so fast, so don't lose your attention.Once you get past the initial stage, everything falls nicely into place like a jigsaw in this intricate story. Although there isn't one main character who will appeal to you like The Incredibles, the whole Robinsons family will charm you the same.Some critics may say: Too many characters. Too much dialogue. Too confusing. Too many things happening at the same time. Indeed, there were points where young children may go ""huh?"". Nevertheless, the singing frogs, big-headed dinosaur, colourful setting and music from Danny Elfman makes it all quite likable.With a strong ""keep moving forward"" educational message and a touching ending, this animation is recommended to families who will continue to enjoy this work from Disney.(As a bonus, audience will also be brought back in time with a nostalgic cartoon featuring Mickey, Donald and Goofy)http://themovieclub.blogspot.com"
894,tt0396555,9,"A heartwarming story with eye-popping 3D special effects. If you have the option of seeing this in 3D, you should opt for it. The story is strong, so you will enjoy it either way, but since 3D is a rare instance in this day & age, you should go that route. This movie has a stellar cast that may not be the big A-list names like the Dreamworks movies, but they are very talented and well cast in their roles. I prefer the subtlety of casting for quality versus stunt casting, and this movie delivered. You can tell that John Lasseter played an important role in this movie - ""Cars"" delivered the message that the journey is more important than the destination and ""Meet the Robinsons"" delivers a message about not living in the past...keep moving forward. John Lasseter should be commended for helping lift Disney features back to their glory days. I will be the first to admit that they are not there yet, but with his help and movies that focus on the story & the characters like ""Meet the Robinsons"", we won't have long to wait..."
895,tt0396555,1,"""Meet the Robinsons"" is just superb in every way - plot, animation, characters, substance, and music. All put together in an astoundingly gorgeous film - easily enjoyed by ALL ages. Clever, clever humor and wit - many things that only adults may understand. Loved the way the story progresses and how it ends.Love the music. Gorgeous ""Little Wonders"" by the fantastic Rob Thomas played at the end coordinated with the story ending - beautifully done. And the phenomenal Jamie Cullum doing 2 great songs for Frankie the Frog - 2 bouncy songs, done to perfection by a great artist. Enjoyed Rufus Wainwright's songs - fit in well with the story. And, Danny Elfman's score is wonderful. So, I also highly recommend the soundtrack!!! I really do not have enough superlatives for this movie. It could be my favorite Disney film, (and I've seen them all). I definitely plan on seeing it again in 3-D. But, even in 2-D, it is not to be missed!!"
896,tt0449088,8,"This third installment is just as long, fixes some of the damages but adds along new ones. At Worlds End improves on its CGI magic but still possesses that dragging story that is just too long and confusing."
897,tt0449088,7,"AWE was a decent close to the trilogy (although they did leave it open for the possibility of a 4th).Lets go down the list: 1) Holy cow. The CGI is breathtaking. The details on the sets is just as breathtaking. The filming sites were beautiful. These are a talented group of folks I tell ya. GREAT job.2) Acting .. both good and bad. Sparrow, Barbossa, Beckett, Norrington, Jones, and Gibbs provided some very good acting and funny moments. However, they were offset by Pintel and Ragetti (they got annoying in the 2nd film and it didn't stop here. While I enjoyed the idea of Tia Dalma's character, I wasn't impressed with the performance by beautiful Miss Harris. I haven't especially liked Keira all that much in other things she has done and it was the same here. Decent actress but not overly impressive. Stellan's portrayal of Bill Turner was decent enough but a notch down from what we KNOW he can do. Now the best for last. Im a 100% hetero male and even I can say that Orlando Bloom is a VERY good looking guy. But for the love of pete, this guy is one of the most terrible actors ever and strangely, he was cast in two of the biggest, most profitable trilogies ever. He has essentially played the same character in every movie, just with different costumes. His mannerisms, his low ""sexy"" voice, his facial expressions .. ALLLL the same, all the time. Sooo blahhhhhhh.3) The story was good but there was too much of it. It has been said here but I will say it again. At one point, I just stopped trying to follow along and just enjoyed it. Everyone stabbed everyone else in the back at least once. It wasn't ""hard to follow"" but a movie like this isn't supposed to make you think. You want that, go see .... Clue :P the whole Singapore thing was just unneeded. While it did add a new element to the film, it just seemed too forced.4) Running time was a tad bit long but it passed fairly quickly due to the great action sequences.All in all .. I was impressed with the movie, but it has its problems. Much like part 2.I say go and see it. You wont be disappointed but you wont walk out thinking you just saw a masterpiece either.Just my thoughts ..."
898,tt0449088,8,"The more I think about this movie, the more I like it. This is strange, considering my low expectations. The first film was fun, and I was very happy to see swashbuckling returning to movies, but I never really bought into the script. I wasn't convinced that pirates were some sort of blood-bound ""race"", and I was powerfully confused by the distance between and physical relationships of various locations. But, still good fun. The second film just kind of made me mad; I loved the ending, but it was just one example of how much it was a standard sequel: every single quirk of the first film was referenced, every single character had to return, and it HAD to be structured - nay, plotted - like Empire Strikes Back. This included re-introducing the Han Solo-Leia love story where the female lead wants the anti-hero, just to appease all the screaming Johnny Depp fans. It begged to be liked, but aside from a great score, great effects, and some very funny moments, it just came off as trite.And then we get At World's End, which has everything you could possibly want in a pirate fantasy film: Legendary ships riddling each other with cannon fire in a whirlpool, screaming buccaneers swinging from one ship to the next, sword-fights on crow's nests, and all that in about fifteen minutes. The rest is an admittedly convoluted story that is much more clearly plotted than the second film, while still taking breaks for letting us spend time with characters we weren't so sure about last time, but are once again fond of. Maybe it's Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa, or the overall simplicity of the plot, but it just worked, and I had a great time.I was legitimately surprised and concerned at what the plot did with our heroes and villains, and was very satisfied with everyone's status in the end. I guess I wouldn't mind seeing another Pirates movie now, but I kind of think everything that needs to be done is in this film.I can't wrap up without mentioning the very nice abstract stuff Verbinksi and co. did with the journey to Davey Jones' Locker. It takes guts to do really surreal stuff with a $300 million Happy Meal blockbuster, but they really did some new, interesting things with their bottomless bag of tricks.A- Curse of the Black Pearl: B+ Dead Man's Chest: B"
899,tt0449088,9,"I'm a huge fan of the Piates of the Caribbean movies, but I was a little nervous about seeing this third installment because of the not as good other third installments. I still had pretty high expectations, and I was not disappointed! The plot was brilliant and very creative, with plenty of exciting twists and turns. As always, the acting was incredible. Johnny Depp always does an amazing job, but his Captain Jack Sparrow is probably one of his bests works yet! I still don't see how anyone could be so brilliant... Anyways, overall, just a really great film. Better than the other Pirate films in the trilogy (and you know how good those are!) See it, you won't be disappointed!"
900,tt0449088,1,"(contains spoilers... but trust me, that won't matter).it's safe to say that Johnny Depp single-handily made the 'pirate' series a success. if not for Depp telling interviewers Keith Richards inspired his captain jack-isms, Keith Richards would certainly not have appeared in the 3rd movie. in between the excessive amount of canon balls/sword fights scenes, i couldn't wait to get home and tear this movie to shreds. it's such an easy formula: three parts jack sparrow, eleven parts talking about jack sparrow, two parts love stories, six parts pirate ships emerging from water, five parts capturing, five parts rescuing and ten parts action/violence/sword fights. mix haphazardly against elaborate sets and computer graphics. let set for three hours until the audience rises.the movie could be broken down into FOUR major flaws:POOR WRITING. it seemed the writers were very aware that audiences were only going to see 'Pirates' for Jack Sparrow, so they thought... ""hmmm, if people love Jack so much... they'll love THREE jacks, or FOUR jacks, or even MORE Jacks!!"" so they made scenes reminiscent of Alice in Wonderland where Jack hallucinates and sees many of himself. the mood and overall appearance of these scenes drastically contrast with the mood and overall appearance of the film. for a minute i thought i was watching an Oompa Loompa scene from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.TOO MANY CHARACTERS: accompanying poor writing was the addition of too many characters. in a nutshell: jack's crew (which was two crews combined), the British crew, the squid's crew, and a new Asian crew all have different agendas that (of course) require the other crews to be killed. Elizabeth (Knightly) becomes captain of the Asian crew, Orlando bloom becomes captain of the squid crew and Jack bounces between every crew as he is traded and captured for deal-making. Orlando bloom's character wants to free his father, Jack wants to be immortal, Kiera Knightly's character wants to be with Orlando Bloom again, the squid wants the sea goddess, Elizabeth wants to kill the British captain for killing her father, the British crew wants jack dead and the Asian crew wants to be a part of whichever crew is getting the treasure. but is there even treasure?!! the object they're all after is a beating heart. and yes, it's as confusing as it sounds.OLD JOKES. just like the second, all of the ""comedic"" moments in the third movie relied on recycled material from the first movie. the humor in 'pirates' can be attributed to six subjects: 1) the wooden eye: kudos to whoever thought to give that guy a wooden eye because you added 30 pages of plot to each film!! 2) jack, the monkey: the only character whose acting improved by the third film. he's also in a lot more of the scenes in the third movie. my boyfriend thought he was the best part. and he was right. 3) rum jokes: the first movie relied heavily on rum jokes. since the third movie didn't know what the hell it was doing, it hit up the booze too. 4) the sexual tension between jack and elizabeth. the cliché ""trust me, it would have never worked between us..."" lines return again. 5) jack getting slapped: yes, women love to slap jack sparrow. we got that one already, thanks. 6) sheer stupidity/slapstick humor: the other nanoseconds of anticipated (but unreceived) humor relied on the dumb antics of the fat guy and the skinny guy with the wooden eye. CONFUSING PLOT. it felt as though the writers made this movie up as they were filming it and when they were running low on plot someone said, ""i know, let's make one of the crew members turn out to be a sea goddess!!"" and since there are only two female main characters (one being Kiera Knightly), the Jamaican-sounding chick landed the role of sea goddess. this made the plot entertaining for about 20 seconds when the Jamaican chick turned into the 50 ft. woman and started talking like the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man and then exploded into millions of crabs at which point i leaned over to my boyfriend and said, ""haha, she had crabs!!"" needless to say, i don't plan on seeing the 4th or 5th or 6th Pirates movie. but i will be curious to see if Depp stays aboard. bottom line: if you were planning on seeing pirates, go see Waitress instead. written by: Jena Ardell"
901,tt0449088,4,"It was very disappointing.I adored the first movie to pieces. I own the DVD and regularly play it on movie nights with my friends. It's great unexpected fun, quotable, and a visual spectacle. The characters are surprisingly likable, and Depp comes roaring in like a breath of fresh air as Capt. Jack.The problem with the third movie (as well as the second) is that it lost touch with it's roots. The first movie, while heavy with the supernatural stuff, was still pretty grounded in a fairly accurate real world. The characters were over the top, yes, but still believable, and above all, relatable. Their motives and predicaments all made a great deal of sense (i.e. Elizabeth wanting to marry Will, Barbossa wanting to be free of the curse, Jack simply wanting to get a boat so he could live his life of freedom). Unfortunately, in the new movies, the writers have lost touch with the first movie's charm. The plots are so convoluted it's difficult to decipher, much less remember, a character's desires and motives. It's much less emotionally grounded. It has also become so thick into this supernatural fantasy land that it has hardly any link to the real world at all. This would not have been a problem were the filmmakers not so intent on special effects and visual spectacles that they forgot to tell a good, solid story.I believe this movie would have been better if the writers had kept to a more straightforward plot and toned down much of the ""grand spectacle"" stuff which really dominated the movies."
902,tt0449088,7,"Less than a year after the previous installment of the popular pirates trilogy, Jack Sparrow and company return in Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End. The film should be great, given a three hundred million dollar budget, huge anticipation, and the closure a third installment inevitably brings to a series. While this film does show its budget and is quite visually arresting, it lacks a fair share of resolution to the trilogy and confuses with its overflowing exposition rather than purely existing to entertain.Even in an action packed pirate movie, overly chatty sequences will simply bore audiences just because it's too hard to follow what exactly is being said. The movie really just had too many vague or unnecessary plot points that didn't affect the main plot at hand.All the acting was perfectly fine, with Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow and Geoffrey Rush as Captain Barbosa unsurprisingly being the standouts. The introduction of Depp's character in the pirate equivalent of Hell called Davy Jones' Locker is a particular favorite, as well as the scenes at World's End, which somehow involves a giant, deep waterfall. Keith Richards' hyped cameo as Jack's father is nothing to go crazy for, he does a decent job, but his screen time lasts only about two minutes.Director Gore Verbinski and his crew knew going into this that the reviews would be mixed and the plot would be confusing (in order to encourage repeat viewings), but honestly, at nearly three hours, the more the film confuses you the more it becomes an endurance test. Also, rather than providing a satisfying conclusion to the series, the end opens up the possibility for a fourth installment, which might not even happen. The crew put every penny of the film's budget on screen, made evident in the hour or so of its bloated climax. The film looks and feels like a true epic, shots are wide, locations are vast, costumes are extravagant, and the scope is large. However, the film needs to scale down its plot in order to let the characters we fell in love with stand out and shine, as that's what makes these films unique."
905,tt0449088,9,"I adored POTC 1, was a bit disappointed in POTC 2 (mainly the ending) and found POTC 3 to be a mix of the previous two. The awesome music is still in place, it's a bit faster paced than 2 (even with sections of dialogue in place), and the majority of characters get their come-uppance. There's heaps of sword fights and more cannons than I've seen in my life. The special effects are seamless and mix with great cinematography and top notch costumes & makeup. Many characters are more fully fleshed out, which was nice to see.However the ending is NOT pure Disney, which surprised me somewhat. Major characters die, and all is not rosy sunsets and fluffy kittens. That was a bit of a surprise, a couple of characters seemed to just disappear and there's an obvious link left open for another movie. Whether it's made or not is another thing entirely (and unlikely from what I hear).One more point... stay until the end of the credits for an interesting extra scene."
906,tt0382932,1,"That's what the food critic, Anton Ego, says in his review of the movie's restaurant at the end of the movie. That is a good way to sum up Ratatouille.This movie released a few days after my 9th birthday. My Grandma got the DVD and I loved it. I was a kid and animated movies were my jam! I even taped a Disney Channel showing on a record-able VHS. I have seen this numerous times, and I still love it. I just saw it again as a 20 year old and it still puts me in awe.The movie is about Remy, a rat who has an obsession with food, cooking, and the humans who cook food. He meets a chef who can't cook very well, and he uses his talent to secretly help him. But that causes issues with a secret rat in a failing restaurant.I can't think of a single flaw with this movie.The animation is beautiful(I noticed one car that almost looked real at one point)and the story is well told.I know when I love a movie when I feel this thrill in my heart and an excitement along with it.(See my review of Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King) I felt that all throughout this movie, even though I have seen this movie numerous times.This is an animated movie where you don't need to be a kid to enjoy it. (Roger Ebert said this as well.) Anton Ego also says that he will return to the restaurant ""hungry for more."" Revisiting this as an adult makes me say the same thing about the movie he is in.Edit: Nearly 11 months later, 7/7 people found the review helpful. I appreciate the positive feedback from everyone!

907,tt0382932,1,"In many ways, the work of a critic is easy. We risk very little, yet enjoy a position over those who offer up their work and their selves to our judgment. We thrive on negative criticism, which is fun to write and to read. But the bitter truth we critics must face is that, in the grand scheme of things, the average piece of junk is probably more meaningful than our criticism designating it so...This movie is perfect. This movie is the reason why I write movie reviews. This movie helped me appreciate effort and art. This movie helped me defeat my prejudices against things I don't really know.It is a perfect kids movie, it is a perfect adult movie. Most Pixar movies actually contain very mature messages and this movie's message, ""anyone can cook"" is why we watch movies. Movies are meant to inspire the audience and this movie does a great job. Show this to a kid, they will watch it over and over again. I know because I used to watch this movie every single day.This is not Remy's movie, this is not Linguini's movie, this is definitely not Gusteau's movie. This is Anton Ego's movie. The character development of Anton Ego is phenomenal. We see an arrogant critic become a humble and honest person, and it is what we should become at the end of the day. Most of us start out as arrogant and we do not appreciate effort and talent. However we must learn to give credit where it is due. We see Ego's journey in becoming this modest person, he changes for the better.The final scene is one I cannot praise enough. Seeing Ego complete his arc This movie is an inspiring masterpiece, something we really need in the movie industry today.Maybe I highly rate this movie because of my memories watching it. The scene where he tastes the ratatouille is exactly how I felt re-watching this movie. When I rewatched this movie I experienced something new, an appreciation of kids movies and their messages. This movie changed my whole perception on animated movies. Today, most movies are cash grabs produced with the sole purpose of making profit from tickets and action figures. We need more movies like Ratatouille in this world. In this critic's opinion, this movie is nothing less than the finest movie in history."
908,tt0382932,1,"Remember how everyone was talking about Toy Story when it first came out? The incredible visuals, unique style, vividly imagined world? The next time people were talking that way with such enthusiasm about a computer animated movie was Finding Nemo. I'm excited to say that Ratatouille will be the next one to redefine the visual creativity and technical detail of computer animated movies. Honest to goodness, I was awestruck by the animation, and that never happens to me. It is a visual masterpiece of a movie if ever the term applies.The next thing to talk about is the ""genre"" of the movie. As Pixar enthusiasts will tell you, Brad Bird, the director of Ratatouille, also directed The Incredibles, which has the most inspired and creative action sequences from any of the Pixar movies. Ratatouille, while not so straightforward with its action, has almost as much as The Incredibles did, in unique ways. Most memorable is the shotgun scene near the beginning. (You'll know what I'm talking about when you see it). Other than that, this is the expected comedy-with-heart movie from Pixar that so many have grown to love.The voice acting? Spot on. Every voice is distinctive, and it never feels like a celebrity's voice tacked on to a character (Shrek, I'm looking at you), it feels like the characters themselves speaking. You can't ask for more from voice acting.And finally, the script and the story. The entire irony of the story -- a street rat with a passion for fine food -- is beautiful, and a tight, smart, wonderful script flows from this. The pacing of the story is odd and choppy at places, but this is a very forgivable grievance. The only other minor fault is that a few of the dramatic one-liners feel a bit forced. Other than that, this is the most layered, complex, and satisfying script from Pixar since The Incredibles.Overall, I recommend that everyone see this movie when it hits theaters (I was lucky enough to see a pre-release screening). Though not perfect, it is an animated masterpiece in true Pixar form with breathtaking animation and visual design.10/10"
909,tt0382932,1,"Tonight I went to see Ratatouille during a preview offered to Myspace users in Boston. Overall the movie was GREAT! It was really funny, often in unexpected places, the storyline kept you engaged the entire time and the overall mood was lighthearted and inspiring. A real ""feel-good"" movie. I admit I was a bit skeptical going in, I mean the idea of a rat in a kitchen kind of left me queasy, but I left the theater excited to see it again when it is released. The voice actors are excellent and the animation is amazing. I've been to Paris before and the overall views were very accurate. At times I could tell exactly where in the city the events were taking place. Overall a fabulous movie, I highly recommend it!"
910,tt0382932,1,"I checked out a sneak preview of Ratatouille last night, and I must say I truly loved this movie. Everything from the animation to the score to the voice acting to the story (and especially the story) was EXCELLENT.I don't know if it appeals to kids as much as other Pixar offerings, but this one upholds their legacy of excellence.Casting Patton Oswalt as Remy was PERFECT. The rest of the voice cast was outstanding as well...including Pixar ""house voice"" John Ratzenberger. See if you can tell which guy he is without foreknowledge (as in, don't read the cast list).Michael Giacchino's score was as perfect for this story as the award-winning one he created for ""The Incredibles"" and the incredible music he has created for most of J.J. Abrams' recent projects, including ""Alias"" and ""Lost"". Even with my 3-year-old son making it really hard to concentrate, and our ""we got to the theater late and had to sit up front"" seats, this movie was fantastic. Everyone should go see it, even if they don't have kids.Brad Bird - you done right by us movie fans again...Ratatouille is great!"
911,tt0382932,1,"Fantastic ! ... Can't wait to get the DVD ! The technical / animation / lighting ..etc aspects of the film are awesome. Pixar has raised the bar again.The best thing about the movie, is that it showcases Pixar's ""mantra"" , that being story, story ...story. That along with having great characters/animation/dialog, which you just forget ... or never even consider are digital puppets.The humor was great too, the gags / situations character acting all contributing to making situations that ""kids of all ages "" could ""get"".There is on one level the entire story, of Remy and Linguini, but then there are 3 or 4 or more subplots and a number of dramatic scene changes which almost felt like separate chapters of the main story. That all contributed ..for me at least... to keeping the movie very interesting right to the end.While I found a few things predictable, there were also quite a few twists and and unexpected events / scenes, that just kept giving me more new ""stuff"" to enjoy 10 / 10 Mike"
912,tt0382932,1,"I caught a sneak peak yesterday, and must say, this film is a classic. It is not as flashy as cars, or as action packed as Incredibles, but it is a masterpiece of restraint and heart, that matches the classics from the golden age of the film industry. Pixar has always been groundbreaking for smart and fun animated features, but Ratatouille might just be what puts them over the top as one of the BEST all around film-making teams in history.Ratatouille is a treat for film lovers. It feels like a classic. The animationis absolutely beautiful, especially the scenery of Paris which evoked awes from the audience, as if we were seeing a grandiose fireworks show.The story is oh so classy and universal, especially when you look at it as a parable to yourself and society. Sometimes the story seems familiar, yet it is packed with so much genuine heart and individuality, that it might even be too ""indie"" for most audiences. But those who are patient and willing to open their minds and hearts, even when it may challenge the viewers to rethink their own personal biases, will find within this entertaining, sweet, simple film a remarkable message about challenging societal norms and not letting anything stand in your way of your dreams. When you follow your dreams, you never know what an impact it will have upon you, or those you might encounter on the journey. Just see the film, and be open to its message, and I am sure if you allow it too, it will touch you as well.P.S. : The short in front of the feature is the funniest animated short film pixar has ever done, so even if ratatouille might not be as flashy as many might want it to be, the short film will have everyone in stitches, as it did our entire theater. So just go and see it, and be prepared for a wonderful two hours."
913,tt0382932,1,"This film is fantastic! Pixar has yet another great film to add to their impressive repertoire. Oscar-winning director and screenwriter Brad Bird, who wrote and directed ""The Incredibles"", has produced a film with subtle humor, heart, and very profound truth. The voice actors are so great, and it is especially great to hear Peter O'Toole on the screen. The animation is beautiful and it is all around an excellently made film. Its message is one that holds so much truth for everyone, especially today's youth: it tells people that no, not anyone can do anything, but if you have the talent you don't have to be limited by your surroundings or your upbringing. I think this is refreshing to hear because often, children are lied to when they are told they can do anything, when actually not all of them can. But it offers hope to the ones who may feel limited by their social class. It also exposes the fact that most people try to put up false facades of themselves to hide who they are in order to feel accepted by the social standards we create in our society; it shows characters with this flaw, but ultimately they accept this reality and learn to be true to themselves. This thread, I think, is very common throughout the Pixar films, and they present it very well. ""Ratatouille"" is my new Disney-Pixar favorite! ""Ce film a pleine de joie de vivre!"""
914,tt0382932,1,"The combination of Disney and Pixar never ceases to amaze, but with Ratatouille, their newest effort, animated features are brought to new heights with the best one to date. Ratatouille is stunning, surreal while at the same time realistic, and a joy to watch. The writing is, in one word, just amazing, and the voice acting is sensational. The characters are poetic and real, and the rats are some of Disney/Pixar's cutest creations. Ratatouille is written and directed by Brad Bird (The Incredibles), and features stellar voice acting from Peter O'Toole, Patton Oswalt, Ian Holm, Brian Dennehy, Lou Romano, Brad Garrett, and Janeane Garofalo.Remy (voiced by Patton Oswalt) is a little rat who dreams of becoming a chef just like his idol, the human Gusteau (voiced by Brad Garrett). After a mishap, Remy loses his family in the sewers and comes upon a fading restaurant that had previously been owned by Gusteau before his untimely death. He comes upon a lowly garbage boy, Linguini (voiced by Lou Romano), and together they set out to revive the once-legendary restaurant.Ratatouille is filled with loads of surprises and lots of twists and turns. The animation is even more stunning here than in some of the other Disney/Pixar productions, and the breathtaking landscape of Paris, France, really adds a layer of realism to the film. The food looks so real and delicious, and the humans and rats look incredibly realistic. Remy and Linguini are both lovable characters, and the audience is rooting for them the entire way. Surprisingly enough, this movie is the funniest of the Disney/Pixar films, with very subtle and unique humor.As previously stated, the voice acting really makes the film different, and each actor is perfectly suited to his or her role. The best among the bunch happens to be Lou Romano, as he deals with his character extremely well and is incredibly believable. There are times when the acting and animation is so excellent that you forget you are watching an animated film altogether. Brad Garrett is actually tolerable for once, and is excellent in his role as Gusteau, who acts as Remy's conscience for the majority of the film. Some of the funniest scenes in the movie are rooted from Gusteau's chats with Remy and many others come from the relationship between Linguini and Remy. On another note, Patton Oswalt does a magnificent job voicing Remy, and Peter O' Toole is very memorable as Anton Ego, the food critic for 'The Grim Eater'.Overall, you can't ask for a better film than Ratatouille, a new classic from Disney/Pixar that is filled with humor, amazing animation, and, most importantly, lots of heart. Some of the scenes are so poetic and perfect that they just bring tears to your eyes. It may be hard to believe, but Ratatouille is far better than any other animated films you will see this year, or perhaps that you will ever see. It manages to be better than Toy Story, better than Finding Nemo, even better than the fantastic Meet the Robinsons. I saw a pre-screening of the film on Saturday, June 16, but I cannot wait to see it again once it hits theaters everywhere on June 29. See Ratatouilleit is highly original, heartwarming, uplifting, and a very thrilling movie that has to be the best animated feature of the last few decades."
915,tt0382932,1,"I saw this movie in the sneak preview, and I just loved it! You will be amazed by its creativity and brilliance. I would easily vote it to be the best animation movie ever beating nemo, cars, monster inc, etc by a mile! This movie is for people of all age groups. Kids, adults and even those who do not like animations will love it.I do not want to say anything else here and spoil it for you. All I can say is if you do not watch it, you will be missing out on a very very very special movie.I have never written a review on here before, but this movie made me write one. Ratatouille is pure brilliance!"
916,tt0467110,3,"When I first became a father about 5.5 years ago, I was prepared for many of the sacrifices I'd have to make. I knew I'd have to change diapers and take them to swimming lessons and attend many a freezing Santa Claus parade, but I wasn't ready for the kind of sacrifice I made last night. This, in my humble opinion, is cruel and unusual punishment.Underdog is bad. It's not quite Karate Dog bad, but it makes The Shaggy Dog feel like Pulp Fiction. If Underdog were a television show, I'd recommend flipping on by. Not even the presence of Puddy and the voice of Banky Edwards can save it. Bow. Wow.It was also just about the best 80 minutes I've ever enjoyed. James was seated to the right of me and Michelle to the left, and I spent more time watching their reaction to this talking, flying mutt than watching the screen. At 5 and 3 years old, they were the target audience, and this movie nailed the target. There's a scene where Underdog belches loudly in another dogs face and Michelle thought it was the funniest scene ever captured on film. When Underdog was flying into outer space, James was literally at the edge of his seat, mesmerized. The kids absolutely loved Underdog, and that's why I was there. That's what last night was all about.Unless you're accompanying someone under the age of ten, you have no business wasting a second of your life watching this brutal film. But if you are looking to kill 80 minutes with your four year old, I won't judge. I had a blast."
917,tt0467110,1,"I gave this movie a 10 because as of today, this movie has an extremely low rating which I (and my 7 year old daughter) believe it does not deserve. In other words, I'm voting for all those kids 10 and under who are too busy doing something more important than reviewing movies online. This is, after all, a kids movie. You've got to see it for what it is. It's a cute movie with a cute dog and a half way decent plot (unless you're 7 then it's an awesome plot). If you're a parent you've probably have had to sit through some real painful movies, this is not one of them. My daughter (and many kids in the theater) were laughing out loud on many scenes. If you compare this movie to the original cartoons, well, people, let's be honest, the cartoons were pretty bad. Hey, it's a beagle with a funny voice that flies...and kids love it."
918,tt0467110,9,"You know, the old Underdog cartoons were a favorite of mine when I was little. I much preferred them to its counterparts in Rocky & Bulwinkle, Dudley Doright, and Fractured Fairy Tales. I really had forgotten what it was that I had loved so much about those old, cheaply animated cartoons.Then I saw this movie, and it actually reminded me about what I had liked so much -- the rhyming couplets of Underdog's speech, the inability for Polly Purebred to recognize that Shoeshine is Underdog, and one other thing which I will leave as a surprise (it's a bit of dialogue at the end of the film).Obviously, I disagree with many other reviewers here. Clearly, this has been marketed to kids, with the hope that nostalgic parents will be willing to cart the kids to the theater to see it. Four adults went with three children in my group, and all of us enjoyed the movie.First, let me say that it is rare to find a great movie for all ages. It's hard to find any sort of action/superhero genre movie that is not peppered with profanity, sexual innuendo, or potty humor. Underdog is almost nil on all those counts. What exists in this movie is far from the usual garbage that attempts to pass as humor. All of us felt comfortable with our children (age ranges 4 - 10) seeing this.I didn't mind the fact that the movie is not animated. The CGI stuff that animates the dogs' mouths does not trouble me. I mean, does anyone expect that this is going to be nominated for any Oscars? Sometimes movies exist just for escapist entertainment.For me, the movie hearkened back to the original cartoon as much as it could without looking stupid. Obviously, Underdog's alter-ego is not literally a clothed dog working as a shoeshine boy. But I think that what the writers and director did was fine. As a fan of the original series, I was not disappointed.I also liked Jason Lee's voice for Underdog. The script was humorous without being gross, and it clearly was geared for children. Simon Barsinister is an adequate villain, but rather upstaged by Patrick Warburton as the witless Cad.Like I said, others may disagree with me, but I think this is one that I'd buy on DVD to have in my child's library of movies. It's nice to know that there is something that kids can watch without having to be subjected to profanity or sexuality in everything that comes across the screen.It seems to me that most of the other reviewers have expected way too much or else have turned a too-critical eye on this pleasantly distracting bit of entertainment. As I said before, it evoked a lot of memories for me of the original, and I even liked the new spin on the theme song.Guys, every movie does not have to be Schindler's List, Lord of the Rings, Titantic, or some such other movie with critical acclaim."
919,tt0467110,8,"Occasionally, a film's trailer gives viewers a realistic preview. Such was the case with ""Underdog"". Here is a film with humor offered without the condescension and knowing winks delivered by Dreamworks Animation and its ilk. The story is a typical zap-the-hero setup and does not pretend to be otherwise.The actors (human and animal alike) deliver professional performances. Peter Dinklage is delicious as the requisite mad scientist. James Belushi is surprisingly effective and believable as the dad. Unfortunately, Patrick Warburton has descended from acceptably quirky into shtick. Newcomer Alex Neuberger (in his second feature) gives his part a nice emotional balance and doesn't overplay his sidekick work.The animal animation is nicely handled and devoid of gimmickry. This part of the movie industry deserves praise for continued development and polish.Summers have blockbusters created by and viewed by blocks; Underdog reminds audiences that a simple, fun flick can be far more entertaining."
920,tt0467110,4,"They did it again: ripped off an old show's title, then destroyed the nostalgia with boring ""re-imagined"" stuff. The '60's cartoon was one of the funniest of its time, a good-natured satire of super hero comic books. The character was drawn as 1/2 way between animal and human, the way Mickey Mouse is. Here they use a real beagle; that's about the same as making a Mickey Mouse watch with a real rat. Most of the clever schtick that made the original show funny is missing from this film. Instead, we get a clumsy ex-police dog who's even dumber than Cad. And some pet owners who add nothing to the story. Cheesy effects (the dog-talking animation is embarrassing). Poor scripting. A stereotyped dwarf playing Simon Bar Sinister. The gravelly noise box guy they hired to voice Underdog is painful. You'd think they'd at least gotten a voice impressionist to approximate Wally Cox's humorously distinctive voice for Underdog. But no. There are, at least, a few affectionate references to the source material (such as the rhyming lines), which lift it to a 4. Only small children that love dogs may enjoy this. Everybody else should get a DVD of the original cartoon series. Watch this only in desperation."
921,tt0467110,1,"I enjoyed this movie. Laughed, and yes, nearly cried. Wonderful to see the existential hero of a great film, ""The Station Agent"", playing Simon Bar Sinister to the hilt. Good acting. Human actors stood up well against the dog actors, who are known to upstage humans mercilessly. Also, one notable cat actor. Adequately plotted script, with hilarious dialogue. This movie is about a dog--a special dog. As if beagles weren't special enough without genetic enhancement, this beagle (voiced by Jason Lee with absolute sincerity, wit and insouciance) is burdened with super-hero gifts and responsibilities. Jim Belushi is the good dad, playing it straight and steady amidst general mayhem. Also nice examples of sensitive community police-work in this movie. Probably the most memorable thing for me this viewing (oh yeah, I'm going to see it again!!) is the special puff-of-smoke pattern, true to the original cartoon, that Underdog generates when he accelerates into full flight after hovering in the sky."
922,tt0467110,7,"This movie was good, with the only purpose of entertaining kids and grown up people too. The adaptation from the cartoon was really good and the plot was convincing and very well developed although the story has some flaws, for example, Sweet Polly was a poodle in the cartoon not a cocker spaniel. The cast was good very decent acting from everyone, Jason Lee as the voice of Underdog was very good as well as Amy Adams as Sweet Polly. James Belushi performance was good, very funny and the best one of all in my opinion was Patrick Warburton as Dr. Barsinister. In conclusion, a typical family movie, very enjoyable and entertaining."
923,tt0467110,3,"...........................................................from Pasto,Colombia...Via: L.A. CA., CALI, COLOMBIA.....and ORLANDO, FL(Just over 75 minutes till the credits) There aren't many Disney movies that I really dislike and even fewer dog movies, so despite a personal computer projection of 5.2 STARS, I decided to watch it. The story-line was hackneyed and inane. Despite a few well known cast members, the acting redefined ""Over-the-Top"".To be fair to the cast, perhaps this was director Frederick Du Chau's doing. Peter Dinklage (Station Agent) who I usually enjoy watching, was unwatchable. The supposedly ""comic"" dialog barely elicited a couple smiles, and sounded as if it had been ghost written by a computer.There was about a minute or two of eye candy in a few scenes with a CGI backdrop of the city. I suppose if you've got kids or grand kids 8 or under who love dogs, they'd get a kick out of itBut I don't see how any adult would! 3*STARS*...ENJOY/DISFRUTELA!...With KIDS! Any comments, questions or observations, in English or Español, are most welcome!"
924,tt0467110,7,"This movie was fun to watch, even for us adults. The humor was spot on, and the acting was what you'd expect. Jason Lee was great as Underdog's voice. Get this movie when it comes out on DVD. It's worth your while for a few chuckles with the kids. Even though it's aimed at kids, both my wife and I liked it, and honestly, I usually don't like kid's movies. I think they are usually way to low on the intelligence and believability scale. This one, actually had a decent story that didn't stray into stupidity and utter ridiculousness that most kid's movies do. Once again, go see this movie, or get the DVD when it comes out, you can see it again and again."
925,tt0467110,1,"When I heard Disney had the rights to ""Underdog"",I figured at the very least it would be a cool Pixar partnership affair,and we'd get a great Adults & Kids film like ""The Incredibles"". Alas...I forgot how Disney must dumb down classic material for today's dumbed down youth. What were they thinking? ""Underdog"" was a product of the 60's,your Prime Fanbase is in their 40's and 50's,why would you refocus it to 5 year olds? It should have been done ala ""Roger Rabbit"",half animated half real. Instead we get characters like Riff Raff ( a WOLF!! ) dumbed into another dog.""Underdog"" can't have an ""energy pill"",as we're now so ""enlightened"" it would obviously be a steroid or drugs reference.The only good casting was Patrick Warburton as ""Cad"" because he actually sorta resembles the cartoon version. Otherwise,old school ""Underdog"" fans should avoid this like the plague it is. What next? A live action version of ""The Go-Go Gophers"" disguised as a re-visionist history lesson? ( My advanced apologies if Disney jumps on this! )"
926,tt1059955,8,"Pixar has made so many blockbuster hits, each just about being almost better than the last in terms of anticipation translated to box office receipts, that it's tempting to speculate whether an upcoming movie will be the one infamously credited to bringing the juggernaut to a temporary halt. Going by what The Pixar Story presented, so long as the team stays hungry, focused and passionate with transforming their ideas into films stemming from the heart, then it's probably a formula that would be difficult to break, and computer animation fans will be in for a treat, for a long time to come.The Pixar Story is a documentary charting the meteoric rise of the company we all have probably in one way or another, come to love, with its groundbreaking effects and animation taking the world by storm with each new release. It's tough for any studio to build upon and better the success of its previous release with the new one, but somehow Pixar always managed to come through unscathed. But as the documentary reveals, it's never plain sailing, and thank goodness most of the cockups, especially weak stories, get junked and reworked, rather than the company crossing its fingers that a mediocre work could cut it. Technological advances also meant that animators get constantly challenged to break new ground, and the film systematically presents these challenges so that we the audience could take a step back, and appreciate the efforts.Most history buffs will already know that Pixar has its first origins from Lucasfilm (and you can sense George Lucas reeling from letting this opportunity run away), where a division with a mixed expertise of computer scientists and animators spun off to do what they love, and that's to explore the possibilities of combining their skills to make animation. And with angel investor Steve Jobs providing seed funding and despite the studio being in the red in the first few years, one short clip lead to a short film, and with Disney on board in an initial uneven partnership, Toy Story was born, and as they say, the rest is history.The first parts of the documentary devoted quite a lot of time to John Lasseter, who's credited with making things work with his direction of the first crop of movies coming out of Pixar. It traces his professional start as an animator with Walt Disney, the run ins and the unfortunate firing, which turned out to be a blessing in disguise on hindsight. We see how he, and the rest of his co-workers, had to undertake pressure to perform, each pouring in copious amounts of personal sacrifice to turn their dream into reality. And with each success, the director taking over the reins for the next movie, will no doubt feel the pressure of its predecessor's success, especially Pete Doctor coming off Lesseter's impressive track record, and others like Brad Bird coming from outside the company culture.We take a sneak peek into the facilities at their swanky company grounds, admiring the grounds in which Pixar creations are conceived, but what is of extreme value here is the tons of archived footage, most of which are unseen because they never see the light of day, be it rough storyboard sketches or skeletal computer animation, most of which contain early stages of the characters with whom we've been acquainted with. The Pixar Story spent significant amount of time on Toy Story (since it's the first movie), and you can witness how the early Woody character and storyline was rejected because they didn't seem right. And it seems that Pixar doesn't compromise on quality - that plans do get trashed if they don't measure up, even with a fixed deadline looming. Talk about grit, determination and perfectionism all rolled into one.With plenty of interviews with the creators, big name CEOs past and present, and the stars sharing their experience with providing the voices for their digital counterparts, director Leslie Iwersk also provided a brief look into the political wrangling behind the scenes, just for completeness sake, making The Pixar Story well suited for anyone curious to know how it call started, and how the energy is sustained until this very day."
935,tt0492956,8,"This film was very good. A great family movie with the only purpose of entertaining people with that unique touch that only Disney can give. It has a very simple yet enjoyable story about a famous football player who's life is all about football, parties, women and his dog apparently a very good life but also a very lonely one when someday a girl appears at his door telling that he is her dad and there's where he must learn how to be a parent and at the same time to live. The cast is good. The Rock proves that he is more than an action hero, he also can do comedy in a very good way, the little girl Madison Pettis is so cute and his acting is great, she looks very natural. Roselyn Sanchez delivers a good supporting role as the girl's ballet teacher and Kyra Sedgwick although it was a short performance it was also very convincing. In conclusion, a very good family that you will enjoy"
927,tt1059955,8,"Like almost every child of my generation, I grew up on Pixar and in particular Toy Story. Some of my fondest and most memorable cinematic memories were going to see Monsters Inc, Finding Nemo and The Incredibles (where afterwards I thought ""I can't wait for the sequel""). I remember that one of my first dream jobs in film was to write stories for Pixar and explore all the imaginative possibilities. Now that I've gotten more into film, I've gained a deeper respect for their storytelling and their technology and how hard it is. The Pixar Story tracks the origin of Pixar from when John Lasseter was first inspired to pursue animation to around 2007, before Ratatouille hit the screens. It's an informative look into how the company came to be and of all the struggles. It's very interesting as I would like to get into the industry as well. The biggest chunk is the struggle to create Toy Story - not just to get it commissioned but also to find the story. This is also a trouble with Monsters Inc. where they had the concept but almost too many possibilities to explore. Narrowing down those possibilities is a incredibly difficult job and is something I'm aspiring to achieve at this very moment so it was especially fascinating to watch.It's always great fun to have a look into their offices with their scooters and arcades. However, perhaps this documentary has come too soon, they talk about fears of being too factory-line, setting a standard they can no longer top and as this comes before one of their most successful strands of films with Wall-E, Up (a film that I didn't like at first but it's grown on me) and Toy Story 3 and then perhaps the beginning of a very boring strand with Cars 2, Brave and Monsters University, I want to know whether they think they're topping themselves or have sunken into a comfort zone. A short reflection on their fears would be very interesting. The doc focuses on the followup chaos after the Toy Story section, with second project syndrome lingering over the Pixar team. A Bug's Life was considered a success at the time and although in hindsight, many disagree, the documentary put me in the mood to rewatch and while the first act is perhaps a bit too childish, it grows and grows and is exceptional storytelling in the end. I hope Pixar haven't peaked with the closure of Toy Story 3 and they can continue making films that get to me. The documentary also makes great use of graphics and animation which is pretty appropriate for this topic. Very entertaining and informative.8/10"
928,tt1059955,1,"Wow...what a great and thorough film. This is the story of Pixar Studio--from its earliest days to the present (which was 2007 at the time). It offers so much more than you might expect from such a film--wonderful access to the folks who built the studio who you might think were too busy or too important to participate--but they did. So, in addition to seeing lots of great films being made, you get to meet folks like John Lasseter and Steve Jobs and see them as people--very excited and creative people, but still people. Amazing access, however, isn't all. You also get a great sense of excitement and fun--and it's practically impossible to watch this film without feeling this and feeling inspired--and the music sure helps with this as well. For fans of CGI...heck, for ANYONE, this is a must-see film and you learn a lot and have a great time learning. See this film."
929,tt1059955,9,"As a huge animation fan, I like the Pixar films very much. They are funny, poignant and are beautifully animated with lovable characters. In fact, while I prefer some of their films over others there is no Pixar film I hate. I saw this documentary by chance knowing little about it, and I loved it. The Pixar Story was so interesting and even moving. The interviews are well delivered and written, and I found them and how certain scenes were animated and done really intriguing. I also loved the music and the animated sequences featured especially for the door climax from Monsters Inc and the incredibly moving When Somebody Loved Me from Toy Story 2(Tom Hanks summed it up brilliantly). The Pixar Story goes along at a good pace and is a perfect length too. If anything though, I would have liked to have seen more of the Pixar shorts, as some of those are gems. But this is just nitpicking and doesn't take away from the fact that this documentary is wonderful. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
930,tt1059955,1,"An informative, inspiring, and important film, spanning Pixar's story, and the story of technological advancement through 3-D animation. The documentary walks us through the pre-Pixar era, covering the rudimentary computer graphics in development through the 1970s and 1980s, when Star Wars and Star Trek's special effects ignited a new era in filmmaking . Then, the film describes the early day of Pixar's early founders (e.g., John Lasseter) in venturing through Disney's territory of 2-D animations in general, and his happenstance with Steve Jobs. Some immersive footage and reports are featured in the film all along, transporting the viewer back to the days covered. Further, the viewer will also become familiar with both the early technological challenges and later psychological roadblocks that appeared from a small company that became, in essence, an overnight success (thanks to films like Toy Story). The company's challenges with Disney were also described, and the recreation of the Pixar's leadership and offerings, featuring films from a number of talented and creative director, are also covered. The Pixar Story, therefore, brings inthe contextual and personal factors that have made Pixar the company it then was in 2007, and the company it has now become. This is a must-see for the curious mind on Pixar and for those interested in the computer graphics and animation revolution that Pixar helped launch."
931,tt1059955,8,"My review of The Pixar Story allows me to release a theory on the studio's film Toy Story I vaguely established several months back and only came to fully formulate upon watching the documentary. The film details how Pixar was so advanced, innovative, and intimidating to several graphic designers and the animation industry in general, it was somewhat ostracized and manipulated by Disney because they had no idea just what to do with them. Sort of like how in Toy Story, Buzz Lightyear is sort of brushed off and mocked by Woody and several other toys upon his arrival. However, by the end, the toys all learn to work together in unison for the greater good of...the toybox, perhaps? If you allow Buzz Lightyear to represent Pixar, Woody as Disney, and the additional toys as other animated studios and computer designers, the film is sort of allegorical in the regard to the rise of Pixar. Whether this is intentional or not is up for serious debate. I think it was just my brain overworking itself after a long line of average movies.On the other hand, the documentary The Pixar Story is, like the studio, something to behold. It's a necessary and efficient profile of one of the best and most powerful studios today, and sheds light on the innovators creating the films loved by kids and adults alike. It begins by showing us three men that drove the forces of Pixar as we know it. They are Ed Catmull, a technical officer, Steve Jobs, the late entrepreneur and CEO of Apple, and John Lasseter, Pixar's founding father. We learn that Lasseter was into animation from just a little kid, and relished the thought that he could grow up to make cartoons for a living.He attended California Institute of the Arts, where he won back-to-back Student Academy Awards for two short films he made while in school. When he finally got a job at Disney, he spent a lengthy time developing ideas for intriguing and innovative cartoons before he was fired because Disney, ultimately, didn't know what to do with such an ambitious soul. He was trying to introduce the wonders of computer animation to the company in the mid 1980's, when the machine was already being feared as a substitute for man. Lasseter tried to implore, however, that the computer is a tool for the artist and that it's inherently incapable of creative thinking. That's where an artist comes in.Catmull who assisted a lot with the technical side of Lasster's animation and even is credited with creating the first computer animated scene in film history in the 1976 film FutureWorld, while Jobs invested and believed so much in Lasseter's vision he was able to take several financial beatings before even returning any money, leading him to be called the world's most forgiving venture capitalist. In a sense, these men were rebels without a utensil. They believed in a new way to create art enough to further it and churn out film after film, each one a financial and critical success.After establishing the three men, the film looks extensively at the production of Toy Story. Lasseter claims that making this the studio's first feature was an intelligent decision because he stated early on he did not want to follow in the footsteps of Disney by creating frothy musicals and mythical fairy-tales. Through numerous uphill battles, the film was made and received universal rave reviews. The animation was dazzling, the storyline clicked with young kids and the adults, who didn't see the film as one to endure but one to enjoy, and the immensity of the animated setting and the gravity-defying ways the characters were moving was simply remarkable and never-before-seen. The film also details how the film's release sparked questions about the future of computer animated features and whether or not they would be the future and hand-drawn/traditional animation would later be phased out with the times. The Pixar staff in the film make perfectly clear that time between Toy Story and A Bug's Life, their followup film, was nervewracking because they had to prove that they were the real deal and people weren't just overhyping their work.On a final note, the latter act of the film concerns the traditional vs. computer animation debate and how after Disney films began to take a loss in revenue, the medium of traditional animation was rejected in favor of its sleeker, more visually dazzling cousin. In my opinion, the two could've coexisted and the demise was the fault of studios like Disney and DreamWorks not updating their stories and not their technology. Pixar raised the bar in animation, but it did the same in storytelling too, and American audiences didn't care to see a film like Disney's Home on the Range, Jungle Book 2, or Teacher's Pet when their sister-studio Pixar was churning out films like Finding Nemo, Monsters, Inc., and Toy Story 2 during the exact same time. Pixar's magical quality stemmed from them allowing the stereotype of animated films being for kids to gradually disappear and get adults, teenagers, and the elderly excited for their latest endeavor. The bar was raised in both departments, and Disney should've realized that films about singing cows and singing jungle animals weren't going to cut it any longer. The demise of the animation the studio pioneered was its own fault - not Pixar, who unfortunately was handed much of the blame.The Pixar Story is a solid documentary exploring a profound, revolutionary studio, and, in addition to it taking a look at each individual Pixar film (we can try and forgive the huge amount of time the film spends developing Toy Story and how the remaining six features get the cold shoulder in terms of how much time they're allotted on screen) explores a medium that definitely deserves a documentary in its honor."
932,tt1059955,7,"I'd heard this was remarkable, but it seems like a lot of that was hype. Pixar seems like an unbelievably cool place to work, and I loved the message of ""quirky small company refuses to give up their personality for financial stability"" but there were only a small handful of moments that really felt like big deals. It's amazing how many huge names they wrangled up for the interviews, though, (seriously, you got Steve Jobs and Bob Iger to sit down for a good length of time? That's pretty impressive) and those little chats are the most revealing, interesting moments of the entire documentary. Once the subject of Toy Story comes up, it becomes a tale of ""and here's how we made our next big, huge, runaway success."" It's also overproduced to the point of distraction. Good but not great."
933,tt1059955,1,"This is an amazing story of artists, engineers and computer geeks who share a fascination with computer animation and movie making. This eclectic collaboration of hard work and family friendly movie making was rivaled only by Walt Disney himself and resulted in a string of amazing cinematic successes rare in the movie industry - a must see!"
934,tt1059955,7,"The documentary of the history of Pixar Animation Studios. Pixar is absolutely a fabulous success story. It has been often spoken of as an overnight success, but as Steve Jobs says in the film, most overnight successes takes years of hard work.It was interesting to see the evolution of animation and the kind of dedication and vision that goes behind something that is - in hindsight - a no-brainer decision. For me, I was surprised to see the fat Steve Jobs in here. The images of slim Steve Jobs with his penetrating eyes was so strongly embedded in my mind that every time Steve spoke, I hardly heard what he was saying over the sound of how chubby he looked. :DAlso, I found out Pixar's original foundation, Lucasfilm, had to regretfully let go due to lack of funds. It was once again a surprise for me that George Lucas, the creator of the 'Holy Trilogy', had a cash problem.It was also surprising that even after an unsurpassed, unimaginable success with it's first feature release, creating a whole new genre, raking in cash, accolades and awards, Pixar still had bureaucratic challenges for almost all of its releases. I guess I don't understand Hollywood executives or production houses. But that's OK - I understand the movies, and Pixar is pure magic."
936,tt0492956,7,"OK, I know that The Game Plan was very cheesy and extremely predictable, but who cares? What were people expecting? It's Disney, it's supposed to be this kind of a film. I saw The Game Plan with my friend yesterday and we both liked it, we got a few laughs from it and it was over all a well made movie. We were both very impressed with the little actress, Madison Pettis, who played The Rock's daughter, she was incredibly believable and didn't over do her role or was too cute that it made you sick. The script may not be Oscar material, but it was perfect for a family film and the story while it may not be the most original, still had it's funny and touching moments.Joe is a quarterback on Boston's football team and they are about to go to the championships. His personal life is usual the same each night, party all night with his buds and party all night with the good looking women. But all that changes when there's a stranger at the door, a little girl who claims to be his daughter, her name is Peyton and that she's his daughter from a short marriage he had. With his expensive home and party life style, Joe may need to make some changes to his life, as hard as that may be. But he ends up gaining something more in the end, a loving daughter to call him ""daddy"".Like I said, this is a Disney film, don't expect Oscar worthy material, it's just a fun little family flick. No one will ever get sick of the ""big guy with muscles"" trying to relate to the little one's, just look at Kindergarten Cop or The Pacifier, both films were good and have a lot of fans. Besides if someone can tell me the honest truth that they were not laughing at The Rock's allergic reaction to cinnamon and started speaking like Daffy Duck, they really must not have a funny bone in their body. The Game Plan is the perfect family film for the season, it's a cute film.7/10"
937,tt0492956,9,"This was a thoroughly enjoyable family movie. Saw it with my wife and 10 year old son and we all had a great time. The Rock is improving as an actor and was quite funny, especially in the Ballet... The little girl was very cute. The humor was squeaky clean and the message was clear and sweet. Loved it. Kyra Sedwick was funny in places which I'm not used to seeing. The supporting cast of football players was well done. There isn't much football in the movie so it won't turn off non-athletes. I think the Rock's charm will continue to drive his career as he is able to always bring the charm while pulling off the tough male ego."
938,tt0492956,1,"We saw this tonight. It was wonderful. My husband took one look at all the little girls seated in the theater and said, ""Did you choose the right movie?"" But he laughed from start to finish, as did all the other men in the theater.The story is about a selfish star quarterback who plays for the Boston Rebels NFL team. (Ah, if only it were so). He has a fabulous bachelor pad and a bulldog. He adores Elvis and has adopted his nickname, calling himself Joe ""The King"" Kingman. A wee eight year-old girl shows up on his doorstep and says she is his daughter. This throws him off balance to say the least.The Rock plays the part very well. I heard a LOT of sniffles during emotional parts. The little girl who plays his daughter is adorable.I highly recommend."
939,tt0492956,8,"In ""The Game Plan"" after being high-jacked to the mall by his 8 year-old daughter Peyton (adorable Madison Pettis) and her ballerina crew, Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson as Superstar Quarterback Joe Kingman is held captive at a ""Make Your Own Doll"" shop. Roselyn Sanchez as Peyton's ballet instructor Monique arrives to the rescue. ""The Rock"", crammed in children's chair, is combing out the hair of the doll he made. ""The Rock"" humbly tells Monique, ""Thanks for saving me"" Joe wistfully concedes that he is not at all good at thisbeing a Dad. Monique reminds him that women being better anyway, are better at this sort of thing. Then in a touching admission, she tells Joe that fathers are important in that they teach daughters courage, and ""They make us brave."" Director Andy Fickman's ""The Game Plan"" is surprisingly both touching and sweet. Sentimental is a givenif you have a problem with that, you need to crawl back under a rock, because the sunshine emerges shamelessly in ""The Game Plan"". ""The Game Plan"" works, because of The Rock's undeniable charm, and his natural chemistry with Madison Pettis.Film critic Richard Roeper commented that The Rock has squandered the opportunity of being the next huge action star, with his recent roles. I don't think so. For one thing: Action star roles are not very interesting. The Rock is a smart guy, and he is choosing roles with career longevity in mind. The Rock's gift is light comedy. He is incredibly charming and has amazing comedic timing. Granted this comedy leverages the incongruity of his physicality and athleticism offset against cute little Peyton ""P"" and gorgeous Monique. The Rock is a strikingly handsome man, and standing 6'4"" with the ripped body he is imposing. Note the great CGI work seamlessly covers his tribal tattoos. I am a huge fan of The Rock. Here in ""The Game Plan"" he is funny, charming, and charismatic. As cute and adorable as Madison Pettis is as P, The Rock is never over shadowed. His evolving relationship with Peyton is poignant and endearing. Pettis is stellar, not overplaying cute-- she just is. She also displays amazing restraint on the whole precociousness little girl deal. Although the audience is a little shaky on Peyton's real story, her mission to know her father (Joe) lands as genuine. Among the interview questions she asks trolling for the desired answer, ""What is best thing that ever happened to you?"" The initially selfish Joe says that it his limited collectors release of his athletic shoe. Wrong answer.The Rock plays Joe Kingman, All-Pro Quarterback for the playoff bound Boston Rebels. He revels in his celebrity lifestyle. Joe is rich, good-looking, single, and lives with his bulldog Spike in his mega bachelor pad. His agent Stella (taut and hilarious Kyra Sedgwick) tells Joe, he is about to make ""Tiger Woods money"". He parties with supermodel Tatiana (good vapid Kate Nauta). He hangs with his player crew (hilarious Hayes MacArthur, Brian White, and Jamal Duff). Arrogant Joe mercilessly tells his wide receiver Sanders (solid and charming Morris Chestnut) that he needs to retrieve his ""Man Card"". That is the way Joe rolls. Joe is also a greatness poser. Joe is all ""I am great. You're not."" Joe's world immediately alters when little Peyton (Pettis) arrives at Joe's door, announcing that she is in fact his daughter. Peyton tells Joe that she is staying with him for 4 weeks while her mom is doing humanitarian work in Africa, and can not be reached by cell phone.In recap, Joe is now a Dad, and leading his Rebels to the Super Bowl. Clearly he has a clue for only one of these responsibilities. Fortunately, Joe finds a dance school for little ballerina Peyton. To his utter disbelief the instructor Monique (beautiful and feisty Roselyn Sanchez) has no idea regarding Joe's celebrity. Monique soon enrolls Joe into his responsibility as a parent. The resulting aftermath is Joe's participation in a ballet production. There is a hysterical scene as Monique hands Joe his ballet tights. Joe dismisses, ""Oh, no! I am a freakishly large man!"" Will Joe knock it off, and surrender to his innate greatness becoming a leader for his team and a loving father for Peyton? No worries. Thankfully ""The Game Plan"" is a Disney Pictures movie. ""The Game Plan"" is also the rarity in contemporary timesa family movie that is smart, sentimental, sweet, and all heart. The Rock is awesome. In my older age I'll embrace cheesy and sentimental, when stories celebrate the very best in people. Take a chance on ""The Game Plan""."
940,tt0492956,8,"Well, I got to see this tonight as a sneak preview. I went in excited because the trailer cracked me up and wasn't disappointed. It was cute. Some of the lines are corny but some of it was serious stuff. You get to see some emotion from Johnson. The beginning cracks you up, you see this guy basically in love with himself trying to make it to the big one of his football career when he has a little girl thrust upon him. He doesn't know what to do, how to handle her. I think that the background relationship with his father could have been fleshed out a little better,you only get a hint of it, but otherwise it was a good movie. Some of the parts are HILARIOUS!! The little girl in the movie has got definite attitude and it cracked me up. Overall it was a decent movie, a good one to see."

942,tt0492956,1,"I was a child of the 1960s, and grew up seeing many of those classic Walt Disney films when originally released. After Walt Disney passed away, the Disney films decades later didn't seem to have that same feel to them. ""The Game Plan"" seems like one of those classic Disney films from the 60s, but up to date rather than in days gone by. I saw a Sneak Preview on Saturday. In ""The Game Plan,"" Boston Quarterback Joe Kingman is quite surprised when he suddenly learns that he has a 6 year old daughter from a previous marriage. It is a story on how his life changes from the playboy lifestyle of perhaps the most eligible bachelor in the NFL to that of a high profile dad. It's a light hearted comedy. My call on ""The Game Plan"" is that it will be #1 at the Box Office this weekend. It's a good movie. Go see it."
943,tt0492956,9,"I went to see this as a chaperone for kids on a camp day field trip. I must say it is one of Disney's best recent films. a lot of Disney's movies today are corny and boring, and not funny at all. This is a major exception. This a great family film the whole family will enjoy. The idea of a young girl being thrust upon a parent who doesn't even know about her is not original, but the setting is pretty cool in this film.The acting is terrific. Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson is stepping out of his regular role for this movie. He plays a self-centered NFL quarterback who's dreams of being a champion are suddenly hampered by discovering he had a long lost daughter. Now he has to learn not to be so arrogant, and learn how to be a compassionate father. I think he did a wonderful job acting, and he was very funny. It proves that The Rock doesn't need fights, guns, and explosions for him to make an impact on the screen. Madison Pettis was simply cute and adorable as The Rock's daughter. She did an excellent job. She showed great emotion and timing for such a young actress. There were a few parts of the movie that were slightly dull, and few of the jokes weren't delivered very well, but those are a small part of this movie. A little cheesy? perhaps. A little corny at times? Probably. But that's actually a reason to like this humorous film. The whole theater was laughing many times, and the emotional scenes were indeed emotional. The Rock even did well in those scenes. With good acting, a good family plot, and good family fun humor, this makes a very good family film. I won't say it's a classic, but it's close. I give it a 9/10."
944,tt0492956,8,"Personally, it was the trailers that made me want to see this movie from the start. Let's get serious, this was not supposed to be 'Shindler's List' or something. It's a comedy about a football player! If anyone expected anything more they were deluded from the start. ""The Rock"" was very decent in this role, but he wasn't supposed to be the superstar of the film, just the superstar of the team -- that a big difference. Pettis was amazing, as was Kyra Sedgwick. And the team...the team of knucklehead football players stole the show in every scene they were in. The comedy had its slapstick moments but for the most part it was heartfelt and warm. I took my 7 and 6 year old daughters to see and they loved it. Definitely a must-see family film and certainly a DVD buy!"
945,tt0461770,9,"I'm a teenage boy, and the reviews for ""Enchanted,"" along with some friendly persuasion from my sisters, moved me to give this live action/animated combo. a chance. In the first fourteen minutes of Enchanted, there were two things that caught my attention: 1)The never-ending, sugar-coated, sing-along tune and 2) The grainy style of animation that Disney lavished upon the screen(a tribute to the Disney classics, such as Beauty and the Beast and Sleeping Beauty); in this time span, I felt truly embarrassed to be sitting in the theater with the older couples clustered around me. I mean, what kind of boy in his right mind would want to watch a movie with musical numbers and pretty princesses? And yet, there was something about it...the aire of it almost took me back to the days of my childhood when I would smash my face up to the T.V. screen, when Belle and the Beast were having their unforgettable ball dance or when Ariel was brushing her hair with a fork. It was these sorts of memories that surfaced to my mind as I kept watching Enchanted. And it kept getting better and better. When there was a sudden switch to live-action, my heart was captured by Amy Adams, who seems to be, in my opinion, the finest choice for Giselle. Prince Edward and Robert also had their perfect fits (James Marsden and Patrick Dempsey). Even though this movie is close to perfect, it still has its problems. There is an aire of predictability in the storyline, as well as the fact that it's swamped with clichés (some of which are fresh, and some of which are flat). Yet it flows on, innocently, with its strong actors/actresses, decent-enough screenplay that gives you a warm feeling in your heart (which is what Disney is supposed to do, right?), spectacular music numbers that have charm, and the fact that it is suitable for all ages. There is a little something for everyone in this film--and it's not just a film either--it is a time-machine back to the golden era of Disney's animated films, and its live-action ones as well. And it helps me look forward to the new Disney: one that keeps surprising me more and more every single day."
946,tt0461770,8,"Combining elements of modern day Manhattan with romanticized fairy tale settings, ""Enchanted"" tells the story of Giselle (Adams), your typical Disney leading lady living in a cottage, singing with innocent creatures, awaiting the day she would meet her prince charming. He turns out to be Prince Edward (James Marsden), a dashing debonair who happens to be the stepson of the wicked witch Queen Narissa (Susan Sarandon). They meet, fall in love in a whim, and decide to marry the next day.Problem is, step-mom wouldn't allow anyone to take over her throne so she poses as an old woman and pushes a clueless Giselle into a well that transports to - ahem - our world, where her quixotic perspective sets her apart from everyone else. Her city misadventures eventually lead her to Robert (Patrick Dempsey), a divorce lawyer separated from his wife and trying to raise his daughter Morgan (Rachel Covey) by himself.While awaiting to be rescued by her Prince Edward, Giselle bonds with father and daughter, with him teaching her a thing or two about dating, and her teaching him on the positive aspects of love.While obviously an attempt to satirize the genre it carved its name on, this Disney flick helmed by Kevin Lima does it in a way that's not in a mocking manner as Dreamworks animated films usually are. Rather, they are handled with affection that makes the fairy tale angle a rather sweet and funny affair. The interweaving elements of live-action and animation blend alright and don't feel unbalanced.Of course, you can say that this movie really belongs to Adams, who with her cheerful nature, makes it easy for one to feel for her character by providing depth and giving an additional dimension to Giselle. The supporting cast pale in comparison although they do have their moments, especially Sarandon who easily hams it up during a climactic event.""Enchanted"" doesn't necessarily mark a return of the old fairy tale magic conspicuously absent in recent Disney films; but it has the charms and clever wit - not to mention star Amy Adams bubbly charisma - to win over audiences outside the target demographic."
947,tt0461770,1,"I first saw the trailer for Enchanted in the spring, from the moment it ended, I knew this was a movie that I wanted to see. I finally saw it today and it's everything that I hoped for and more. It was nice to finally see a Disney movie that wasn't computer animated, the beginning was almost a forgotten memory of the old fashion animation that I miss so much. But Enchanted is without a doubt one of the most fun films of the year and so perfect for the whole family. I though the plot was so extremely clever, what if the cartoons with the fairytale stories met into today's world? Especially in New York City? The cast just looked like they had the ultimate blast making this movie and really brought it to life. They each held their own and were a perfect choice for the comedic role they had to play. Enchanted is a clever twist on the classic fairy tale.Giselle has just met the prince of her dreams, he's saved her from a troll and asked for her hand in marriage, everything seems to be going good for them. But Prince Edward's step mother has other plans in mind when she doesn't want to give up her crown and let Giselle take it. So she sends Giselle to another world, one where there is no ""happily ever after"", cut to New York City 2007. She's in human form and needs to get back to her land, she meets a man Robert and his daughter, Morgan, she stays with them and ends up falling for Robert. Just in time since Prince Edward throws himself to the other dimension to save her, but it's definitely a life changing experience for both of them, especially when the queen arrives to take care of Giselle herself.Enchanted is one of the year's best movies and one of Disney's best, I guarantee it'll be a true classic down the line. The whole story was charming as well as funny and just a great time to watch, I don't know if I could pick a favorite part, there were so many to choose from, but I think the part where the prince first arrives to New York, how determined he is, he even takes on the city bus because he thinks it's a beast. For me, I think James Mardson stole the film as Prince Edward, he just played it off so perfectly and was such a pleasure to watch on the screen. Enchanted is one of the year's best films, I would highly recommend it for you or the family, it's a definite treasure of 2007.10/10"
948,tt0461770,1,"I had recently seen a screening of this movie and was pleasantly surprised that it had completely exceeded my expectations. The theater was full of laughs from the beginning throughout all ages. In the beginning I was worried that Amy Adams would make Giselle seem like some obnoxious daytime children's television character, but instead she managed to please the audience during the entire movie. There was also enough humor to keep the older viewers entertained from hilarious allusions to popular fairy tales and even some ""adult"" themes insinuated, while still keeping the film Disney clean. Overall I completely enjoyed this movie and recommend it to all families."
949,tt0461770,8,"In honor of the Thanksgiving holiday, I will post a family film review. Who better to deliver in that genre than Disney with their new animated/live action hybrid Enchanted. This movie is very cute and quite good at being both wholesome for the kiddies and tongue-in-cheek for the adults. You need to appreciate a studio being able to poke fun at itself. By using the classic stories of Cinderella, Snow White, and Sleeping Beauty, all made famous in their own right by the Mouse House, we are given some big laughs. The acting is very self-referential and broad as far as the fairy tale roles that make the journey into our world's New York City go. Screenwriter Bill Kelly gives the cast some great lines and set pieces to play in, ultimately showing us that the storybooks aren't always right. True love does exist, but not necessarily with the one you first think. The message is good, the songs are good, the animation and acting are goodDisney came through with this one. Along with Meet the Robinsons, Mickey and friends may be turning the ship around into a new renaissance.We are ushered into the story with some 2D animation of Giselle, a pretty girl looking for her Prince Charming. That man is in fact Prince Edward, recently being led by his stepmother's henchman to battle ogres and partake in adventure to keep his mind off a wife. You see if he marries, Queen Narissa loses her crown and he becomes King. She is having none of that and will cross into evil stepmother/queen/hag territory to trick Giselle into falling through a portal to our world. Now a fish-out-of-water, she must find her way back to her love, that eventually comes looking for her along with her best friend Pip the squirrel and the evil witch's lackey Nathaniel. It is on this path that she runs into divorce lawyer Robert Philip and turns both his and her life upside down.I love how the fantasy world comes into ours so awkwardly. Giselle's ability to call on all the animals of her meadows allows her to do the same in NY, only the creatures she gets are rats, pigeons, cockroaches, and fliesyet they all do the work anywayit's priceless. Also, when she breaks into song, all the people on the streets join along and have a blast being part of the huge choreographed numbers. Her innocence is very precious and trying new things always gets her new lawyer friend in trouble, yet helps those in her wake. Patrick Dempsey plays that friend to great effect. He sees what she is doing and can't help but fall for her joyful, inability to see cruelty in the world. Playing the straight man to her craziness leads to wonderful moments of laughter as well as those full of poignancy and compassion, giving the kids in the audience something to think about and lessons to learn.While Dempsey's evolution as a man is something to appreciate, it is the transplants that shine. Amy Adams and James Marsden play Giselle and Prince Edward respectively. They bring the happy-go-lucky mentality of Andalasia to our disenchanted realm. The over-acting is great and the culture shock fantastic. Adams is gorgeous and has the chops to make the aloofness work, but also change later on into a human being that sees what reality brings. When she tells Edward that she was thinking instead of singing, his reaction really hits home on the vast void between storybook fantasy and the real world. As for Marsden, his childish actions are truly funny; a borderline simpleton, he believes in chivalry and when he is told a suspected villain is really a friend, he just flips a switch and is OK with it. His smile is infectious and his vacant expressions indispensable to the film working on the dual levels it does.Everything works here to bring a wonderful family-friendly story to life. Complete with its pop-up book bookends, Enchanted is truly magical. I don't know how it could ever have worked as a complete animated work, as I have read it originated as, so thankfully they took the plunge to expand it with live action. Crossing between the two worlds is seamless2D characters turned into humans or 3D computer generated animals. With many instances ripe for a wrong turn, the filmmakers seem to come to all the right decisions. Working in older Disney yarns and playing each story thread to its effective conclusion leaves us with a tale that could become a classic amongst the ones it appropriates. So, if you are looking for a way to spend a couple hours with the whole family, Enchanted is definitely a great way to go."
950,tt0461770,9,"I went to see Enchanted at the premiere on 20/10/2007 and I was really pleasantly surprised. I had expected all the usual Disney trademarks to be included; singing, animation, animals that talk, a prince and an evil stepmother, all these was there but also so much more! I was not expecting the film to be as funny as it was; it's packed with jokes; quite a few were aimed at adults, so went over the children's heads, but the weren't rude or distasteful enough to offend the children. This film is an 'all rounder'; it contains all the Disney elements that children and adults love, but also enough to humour to make it an enjoyable comedy for the adults.Amy Adams is brilliant as the innocent Giselle, she embodies everything that a Disney character should; from her musical ensembles to her sunny view of the world. Patrick Dempsey plays the cynical lawyer, who isn't sure if Giselle has banged her head or is just crazy! James Marsden is perfect as the classic Disney prince; suave and arrogant, while Susan Sarandon obviously relishes being the evil witch. Timothy Spall plays the bumbling, and occasionally annoying, side-kick, but he also provides the basis for many of the jokes.Disney knows what works, and have included many of their much-loved formulas, but they haven't been afraid to venture away from their traditional 'girl meets boy, they get married and live happily ever after' narrative. And that's what really makes this film stand out. If I were to sum up this film, I'd say 'a brilliant fusion'. It fuses animation with actors, Andalasia with New York, pigeons with chipmunks, Prince Charming with a Divorce Lawyer, humour with love, modern dilemmas with traditional values and Disney past, with what I hope is Disney future.Definitely worth a watch, and the best part is, you won't even need to use your children as an excuse to go!"
951,tt0461770,1,"The movie is quite simply, the best Family movie in the past few years. From the beginning, the movie sucks you in with narration from a Disney Legend. You fall in love with the characters right away and it's quite simply a return to the greatness that Disney can deliver. The cast led by Amy Adams, Patrick Dempsey, James Marsden and Timothy Spall (Wormtail from the Harry Potter movies who gives an inspired Oscar-worthy performance) is impeccable. Rounding out the cast is Susan Sarandon who is part Evil Queen, part Maleficent and pure EVIL and the adorable Rachel Covey who is the perfect ""mini-princess"" for Giselle to play off of. The music by Stephen Schwartz and Alan Menken (in a return to brilliance) is terrific. The original songs are the best to come out of Disney since The Hunchback of Notre Dame. The story, quite simply is part fish-out-of-water, part romantic comedy, part animated and all fun. The live-action portion of the movie feels like your watching animation. The way that Giselle infects those around her with her innocent ""Princess-esque"" demeanor is really at the heart of what makes the movie so great. Of course, it wouldn't be Disney without a few scene-stealing animals who don't take over the movie and really are what they are meant to be, supporting characters. There are a few nods to the past as well. I won't share them here, but let's just say they are subtle enough not to be distracting, but still there enough to bring a smile to your face. The violence in the movie is nothing more than what you would see in any other PG family movie, and really aside from being live-action, isn't anything you wouldn't see in movies such as Sleeping Beauty or Snow White."
960,tt1127884,7,"First, I did not see this movie. My wife took our eight-year-old daughter for a girls' night out and they enjoyed it immensely. And that's the reason to see this movie.I tried like crazy to get tickets to the concerts, but missed out. While it is clear that this is a ""money grab"", it's also ""sort of"" an apology from Disney for messing up the ticketing for the concert. Although $15 is extreme for a 74 minute show, it suited my daughter just fine. She got real-cool 3-D glasses (not the cheap cardboard kind), ate popcorn, spent time with her mom, and got to see Hannah Montana and the Jonas Brothers perform on stage outside the rather limited format of the Disney show. She couldn't be happier.So, the way I see it, I saved about $150 plus parking and souvenirs, and about six hours of my life, for the bargain price of $15. If only everything was this easy."
952,tt0461770,9,"First off, I want to say that, there is a comment on this thread where someone calls Enchanted disturbing, should be rated R, etc. It is obvious she did not see the film. This reviewer is high, and, this review should be removed.Enchanted was a surprisingly great, fun modernized Cinderella tale, including 3 show- stopping musical numbers where the test audience applauded after each song.Amy Adams is perfect, James Marsden, once again, as he was in Hairspray, was very appealing. I felt Patrick Dempsey was good, if not a tad old for the part, and, his fiancé was OK, nothing spectacular. (in fact, I feel this movie would have worked a bit better if Dempsey had a good girl ""friend"" vs a fiancé).That being said, I loved the message this movie teaches to children, that is, get to know someone before saying ""i do"" (as is the message with way too many princess movies, and is the reason why too many suffer youthful failed marriages.Enchanted was great fun, and very funny! A must see!"
953,tt0461770,7,"'Enchanted' looks like a movie that a guy would never be seen at. C'mon, it's another Disney princess, and just looks pretty girly, right? Well, this is true. But it is funny enough to make both males and females enjoy a film where Disney pokes fun at their own masterpieces in the form of a Cinderella, Snow White, or Sleeping Beauty.Princess Giselle leaves the cartoon world for the real world, and has a whale of a time adjusting to the harsh realities of a life other than ""happy ever after."" This is where the movie is at its best, as Amy Adams is very funny and cute playing a princess who must adjust to life in New York City while bringing her very own charm to the real world, and teaches lessons about true love while also learning important aspects of relationships from the man who is lucky- or unlucky?- enough to have found her.The ending is kind of weird, but that's not to spoil a movie that is for the most part refreshing in its premise and delivers plenty of genuine laughs. 3/4 stars"
954,tt0461770,8,"This is really the definition of ""light entertainment,"" and seriously, I am still smiling about it now. After getting in the way of an Evil Queen, a fairytale princess is cast into an alternate reality--the real world as we know it--and must survive there until her rescue by her Prince Charming. Hmm! From the trailer I saw, my guess was that ""Enchanted"" was a one-joke show, a series of gags about how fairytale magic falls on its face in the real world. That Disney has managed to squeeze at least four or five good jokes out of the idea, and mixed in a few sprinkles of profundity on top of that, is something of an achievement. As a romp, it works fairly well, and it delivered quite a lot more than I was expecting. This is a risky film to make, and Disney gets points for having the guts to unleash this oddity on the holiday season. It's a fun film that isn't afraid to go, occasionally, in weird and startling directions. The intersection of the two worlds--the world of faith and magic, and the world of disillusionment and hard reality--creates the expected comedic drama at first. Then the two opposing realities begin to influence and change each other in unsettling and stimulating ways that may surprise the audience. The ideas aren't fully developed, but a crucial detail was attended to at the wrap-up that satisfied me--the main characters succeed mainly because they are able to grow beyond their previous conceptions of themselves.Along the way of telling this story, we get to see a very challenging film production featuring two distinct worlds and their accompanying designs, and the intermingling of these two worlds. It's occasionally heavy on visual effects and animated sequences, but the effects are always story-driven and never gratuitous--a surprising enough thing nowadays that it's worth taking note of. Strong film-making skills, with an old-school sensibility, are at work.My rating gets an extra point for an audacious, overblown MGM-style singing/dancing sequence, the kind that is rarely seen in theatres nowadays. Go see it!"
955,tt0465234,6,"National Treasure: Book of Secrets is a decent film. Nothing more, nothing less. I came out of the theater content, and yet by the next hour I'd forgotten much of what had taken place. Such is the case for most films now, however.Compared to the first film, the plot is weak (certainly not as tightly drawn as the former) but the energy is the same and the humor is the same, and overall it's still as watchable as the first. Helen Mirren and Ed Harris were also very good, and somewhat surprising, additions to the cast.Essentially, the movie is on the ridiculous/unbelievable side, but it's worth a watch. I don't think I'd pay another 10 dollars to see it again in theaters, but waiting for a rental will do."
956,tt0465234,7,"During a lecture about John Wilkes Booth and Thomas Gates, Ben Gates (Nicolas Cage) and his father Patrick Gates (Jon Voight) are surprised by Mitch Wilkinson (Ed Harris) that claims that their ancestor was a conspirator in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln based on the missing page of Booth's diary that he possesses. The outraged Ben decides to prove the honor of his ancestor and together with his wife Abigail (Diane Kruger) and his best friend, the writer Riley Poole (Justin Bartha), they head to France, England and Washington to collect clues to lead them to a lost city of gold Cinola and clean the name of Thomas Gates. But Mitch Wilkinson is following each step of Ben and his friends to take the merit of finding the treasure for himself.""National Treasure: Book of Secrets"" is an entertaining and full of action adventure that follows the style of Indiana Jones combined with ""Da Vinci Code. The story is developed in high pace, with likable characters and funny situations. Nicolas Cage and the gorgeous German Diane Kruger show a wonderful chemistry and Jon Voight, Justin Bartha and Helen Mirren give a magnificent support. Ed Harris is a very confused and ambiguous villain and his true motives are never clear, Harvey Keitel has a minor role and Bruce Greenwood performs again the role of president of the United States of America that seems to be tailored for this great actor. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""A Lenda do Tesouro Perdido – Livro dos Segredos"" (""The Legend of the Lost Treasure – Book of Secrets"")"
957,tt0465234,7,"I will keep it short and simple. Just watched it, paid 10$ for it, it is worth it. Not much of details as you would expect out of a great movie, not much of substance in the movie itself however the acting and the pace of the movie is so beautiful you wont think of the flaws in the intricate plans they carry out in the movie. The subtle comedy is really nice and they have kept the first movie in consideration and have not brought many new characters. It is not a movie that you would think a lot about after you come out of the hall, however you will not think anything else either while the movie is going on. I will give it 7 for the sheer value of entertainment and nothing else and of course the one liners that keep popping up which actually make you laugh."
958,tt1127884,4,"How can anyone watch this and not be thinking- give it ten more years and she'll be shaving her head? I hope with all my heart that it won't come to pass, but this overproduced and overblown effort to create stardom for the sake of stardom is mind-blowing. Miley has a pleasant enough voice, but all the bells and whistles (and pyrotechnics and massive financial expenditures) are definitely putting the cart before the horse- she hasn't risen to stardom, she has been shoved up there by folks seeking the all-mighty dollar. And the few moments showing Miley's mother are downright eerie- she's focused on the girl as if it is a life or death event, not an entertainment production. No smiles, no enjoying the music- she looks like a cat watching a canary in a cage. When interviewed, she seems to think helping her daughter with costume changes is the main proof that she's a concerned mom. Time may prove me wrong and that'd be a great thing, because statistically speaking child stars pushed to the top by obsessive parents just don't seem to do well in the long run. In summary, lots of flash, non-memorable music. But I am grateful to see that Miley and her backup group can dance well without resorting to oversexed bumps and grinds."
959,tt1127884,3,this was no more than a money making stunt that is working. the only reason that this movie is a hit is due to the kids that like Miley Cyrus. I do think that everyone that was in the so called movie should have received compensation as an extra just like they would in a real movie. it's no more than a music video. The adding of the Jonas Bro was another marketing ploy to generate money.If Miley Cyrus wants to hit the big screen she should go about it through a real movie. She does have talent but she will not expand herself through this type promotions.She should talk to the Olsen twins for some pointers or go with a new manager. someone is not doing there job here
981,tt0499448,8,"Director Andrew Adamson, who helmed the first installment in the series, after making his career primarily in animation (including the original ""Shrek"") seems decidedly more comfortable in his role as a live action director this time around, and he handles the scope and the pacing of this epic adventure with a polished skill that is a very pleasant surprise. In addition, Georgie Henley, Skandar Keynes, William Moseley and Anna Popplewell, returning as the Pevensie children, have matured, not only physically, but in their acting ability. There is a deftness and self assuredness this time around that surpasses the original, and makes for an extremely entertaining film.The story begins with Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes), nephew of Miraz (Sergio Castellito), the leader of the ""Telmarines,"" the human population that is now the dominant race in Narnia, fleeing for his life when Miraz's wife gives birth to a son. Miraz usurped the throne from the rightful King, Caspian's father, and now that he has an heir of his own, he wants Caspian out of the way for good.Meanwhile, back in London, Peter and his siblings are trying to adjust to life in the real world. Peter is getting into fights because he can't bear people ""treating him like a kid,"" after growing to adulthood before leaving Narnia, only to return at the exact age he was when he first stepped through the wardrobe. But in less time than it takes to board the London underground, the Pevensie's are once again transported back to the magical kingdom - only it is not the place they left. Over a thousand years have passed, and the castle of Cair Paravel lies in ruins. As the children struggle to find out what has happened, they stumble upon a Dwarf named Trumpkin (Peter Dinklage), who is being taken prisoner by abusive Telmarine soldiers. Susan, who doesn't seem to have had much opportunity to show off her finely honed archery skills at home in Finchley, eagerly takes the opportunity to rescue Trumpkin from his captors, and the surly old dwarf (whom Lucy and Edmund nickname ""The D.L.F."", or ""Dear Little Friend,"") explains that all is not well in Narnia. It seems that not long after the High King Peter and his siblings left Narnia, the land was plunged into a dark age, and the Telmarines have ruled for hundreds of years with an iron fist. The days of the many creatures, including talking beasts, living in harmony together, have long since passed, and no one has seen or heard of Aslan the Lion in centuries. And what's more, the trees are no longer friends to the Narnians - they are just normal, everyday trees.It doesn't take long before the children meet up with Caspain, who is hiding out in the forest with a misfit band of followers, and soon the young would be heroes join forces in a plot to reclaim Narnia for the Narnians, and place Caspian, the rightful heir, on the throne.The film moves along at a steady, exciting pace, with skillfully staged action and suspense that will have audience members on the edge of their seats, and while in general it stays very faithful to the source material, there is quite a bit of added embellishment to make for a grander and more spectacular epic, with added battle and chase sequences that are deftly handled and add to the story and the level of excitement, where in less skilled hands they could have easily overtaken it. The level of action, and violence, is really quite a bit stronger than in the first film, and the film has a darker, grittier tone, which makes it something of a surprise that the filmmakers got away with a PG rating for what is clearly a PG-13 film. As mentioned before, the actors really step up to the plate this time, in particularly Keynes and Moseley as Peter and Edmund. But the most delightful performances come from the great Peter Dinklage (known for his brilliantly subtle turn in ""The Station Agent,"" and perhaps best remembered as the diminutive author of children's books in ""Elf"") and Reepicheep, a bold and chivalrous mouse (voice of Eddie Izzard), who really steals the show. The effects are absolutely top notch, and in the final third the movie reaches such a fever pitch of excitement that it recalls Peter Jackson's ""The Two Towers,"" arguably the most exciting installment of the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy.So, in the end, ""Prince Caspian"" may not be the profound allegorical tale that ""The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe"" was, or reach the same level of magical wonder, but it more than succeeds at what it sets out to do, and strongly indicates that there is a future in the Narnia franchise."
961,tt1127884,8,"I just took my 9 year old cousin to see this tonight. The only downfall was that I had not been prepared for the $15 ticket price, but I grinned and beared it, knowing that my cousin was super excited. I went into the movie thinking that I was going to regret the price I had just paid. Surprisingly, I came out not feeling too bad about it at all.First of all, it was a 3D concert and I was a little worried at the beginning. Initially, there were a lot of huge effects and sweeping camera angles that became a little dizzying. But when it settled into the actual concert portion, I felt just fine. Before I saw this movie, I had always thought of Miley as a somewhat mediocre performer. I changed my mind after tonight. That girl has got so much energy and talent, I was thoroughly impressed! The behind-the-scenes clips were fun, because we got a glimpse of the making of it and got to see how Miley's personality outside of performing.All of the well-known songs from the T.V. show were performed along w/ some new ones from Miley(not Hannah, to make the distinction). I think I might have enjoyed the Miley section even more than the Hannah part. She even performed a very sweet song that she had written for her grand-father who had passed away. The Jonas Brothers were as adorable as could be. Unfortunately, they didn't perform my favorite song, S.O.S. But we did get to hear When You Look Me in the Eyes and Year 3000 while Miley changed from Hannah into Miley. All in all, I thought it was a perfect show for kids and grown-ups alike. If you didn't get the chance to go to one of her actual concerts, I think that this was the next best thing. I know that I had a blast and I'm in my 20's! :)"
962,tt1127884,7,"Took my girls, 14 and 11, since couldn't get them concert tickets...and it was worth it, although pricey (still, cheaper than the actual concert would have been - and I did not have to drive into the city during rush hour has I would have had we scored concert tickets!). Favorite moments - seeing the dads desperate for concert tickets running races in high heels! The behind the scene moments where the real teenage girl came through. Also - this film showed my girls how much WORK goes into being a pop star, with all the rehearsals, planning - the sheer amount of WORK everyone involved had to do to move this large production on the road."
963,tt1127884,1,"Okay, I know at this point Miley Cyrus is probably on the upper hand of morality in comparison to other teen icons. But am I the only one who gets sick of this type of thing? Various companies (in this case Disney) overly promote an up-and-coming teenage singer or actor, sucks the originality out of it, then makes us sick to our stomach with it. During this period of time, millions of preteens look up to them with little puppy dog eyes, then they pull something off that's really dumb, and then look at the example kids look up to. Let's go through teen stars. Hilary Duff is seen occasionally, but look at ""Material Girls"". Not exactly a movie to be proud of. Jamie Lynn Spears got pregnant at 16. While this is quite common and I'm not saying they're bad people, but they've made mistakes. Next, Lindsay Lohan. Britney Spears. Enough said.Wasn't there a point when most every one of these stars was Ms. Teen Incredible? Now don't we frown up them? I'm not saying every child star hasn't had a major earth-shattering problem, but these days, aren't more child stars turning into pretentious teens with babies that grew up listening to the same music their parents grew up listening to? I pray every night that in 10 years we won't be watching our kids' icons shave their head and end up in rehab before they can legally drink, but aren't the odds going against them. Is there a parent out there right now that can't be imagining this while they watch this movie?As for the film itself, I'm not going to say that Miley Cyrus doesn't have a better voice than a large number of celebrity teens that try and start careers with lackluster talent, but is this anything special? I can't help think the same thing with the Jonas Brothers. You've got people like LeAnn Rimes and Jodie Foster that started at least this young an moved on to multi-Grammy and Oscar winning careers. There are few worse things to do than watch wannabe stars parade around pretending they're kings and queens of their worlds. What'll happen when the novelty of these Disney-made stars wears off? They'll never shake that image. 3D special effects were excellent, but the things they effect are so depressing that they're wasted.I know I'm blunt and agree with the cynical speculators that question what'll happen to these kids, but I can't apologize for what I think."
964,tt1127884,1,I took my 8 yr old daughter to see this just yesterday. I wasn't happy about having to see it myself but I know my daughter had been asking to go so I did it for her. Miley is a likable girl and I hope she can stay the course of being a good role model for younger kids. I also seem to think that she has a lot riding on her as the lead for all this Hanna Montana promotion and she seems to take it well. Hopefully she wont go the way of Britney or Linsday. Kids need someone to look up to when they are young. But this movie/concert is not for sane adults. I closed my eyes through a lot of the Jonas Bros. and Miley concert footage. The only things that were vaguely entertaining were the behind-the-scenes footage. The concert itself is fairly mundane for most sane adults.
965,tt1127884,1,"Greed. Greed. Shameless greed. Gouging the public is bad enough, but targeting 8 to 12 year-old girls is just horrific.Let's teach our daughters a valuable lesson about exploitation and skip this marketing fluff. Let's say ""NO"" to this greedy, overblown, and mediocre talent that Disney is trying to push on our impressionable daughters.Their shrewd scheme to create an artificial demand by using over-inflated ticket prices is just another reason to boycott Disney.My daughter has been a huge Hannah Montana fan. I've seen the TV show a few times, it was OK but nothing special. I was stupid and allowed my daughter to buy her CD's and video games. But no more. My daughter will not be buying any more Hannah Montana garbage.160 bucks for a concert, I laughed and said ""No way sweetie"" to that. Then 15 bucks a ticket for a movie, I just pulled my money back and told the cashier no thanks!Please people, don't pay another dime on this scam. Its time to punish these people. Please, please, please ... boycott this film and the Hannah Montana show & merchandise. They are so shameless and the worst example of greed that I've ever seen aimed at young girls."
966,tt1127884,1,"Do not waste your time or money on this absolutely terrible Movie! This is an obvious attempt to cash in on the Hannah Montana fame. Unfortunately, she has NO talent! It was painful to watch and the soundtrack is just terrible! This poor kid really has no talent! She is nothing but a Spears wannabe! This definitely is her 15 minutes of fame! A truly complete waste of film! You can tell she lip-synced many of the songs. Stay away and don't waste your money! There are a lot more talented singers who deserve a look. This is one trashy teenage movie! My daughter really hated this movie! Hannah Montana, I hope your 15 minutes is just about up!"
967,tt1127884,1,Since this review has to have 10 lines for a decent review - here is what I have to put in words.If swearing was allowed in this review I could go on for hours about how bad this movie was.If I could give it any stars it would be 0 stars out of 10.Instead I gave it a generous 1 star out of 10 cos it was a god damn awful movie.I only watched this for 5 minutes cos I was forced to watch it.I got enough material for this review.I just went to my room cos I was angry cos I hate Miley Cyrus/Hannah Montana so much.After my anger cooled down I couldn't help but laugh with scorn cos it was so laughable.People shouldn't be wasting their money to see this fake singerI really feel bad for anyone who likes Hannah Montana cos of three reasons 1. She CANT SING nor ACT 2. Is a bad role model and isn't worth sticking up for 3. She is fake and is a TOTAL Brit wannabeWatch this only if nothing else is on TV.It is definitely one of the biggest pieces of sh*t i have ever seen and If you like it YOU HAVE NO TASTE in movies.
968,tt0997047,6,"I honestly don't see what the big fuss over College Road Trip is. It wasn't a bad movie, in my opinion. It was actually really lovable, and even though it was certainly mediocre most of the time, and I felt as if at some parts they tried too hard to please the audience with mediocre jokes, it was still very entertaining, and contained a pretty good amount of laughable, and that's laughable in the humorous way, material.It was also nice seeing Raven Symone in this movie, because I am always used to seeing her in what she's famous for, That's So Raven, and it was enlightening to know she played a role, because I love her in that show. Also, even though Martin Lawrence isn't one of the best actors, and definitely isn't one of my favorites, he's not a terrible one, and if you ask me everyone in this movie could act well for their roles, to some extent. There were scenes where I felt as if the antics were outdated and some lines were just not pulled off to the best of the casts' abilities, but when it was over I ended up having fun with it, and that's what it was meant to be in the first place.It was of course no masterpiece, and it could have been handled a lot more professionally than it was, but doesn't a ton of movies fall under those categories, and yet, many people enjoy them. Overall, it was a good little movie, that isn't as horrible as the rating and negative comments let on to be, so if you're any bit interested in seeing this movie, go ahead, because it wasn't bad or disappointing at all."
969,tt0997047,6,"I watched this movie because I like to watch Martin Lawrence movies.This is a family movie. There is no swearing, there is no violence, etc. It's the way family movies should be. The storyline isn't the best nor is the musical score or acting however, it is not as bad as others deem it to be. I think too many people expect to be entertained by movies as if it was the first time being on a roller coaster. Those types of movies are jewels and should be praised as such however, these types of movies (college road trip) should not be condemned by seemingly heartless people who think they are experts in how movies should be. I often wonder if these people actually sit through and watch movies or just make bad comments because they don't like a particular actor. Oh well. I liked this movie."
970,tt0997047,7,"My kids and I really enjoyed this movie. The kids loved it so much, they saw it twice. The ""Double Dutch Bus"" scene was just terrific. Donny Osmond's character was so funny and I was glad my kids got a chance to see him since I was a big fan of him back in the '70's. The kids are big fans of Lucus Gabriel and Raven and I thought they gave great performances. Raven is such a talented person. I liked how her character in the movie was ambitious and determined to excel academically and still have friends and be pretty. We also enjoyed the scenes in the sorority with the stern Sorority supervisor. Nice to see all those college girls being supervised! And Grandma with her friends were big fun. The pig added a lot to the movie's fun and it was so cute. Although he did a fine job with the material, Martin Lawrence was a bit wasted in this movie. The kids didn't notice cause they don't know how incredibly funny he can be. The overall best thing about this movie was the music. The music had us dancing in our theater seats; we can't wait to get the sound track of this movie."
971,tt0997047,9,"OK, this isn't the movie I would select if just my husband and I were going out for the evening. But WE aren't the audience for this- Disney made this for kids and tweens and YES even teens. I have 3 daughters 13, 11, 7, and this movie hit the notes right for THEM. The interplay between Raven's character Melanie and her friends was right on. There is a scene where Melanie's Dad (Lawrence) and she are in the car, and she is on her cell phone forever with their friends- it is so true to life and you would only know that if you've experienced this.In terms of appropriateness for kids, I can't think of anything in this movie that would offend. There is silly slapstick comedy that had adults and kids alike laughing. Kids who watched Raven on her Disney channel show loved watching her act in this movie. The Donny Osmond character was over the top and, according to my 7 year old, totally hilarious.Would I select this movie just for me? NO. But folks, if you are looking for a movie for the family to see, or something I could show a mixed age group, this is great. I could pick apart little things about the movie, but those parts of the movie I found to be silly or ridiculous were irrelevant to the kids. This movie both has a heart and is sweet in spirit. I wish more people would CONSIDER the AUDIENCE for whom the movie is intended when writing a review."
972,tt0997047,5,"This film goes to show that you can be on top of the world and fall all the way down. With ""Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins"",""Wild Hogs"" and now ""College Road Trip"" under Lawrence's belt, i don't know how much more he can take. This movie is pretty standard ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" film. With all the sight gags and kiddy jokes about pigs and dancing, and, of course the soft spot for tolerance. Donny Osmond was straight forward in this film and Lawrence was really exaggerated as a goofy dad. Raven Symone played a OK part, but not a real big leap forward for the young actress. Of course, this doesn't mean the film is all bad. The movie, in its quirky way is funny. With its zany comedy style, like animal humor and kiss jokes...this film reaches to little kids. If you have young ones, this wont be bad for them, but for you...its okay."
973,tt0997047,8,"I know not many people enjoyed this film, but I really did! I did go to see the film, NOt the actors, so I was VERY pleased when I saw Lucas Grabeel as one of the characters (Especially since HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL is one of my favorite films!) I really enjoyed the movie... a great idea for high school seniors! ALso... for Lucas fans... don't worry, his BEST scene is in the last minute of the film... LiterallY!I enjoyed it and I think that it was funA great family filmI hope you enjoy itI really do!"
974,tt0997047,8,I agree that this movie was predictable and simple...but you guys obviously did not take your kids with you. My daughter loves Raven from her Cheetah Girls movies. She is a spectacular role model for girls and her movies are about having fun and doing responsible things as a young woman unlike most of the movies out there with girls as their stars. Most of them focus on chasing boys. She is the positive role model parents pray for.My girlfriends and I love Martin Lawrence. The faces he pulls never get old. He's got charisma and as soon as he's on screen everyone is smiling. He's the kind of guy that lightens the mood and I know many many people who love seeing him on screen. How can you not like a guy that brings giggles with a gesture or funny face?If you have daughters take them to see this movie. It's a great kids movie.
1312,tt2140373,9,"This movie is much more than and definitely deeper than one would suspect from the 'syrupy' trailers most people have seen. The understory, gradually revealing the early life of P.L. Travers, the author of Mary Poppins, and depicting how the people in her dysfunctional family led her to write Mary Poppins, is the true core of this movie. I will never see Mary Poppins in quite the same way. All of the acting is superior, and the score is excellent. This is not the shallow, childlike movie that many will expect. I would not recommend it for children 11 and under, depending on the child. Otherwise, I highly recommend this movie, even if you are not a big fan of the original Mary Poppins film."
975,tt0997047,7,"I saw this movie when it came out and it was so funny! It was kind of stupid in a few scenes, but wow, it was one of the funniest movies! I love Raven in this, she was the perfect pick! I can't imagine anyone else playing her character. Also Martin Lawrence's character isn't exactly how some dads are. But still, he did a great job betraying an over protected, police dad. And this is his first G-rated film! Can you believe it? So anyways, I loved this movie. Donny Osmand's character and his daughter are so annoying but that makes it even funnier! I loved it when at the end the daughter of Donny goes to the same college as Raven and they're neighbors! So funny. Loved the movie and the plot line wasn't the best. I know this won't be Golden Globe or Oscar worthy, but it'll definitely be nominated the the Teen Choice awards and/or at the MTV movies awards. If it doesn't get those nominations, I'll be kind of surprised. Anyways, if you want some good family fun, go see this movie! It's worth it!"
976,tt0997047,8,College Road Trip was a pretty funny movie. It wasn't as funny as I thought it would be but it was funny enough. It was well made. In the beginning I thought it was going to be bad the way the first half started but then it got really good. There were also a ton of great messages in this movie. Im not a big fan of Raven Symone but she actually did a pretty good job for her first big movie hit. I find her very annoying and it seems like she never knows when to shut up. I thought that this was a very different movie for Martin Lawrence. Although it was a different type of movie for him he nailed the part. A bad thing about this movie was that it seemed like it copied of of a couple movies in several scenes. One of the movies were Penelope. The direction in this movie was fairly good. The message was about being able to let your kids grow up and having trust in them. This movie does show that life does go by really fast. That fact is true about life going by way to fast. So in that case you should spend more time with your kids and live life to the fullest. I didn't like Martin Lawrences wife in the movie that much. I thought that she did a good job despite me not liking her. They also found a mother that looked a little bit like Raven Symone which was smart. One of my favorite scenes in the movie was when the father and daughter went sky diving. It goes to show you that a father can get along with his daughter and have deep conversations. The person I saw this movie with teared a little bit at the end. So I guess it was like a little bit of a tear jerker to some people and maybe you to. This is a perfect movie for you to see to if you are going to college soon. It was more of a little kids type of movie but also the whole family can enjoy it to. It really gives you a good outlook of what college is going to be like. The story was also very cute. Overall this movie was pretty good and a very cute family movie.
977,tt0997047,8,"Okay some of you may think of Raven Symone has someone who is not funny, and is over the top for the most part, like she is on Disney's That's So Raven(2003-2007), I'm amazed she still has a career after that. But her performance was memorable and not over the top. She plays Melaine Porter, a graduate from High School, who wants to go George Town college, but her overprotective dad police chief James Porter(the very funny Martin Lawerence) wants her to go to Northwestern, in hopes she'll be closer to home. He decides to on a College Road Trip with her, and that is all you need to hear. Raven Symone is not a truly great actress, but still manages to be entertaining, and avoids being called the worst actress ever. She and Martin Lawerence are funny together, they play off each other so well. It is also the funniest road comedy since Are We There Yet(2005)."
978,tt0499448,6,"Last warning for spoilers:After falling in love with ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe,"" I was expecting an amazing sequel from the same people. ""Prince Caspian"" was a disappointment, however.The changes made from the book were so many and extreme that Adamson (the director) completely altered the theme of the story. The character of Peter was so changed that one questions what exactly he learned from Narnia that he will not be allowed to return. From the fighting at the beginning of the film in England because he is upset about being young again to the power struggles with Caspian, his title of ""The Magnificent"" was sullied.Caspian fared no better. In making him an adult and Miraz the Lord Regent, they made a crown Prince not even knowledgeable about the fact that the throne is his and that no other Lords who are suspicious of Miraz ever talking to Caspian about his birthright. That is unrealistic. Even worse, they turned Caspian into a vengeful man who jeopardized a mission to attempt to avenge his father's death.What was worse, however, was that Adamson chose action and battle scenes to character development. There were so many characters introduced but none of them were rounded out. It felt as if the characters were background to the action. They did what they did because they were supposed to rather than any meaningful reason due to their personality.As a Narnia book series fan, this was a major disappointment. It really felt like Adamson redid a mediocre medieval war movie adding Narnian characters for effect.Bob"
979,tt0499448,6,"I am a Narnia obsessed nerd, so of course I went to see it the night it was released. I had very high expectations because the first movie was so true to the book. However, with this film that wasn't the case. The screen play was pretty much completely rewritten and included only hints of the original story. I suppose Disney felt it necessary to add in lame typical movie elements that attract mainstream moviegoers. For example a sub-plot romance between Caspian and Susan and battles that never existed. This movie not only failed to develop the characters and events as well as the book, it changed the characters and situations that it did develop."
980,tt0499448,5,"If you've never read the novel by C.S. Lewis, you will probably think ""Prince Caspian"" is a terrific movie. However, if you enjoyed reading the book, prepare to be disappointed.The most beastly fault in the movie is the portrayal of several key characters. Peter is made out to be a whining, ego-centric child as opposed to his true character as the High King of Narnia. In the opening scenes, Peter is found fighting other children at a train station in London. You find out that Peter started the fight because he doesn't like being treated like a child, a theme which would continue throughout the movie.Caspian is portrayed as a true adolescent; rebelling against Peter's decisions and seeking personal vendettas including a developing love affair with Queen Susan (what's that all about?). This move did a great job of making Caspian look like a pompous ass.At one point in the movie, Peter decides to attack Miraz's castle against the council of Caspian and others. The plan takes a turn for the worse when Caspian discovers that Miraz killed his father and attempts to assassinate Miraz in his bed chambers. That goes badly, alarms are set off, Narnians retreat leaving several behind. Fingers are pointed at Peter for wanting some glorious victory and back at Caspian for not sticking to the plan. Meanwhile I'm sitting in my seat wondering if I'd missed a chapter or two when I last read the book.The last atrocity I'll discuss is the meaning behind seeing Aslan. Faith and Christianity are profound points in C.S. Lewis's novels, and I'll just say that this movie missed the mark yet again.It would be ridiculous to believe a movie could follow a book to the letter. However, what this movie did to the characters is cinematic murder."
982,tt0499448,1,"Since the Chronicles of Narnia are a series of widely read and revered books I had to give my first rating of a 1 for this film. We went opening night and I was very disappointed and my wife was in tears by the end because of her disappointment. So much of Lewis' humor was lost in favor of an action movie plot with running battles, some added that aren't in the book while other important pieces from the book are left out. It became just one long tedious battle. And a romance between Caspian & Susan? We love those books so very, very much that it was painful to watch. Our children ages 21, 18 & 15, who were raised on Narnia, were not just disappointed but angry... My eldest daughter was livid. Her close friend whom we had introduced to Narnia just two years ago was very unhappy with what was left out of the film not to mention all that was added. My wife and I felt it was as if the person who wrote the screenplay hadn't read the books at all. Two revealing things we noticed too were during the opening credits with Actors and Directors and Producers names in huge type, it seemed to us that ""From a book by C.S. Lewis"" was in much smaller type. Also, during the previews of coming attractions, there was another fantasy movie advertised and it had in large print, ""From a writer of the Chronicles of Narnia"". They must have been referring to a screenwriter, but it was very aggravating! There was only one author of the Chronicles of Narnia and it was C.S. Lewis! Interestingly, they decided to cast all the Telemarines as evil Spaniards. I found that fascinating and would like to know the rationale behind that? In the books, the girls do not participate as warriors, Aslan having said war is unpleasant and decidedly so if girls participate. However, in the movie, Susan is a major warrior and is seen leading Narnians and firing her arrows into Telemarines all over the place. At the final climax and their departure from Narnia, (she and Peter for the last time) she and Prince Caspian first exchange longing glances, which you've been aware of all throughout the film, and then they passionately kiss! I'm all for that of course, but not in this movie about this book... to quote a little boy who was sitting with his grandfather in front of us, ""That was yucky!"""
983,tt0499448,1,"I'm obligated to say that this review contains ""spoilers,"" but I use this term reservedly since I'm not sure this movie can really be spoiled. At least, I'm not sure how you would be able to tell.Einstein's famous equation E=mc^2, part of his theory of relativity, explains how it is physically impossible for the opening chapters of Lewis' ""Prince Caspian"" to be rushed through any more quickly than was done by Adamson's abomination of the same name. It literally made me dizzy. I'll just lay it out there and get it over with; Adamson follows the storyline of the book very well. In the book, the Pevensies come to Narnia, help Caspian gain his rightful throne, and then go home; Andrewson has all three of these things happen in the movie. That's about where the similarities end. In a pathetically feeble attempt to keep fans of the book happy, Andrewson plugs in a few scenes or references from the book that don't interfere with his plot. At first, it's kind of interesting to see what kind of events he makes up to tie in the other events he made up with the events from the book. We miss this later in the movie, though, as he pretty much abandons the events from the book until the end. All this happens because he really wants the Pevensies to meet up with Caspian earlier; I have absolutely no idea why this was so important to him. It doesn't really add anything and it wreaks havoc with the storyline. In his determination to be as faithful as possible to the spirit of the book, Adamson hacks out all the events in Narnia that lead up to the blowing of the horn and almost all of the Pevensie's journey to Aslan's How. Shockingly, cutting out the first half of Lewis' story and replacing it with his own leaves the scenes taken from Lewis' story, both those later in the movie and the few scenes randomly inserted in the beginning, seeming somewhat incongruous and forced. You can almost tell what scenes or dialogue are from the book even if you haven't read it, simply by noticing the discontinuity. Whenever, a character seems to be acting out of a character or a scene seems to have little to do with the plot, it's probably from the book.I can't imagine what could make this Andrewson character (his real name is Andrew Adamson, by the way) think he has the artistic credentials to make such a massive revision to such a great work. It's not like he's on the short list for a lifetime achievement award here. Does he honestly think he can improve on Lewis? Does he realize that the whole reason this movie is being made is because so many people love Lewis' story? Does he think Lewis' plot isn't good enough? It's not like Lewis' story lacked dramatic tension or action or character development. Andrewson didn't supply what was lacking, he just changed for no apparent reason, exhibiting monumental arrogance in the process. I'm going to harp some more on this because it really baffles me, what was gained by all these revisions? Did Andrewson just decide to use Lewis' story as a platform for his own ideas because he has no respect for a great author, or did he actually have the arrogance to think he could somehow improve on or tell Lewis' story better than Lewis could? I wish I could know what was going through his mind ""hey, I just read this book by a guy named Siyes Lewis, or something like that. Alright, I really just skimmed it. The point is, it gave me some great ideas for a movie"" ""Look, Lewis spends way too much time with the Pevensies once they get to Narnia. This movie is not about the Pevensies. I'll have them immediately find Cair Paravel, immediately recognize it as Cair Paravel, immediately rescue the dwarf (whatever-his-name-is) and leave Cair Paravel, and almost immediately get to Aslan's How. That way I can spend more time with the central characters, the Telmarines, who Lewis barely even thinks to mention during this time. Plus, I really need to develop the Telmarines for the viewers since I cut out the whole beginning of the book where Lewis did that."" If Andrewson feels no ethical constraint to respect the integrity of another artist's work, you would think he would at least be bright enough to realize that the easiest way to make a brilliant movie is to stick as closely as possible to the brilliant book. That's what Peter Jackson did with Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, and it worked out okay for him."
984,tt0499448,8,"This movie isn't half as charming or eloquently magical as the first, but it engages nonetheless.There's something about the young actors chosen to play the four major roles- Peter, Edmund, Susan and Lucy. They badly make you wish you were in their shoes. The film in itself is often reminiscent of LOTR, but the major difference being in a childlike simplicity this one retains.Aslan, despite not having much of a role, manages to be the most striking character, and Lucy is as lovable as she was in the first film.The battle scenes are brilliant, as are the landscapes. The power politics and senselessness of violence are dealt with a lot maturely in this film as compared to the first installment. At some point you realize you want at least a dozen more films revolving around these four siblings, and to be able to access Narnia for ever.The only thing that ruins this film is this strange invasion of Hollywood-like romance as a very annoying little subplot, and the sudden intrusion of a ridiculous song at a climactic point.Apart from that, I am pretty sure any fantasy-hound would enjoy this film a lot, and especially so if you're a big Lewis fan.I know I am."
985,tt0499448,1,"I was completely disappointed with the movie. I've read Prince Caspian numerous times. The movie was terrible. It fundamentally changed many of the important characters. Aslan, the key character of the book, was emasculated. Peter, originally portrayed as true to Aslan throughout the story came across as a spoiled teenager. The scene in which the White Witch is nearly called back was terrible as well. In the book, neither Caspian nor Peter were tempted to bring her back. The invented romance between Caspian and Susan was awful as well. Don't waste the money on the movie. Buy the book, or get the Focus on the Family Radio Theatre version of Prince Caspian (and the rest of the Chronicles of Narnia)."
986,tt0499448,2,"Disney continues the C.S. Lewis' Narnia tales, but this time makes a boring, over-long, disappointing movie.The setup: After returning to England for a year, the four Pevensie siblings respond to a horn calling for help and return to the magical land of Narnia, only to find that in Narnia 1,300 years have passed. Their old castle is in ruins, and it develops that Narnia has been conquered by some people called Telmarines, who have the accents, spade beards, and helmets of stereotypical Spanish conquistadors. Prince Caspian, who called for help, is one of'em, but his uncle wants him dead so the uncle can become king. The intrepid Pevensie quartet size up the situation and decide to help Caspian and simultaneously rid Narnia of the invaders, with the aid of the usual Narnian characters, including dwarfs, centaurs, a talking badger, and a talkative mouse whose manner & dialog were stolen from Antonio Banderas' Puss-in-Boots in ""Shrek 2"". Aslan makes a brief but effective (plotwise) appearance near the end but my fave villainess, Tilda Swinton as the White Witch, has only an all-too-short cameo.I thought the plot was erratically developed and the dialog occasionally funny but pretty much unimaginatively routine for high-fantasy stories. My big problem was that I was never brought to care for any of the characters, whose motivations are murky. The young cast put no emotion into their parts.I found myself realizing that I was bored several times during the flick's 2 hour & 24 minute length. The whole purpose of the movie seemed to be just to set up the big climactic CGI battle at the end. Unfortunately, the CGI was not up to Peter Jackson's standards, even tho it included a forest of trees that turned into Ents and a flood that copied a scene from ""The Fellowship of the Ring"".My favorite moment came in a scene toward the end, when Prince Caspian had his evil uncle at sword point, with both characters talking in their Spanish accents. I wanted to yell out the perfect line for our hero to say: ""My name is Prince Caspian. You murdered my father. Prepare to die!"" Heck, since most of the flick was derivative of the ""Lord of the Rings"" movies, why not throw in some ""Princess Bride"", too?"
987,tt0499448,1,"According to the Wikipedia article, the directors decided to take ""Caspian"" in a darker direction -- and boy howdy, did they succeed! C.S. Lewis's ""Prince Caspian"" was a bright and cheering children's book; Andrew Adamson's ""Caspian"" is a morally ambiguous soap opera filled with horrific battle scenes. Lewis centered ""Caspian"" around the children's trek to Aslan's How, on which Lucy, then Edmund, Peter, and finally Susan begin to see Aslan ahead of them on the trail; but this central scene is only alluded to in the movie with a couple of lines of bad dialogue. The next most important scene, the ""Romp"" with Aslan, is left out entirely, in favor of a bloody battle at Miraz's castle made up by the director.This isn't like the first movie, in which they screwed up the theology. ""Caspian"" presents no theological interest at all. Aslan never appears until the very end, and is presented basically as a ""tame lion"" (he doesn't even shake Trumpkin!). Trumpkin's atheism is played down so far as to be nonexistent; his dialogue implies that he accepts the reality of Aslan from the beginning. While Caspian does reject Nikabrik's evil scheme (the director couldn't very well cut this third critical scene, given that it provided Tilda Swinton's only chance for a cameo), you'll notice that Caspian's army is still full of Minotaurs and Wolves, and early on one character (Trumpkin?) asserts that ""the enemy of my enemy is my friend"" without being rebuked by the children. (Adamson seems to have had something of a minotaur fetish. The battle at the castle is full of lingering shots of dying minotaurs. Never mind that Minotaurs are evil Narnians, or that Lewis's book didn't even mention them.) Adamson adds a pointless and rather insulting ""character flaw"" for Peter (he's turned into a touchy brawler with a chip on his shoulder, whom the now-decent Edmund has to keep saving); Susan's grown-up girliness is communicated mainly by a pointless and rather insulting ""romance"" with Caspian. Edmund, on the other hand, is made out to be a decent guy, which is in keeping with Lewis's book --- perhaps too decent, since the writers give all his catty comments to the others, making even Lucy seem a bit of a prig. (Peter: ""can't keep a map in their heads"". Lucy: ""our Dear Little Friend"".) Yes, the D.L.F. is alluded to in one brief exchange, then promptly forgotten again. Speaking of lost opportunities for comic relief, the Bulgy Bears have disappeared --- is this really a Disney film? The only belly laugh in the movie (albeit totally unintended) is the first bit of Reepicheep's death scene, when the mice's bagpipe music had everyone next to me anxiously checking their cell phones.Oh yeah, and for some reason all the Telmarines (even Caspian himself) speak with thick spaghetti-Western accents, rendering half their lines unintelligible to an American audience. Luckily, they're usually just talking politics, or engaging in bedside Mexican standoffs ripped from the latest telenovela.Zero stars (out of five) for the worst adaptation since Tim Burton's ""Planet of the Apes"". See it if you must, but in the words of Dave Chappelle, ""Better not bring your kids!"" There's nothing in this mess for them."
988,tt1014775,6,"Honestly, I can't help but notice all the people who once again are rating this movie without seeing it and just because they suspect the movie is going to be bad, they rate it anyways as a one. Well, I'm going to once again give you an honest review, I saw this movie last Saturday and honestly enjoyed it. I know I'm going to receive a lot of bashing, but I always look at movies as what they are supposed to be, this was meant to be a children's movie, it's meant for fun. Remember how we all had those cheesy animal movies when we were kids as well? Well Beverly Hills Chihuahua is no different, it's just updated with today's world. I thought it was a good idea, we see all these rich people now-a-days with the way they just lavish their dogs with jewels that cost more than people's houses, it takes a little joke at it. The story is recycled, but it's still a lot fun to watch and has some really fun scenes.Chloe is a Beverly Hills Chihuahua who is just so pampered, with clothes, jewelery, and a life style anyone would die to have. Her owner, Vivian, has to go away on a business trip and leaves her party girl niece, Rachel, to watch Chloe. When they go to Mexico, Chloe is kidnapped and put into a dog fight... she is then saved by another dog, Delgado, who is going to help her get back to Beverly Hills. But when the man who runs the dog fights finds out that Chloe is worth something, he sends his Doberman dog, Diablo, after her. Rachel, the land scaper, Sam, and his dog, Pepi who is also in love with Chloe, are on the hunt to find her and get her home safe and sound.Beverly Hills Chihuahua is a fun movie if you give it a decent chance, I thought it was a nice chance from the constant CGI we always have with these animal stories. I was also impressed that the talking didn't look so fake with the dogs. I tell you though I'm convinced that the dog that played Delgado is the same dog from I Am Legend, that dog just deserves an Oscar, lol, come on, you gotta agree. Well, Beverly Hills Chihuahua is a great family film, as for seeing it on your own or with a friend, I would say that it's worth the rental more so. It's a silly movie I admit, but I had a fun time watching it and I wish IMDb users would give this movie the fair chance it deserves.6/10"
989,tt1014775,5,"I have been using IMDb to obtain feedback on movies for several years now, and what I find is that people here tend to be a little too bias toward A-list, blockbuster movies. Chihuahua does not fall into that category by any means, but that does not warrant dismissing it outright. It is true that the film's cast could have been put to better use, but given the parameters set by the Disney-style writing, they did what they could and it was enough to let me enjoy their performances. I read a review on here that commented on the inaccuracy of geographical information. I agree that if Disney is going to make a film like this, it is unfortunate that they do not take the time to educate their young audiences a little. We wouldn't be talking doctorate level research here, just basic fact-checking.The plot of this movie was not deep, but not many Disney movies NEED to be in order to cater to their young audience and family demographic. I am a twenty-something and I am able to tolerate Disney's material, because I accept it for what it is: shallow, vapid entertainment designed to convey squeaky-clean ideals to impressionable youth. Sometimes, they take that squeaky-cleanliness too far, like making light of the dog fights, but overall, it is all rooted in the same objective: to maintain their target demographic and intake revenue.To the people who reference the different caliber of Disney's entertainment ten or more years ago, I concur with you. It would be good for Disney to trace its roots a bit and return to basics, but it would take a lot of cutting through green to accomplish that.I enjoyed this movie. There was a comment on the discussion board mentioning that the trailer distorted people's initial impression. I am one of those people. Once I got into the movie though, I applied my usual preconditions for judging Disney films and had a good time. It was cute and in Disney's typical fashion, it contained half-baked attempts to teach the kids a thing or two (inaccurate or vague as they were).Go into it knowing it's Disney and will thus inherit the characteristics of all their work, and you'll be fine."
990,tt1014775,7,"I agree with some of the previous reviewers - how can you rate a movie without even seeing it?!? Well, guess that gives us the right to rate THEM without even knowing them! I give those people a 1.5.This is a KID'S movie and to rate it a 2 is ridiculous. It's not the best movie but it sure is much better than A LOT of recent kid's/animated films. My kids, 4 & 5, loved this movie and that's really my biggest requirement. There are many others where they were bored and wanted to leave in less than 30 minutes.To the people voting it so low (especially ones who vote without viewing) - GET A LIFE!"
1313,tt2140373,8,"Walt Disney Pictures rarely aims for the Best Picture crown, being more a company focused on profits and sustaining its wildly popular brand. To make you haters hate more: they've earned $4 billion this year already and this includes the $200 million loss of Lone Ranger). They usually only distribute the movies that have a shot at Academy Awards immortality, with The Help (A Dreamworks film) being the latest example of a nominee and No Country For Old Men being their latest example of a winner.But with Saving Mr. Banks, Disney is going the whole nine yards. With a stellar cast, seemingly endless budget (Giving John Lee Hancock a much-less stressful job in directing), high production value, and heavy dosage of drama that hides beneath the happier movie trailers, this film stands as one of the better dramas of the year and a sure-fire Oscar-contender. Touching upon the tissue-happy themes of forgiveness, family, and seeking happiness in a miserable world, prepare for waterworks throughout the two hours.What makes this movie work more than anything else is the screenplay that didn't start in the studios of Disney, allowing for a more accurate portrayal of the true story behind the making of the masterpiece Mary Poppins----even if the entire world knows that with the backing of Disney some details will be left out. Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith weaved out an engaging story full of crisp dialogue and skillfully avoids becoming too overblown or too overdramatic. And whenever the movie gets close to being all-out depressing, we get treated to humorous moments here and there to keep the audience in check.In a movie about artists that are addicted to their craft, you need actors that work with the same type of fervor. Emma Thompson despite not getting top billing gets the most screen time, gets the toughest job, and delivers the ultimate performance. She becomes very dislikable and yet sympathetic at the same time, and it is impossible to see anyone other than Thompson deliver this type of impact. Tom Hanks in an Oscar-baiting year does a superb job portraying the icon planet Earth knows and loves as he gives Walt Disney a humanized performance that separates the flawed man from the myth the Disney Company has feverishly worked to this day to protect. The rest of the cast does not disappoint, and we even see Colin Farrell potentially impress some Academy voters as the loving yet extremely defective father figure.Disney's protection of its brand is the sole reason why Saving Mr. Banks could never ever ever ever ever ever be produced or made by anybody else. But luckily for all viewers, Disney doesn't pull back many punches in delivering the story behind the complex and conflicted making of Mary Poppins. It will be deep in the Golden Globes and the Academy Awards but ultimately indeed deserves the praise—even if you won't see all the details behind the true story on screen."
991,tt1014775,8,"My wife is a dog-lover (I am not). We raised pugs for many years and they are all gone to doggy heaven now. When I saw a film preview that included a pug, I just had to get my wife to this movie. (She will rarely go to a movie - many are just plain bad). We had a GREAT time. It is a comedy, so let's not worry about the misplaced geography which I did not notice until reading some of the negative views here. I am a great admirer of the film-making art. The freight train episode is an amazing piece of film work. The attack of the mountain lions is quite convincing. Both of the latter we found quite convincing. Every pooch in this film deserves an Oscar as do the humans and the writers. This is a fine family movie, for both children and adults. Don't take it seriously. It is a comedy. It is an entertainment, and we just felt we needed something like this to get away from the depressing news - economic disaster in America, fires in California to the North and South of us. This film is just what the doctor ordered for an evening."
992,tt1014775,5,"Alright, so tons of people are bashing this movie even though they didn't see it. I thought it would be dumb too... until my friend practically dragged me to see it with her. It sounds like this movie would be about chihuahuas in Beverly Hills and their luxurious lives and basically a 'Clueless' with doggies instead. And it is, for the first 10 minutes or so.But then, it transitions into something completely different than where I thought it was going. I liked how it eventually talked about cultural identity and not forgetting where you're from, which was a good direction for the movie. With that, it was good how the human girl and the girl chihuahua both become less ignorant as the film progresses. And, come on, it was adorable how this was basically a chick flick with little doggies instead! It was pretty hilarious in some parts (George Lopez as Papi!) especially with some interesting song choices, lol. My only quibbles were the slight sappiness with the whole Disney has-to-have-a-moral dialogue and that Drew Barrymore's voice was annoying after a while as the lead chihuahua with her whining... Still, it was pretty great and it got the whole theater laughing at several points.It's nice to have a movie that doesn't take itself that seriously once in a while :] So basically, go see this before you condemn it to a rating worse than ""Gigli""'s!"
993,tt1014775,1,"Me, my husband and our two children ages 4 and 7 went to see this movie and we all had a great time! It kept everyone's attention for the entire length of the movie. It was hilarious, fast paced and heartwarming. I'm not sure why the movie got such bad ratings on here. I think people are being way too critical. The theater was full of couples without children, which was surprising to me, but it seemed like everyone enjoyed the movie and no one walked out!!! Before seeing the movie, I read the comments here and went into it with little expectations. I was happily surprised, enough so to take the time to register here at IMDb and state my opinion. 'Nough said!!"
994,tt1014775,6,"This movie has a lower rating than ""Superhero movie"". And that was absolutely crap. I am not a child and not a dog lover. Still i found myself liking this movie.And no I am not suffering from any mental illness or something like that. Honestly the nerve of people to say something like that. I wonder if most of the reviewers actually have seen the movie. If so what did these people expect from a movie like this. A talking Chihuahua reciting a poem from Shakespeare or just a cute dog mixed up in some little adventure. Compared to previous Disney movies about animals it is on the same level. So what if it isn't original. What movie is these days. This movie hasn't got one dull moment. I sat through the movie without ever looking at the clock. And I can tell you that a lot of the big titles that came out this year wished they had the same effect on me.Most of the box office titles made this year have disappointed me much more because I had high expectations. For ""Beverly Hills Chihuahua"" i had no expectations whatsoever and got rewarded with fun."
995,tt1014775,1,"I took my toddler to see this because he loves dogs, and I thought it would be a great chance or him to see his first film. I was not expecting to enjoy the film, but was truly amazed by how well done it was. Sure the dogs were cute & it definitely has appeal to children. But I found the messages (about finding your inner strength, being a good friend, not being stuck up, and about the importance of adopting stray animals & caring for those that are lost or abandoned) very well-executed, they were clear without bludgeoning the viewer on the head repeatedly as so many children's films do.I have to say the fact that the ""coyote"" who was meant to smuggle Chloe across the border was actually a Coyote, and the line about ""say hello to my little friends"" made me laugh long after I had left the theater.I plan to buy this film on DVD when it comes out & enjoy it with my family for years to come."
996,tt1014775,1,"Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey was probably one of the best animal movie around, and everything that that movie was, this movie isn't. It isn't spectacular, it isn't breathtaking, it isn't adventurous, it isn't funny, it just goes to show how low Disney will sink to earn money from your children. Take it from me, I'm only 15 years old, and even I was holding my forehead with my hand and shaking my head, wondering: ""Why??... WHY?!"" It might be good for preschoolers who laugh at stupid jokes, but my goodness, I'd be surprised if this even makes 2 stars on the official ratings list. To put it all together, I not only want my money back, but I am going to torch this ticket in my fireplace tonight and forget all about it. @_@"
997,tt1014775,8,"Upon seeing the rating on IMDb, I went into this movie thinking it was going to be terrible. However, it is a very entertaining film from start to finish...similar to the Benji movies from the 70s for those old enough to remember. Chloe, the main character, is a spoiled little chihuahua from Beverly Hills who ends up lost in Mexico and enlists the help of some canine friends in an effort to find her way home. She learns some good life lessons along the way. My kids and I were glued to the screen. Plenty of action, laughs, and occasional tears. Every child leaving the theater with us was singing the ""Chihuahua"" theme song and seemed to have loved it. I don't know what those who gave this a bad rating were expecting, but I give it a wholehearted thumbs up. 8/10"
1004,tt0397892,9,"I have been anticipating the release of Bolt for several months. I had an opportunity to see a screening of it and it exceeded all my expectations. Bolt is a wonderful movie with a good story and heart, something that Pixar has done well but Disney has struggled with. I believe the addition of John Lasseter to Disney Animation has made a significant impact on the quality and continuity of this film. Yes, it is CGI. You may ask, ""Why is Disney doing CGI when Pixar already does?"" All the studios are doing CGI right now. I have been very impressed with Pixar's CGI detail, however the detail in Bolt is even better. Creating a dog with fur that gets dirty, wet, wind-blown and looks real is very impressive (at least it is to me). In addition to better detail, the color and light of this film is so true to life, you'll think it's the real thing.I laughed, cried, and was on the edge of my seat. Disney has created some lovable characters who will definitely win the hearts of millions. Congrats to the entire Disney Animation studio, well done."
1005,tt0397892,1,"The 2000s have not been very kind to Walt Disney Animation. While there has been the occasional Emperor's New Groove or Lilo and Stitch, the majority of their films from this decade have been rather mediocre (most notably 2005's Chicken Little, which - ironically - remains the studio's highest-grossing film of the 2000s). With that said, I initially had some doubts about Bolt, despite hearing that it would be Disney Animation's first film supervised by Pixar founder John Lasseter. The surprisingly positive reviews posted shortly before the film's release convinced me to buy a ticket. Thankfully, I was forced to eat my words; welcome back, Disney.The film revolves around Bolt, a white German Shephered who has spent his entire life on the set of a TV show in which he portrays a ""superdog"". As a result, he believes that the events on film (and his super powers) are real. When he is accidentally shipped from his Hollywood soundstage to New York City, he embarks on a cross-country journey to reunite with his owner and co-star, Penny. Along the way, Bolt teams up with a jaded alley cat named Mittens and a TV-obsessed hamster named Rhino who also happens to be an extreme Bolt fanboy.First of all, the effects in this movie are unbelievable. Everything in the movie looks so realistic and yet doesn't contradict with the animated cartoon-esquire characters. Also, while Bolt is obviously the star of the movie, the real comedy comes from his unlikely companions. In fact, my favorite character of the bunch is Mittens the cat, voiced excellently by Susie Essman. Very seldom do I hear/see a character and say ""I can't imagine anybody doing a better job playing him/her"", but Essman really brings a lot to this already memorable character. And though I found him to be pretty irritating at first, some of the best lines in the movie come from Rhino the hamster.Lastly, in one of the opening scenes we see Bolt as he is in the TV Show to set the understanding of Bolt's world. Seriously, that was made of awesome. The scene was action packed and full of excitement. I would watch the show that Bolt is in. If I had to have a complaint, it would be that it takes some ideas from several other films (such as Homeward Bound, Toy Story, and The Truman Show). That said, it still manages to feel like its own film, and with grace.With terrific animation, an incredibly heartwarming story, and some of the most endearing characters I've ever seen on film (animated or otherwise), Bolt has not only become my favorite Disney film (Pixar included), but perhaps my absolute favorite movie of all time. It feels strange saying that, especially considering that I didn't even expect to like the film, but I simply can't think of a movie that I've loved more. It's also one of the very few films that manages to bring me to tears every time that I watch it, and when a movie is able to affect me on that kind of level, it automatically becomes a winner."
998,tt1198405,6,"Since 1906, boaters from all corners of the globe have gathered to compete in the Transpacific Yacht Race, a two-week-long sailing competition that extends across more than 2,000 miles of open ocean, starting in Los Angeles and ending in Honolulu. In 2007, Roy Disney and a team of expert trainers sponsored a hand-picked crew of young sailors - ages 18 to 23 - to compete in the event (indeed, it was the youngest team in the history of the race). Named after the 52-foot boat on which they sailed, ""Morning Light"" is a documentary account of both the preparation for that race and the race itself.The movie spends much of the first half focusing on the grueling training the youngsters underwent as part of the process of whittling down the group of 15 hopefuls to a final crew of just 11.Directed by Mark Monroe, ""Morning Light"" is a wholesome, upbeat, fast-paced documentary with razor-sharp editing (by Monroe and Paul Crowder) that really gets the adrenaline pumping, and cinematography (by Josef Nalevansky) that truly makes you feel like you're a part of the action. Through interviews, we get to know a little about the youngsters themselves, what motivates them, what excites them about sailing, and what it means to them personally to make - and, indeed in some cases, to not make - the final cut.With its inspirational, shoot-for-the-stars pop-rock soundtrack, MTV-style editing techniques and ""Real World"" communal setup (albeit a squeaky-clean one), the movie is clearly aimed at a younger audience. And there are times when the film does feel a little too ""Disneyfied"" for its own good (did none of these young adults ever once swear?). But folks of any age will be able to thrill to this film, provided they have a spirit of adventure - armchair variety or not."
999,tt1198405,1,"Morning Light came out in theaters at the end of 2008, only to meet sub-par reviews. The reviews seemed to have common themes critiquing the chosen sailors ethnicities, economic backgrounds, 'good looks', and the movie's lack of interpersonal conflicts that are to be expected in a cookie cutter reality-TV type movie. However, all of these statements seem to be based on the given persons mindset going into the movie. If you are looking for a show or movie with a range of personal backgrounds and a fair bit of drama, The Bad Girls Club or the vast majority of MTV shows currently airing would be a far superior choice to Morning Light. Morning Light is the documentary of 15 sailors, all between the ages of 18 and 22, as they train for, and embark on their first major ocean race. There has been some skepticism as to how the crew members were cast, but each and every one of those kids were chosen solely based upon their sailing ability in order for the kids to have the best, and safest, shot possible at completing, and doing well, in the transpac. A small bit was based upon who could act normal in front of a camera, but that was to avoid the interpersonal drama often associated with such movies. This is a very fun, very real look at ocean racing and although it can be enjoyed by all, people with a bit of past sailing knowledge are the ones who will really enjoy, and get the most out of, this movie."
1000,tt1198405,9,"This movie is not for everybody, clearly, as judging from the previous comment! Let's start out by first mentioning that this movie is a sailing movie first and fore most, and it is a documentary. Those of you looking for Real Worldesque drama look elsewhere. Those of you looking for a well made documentary that captures the essence of a sport, look no further than Morning Light.The movie tells the tale of a contest set up by the late Roy Disney. Disney is a life long sailor, and having devoted his life to the sport of sailing, as well as bringing sailing to the youth, he came up with a way to bring a rich mans sport to the future of the sport, young college sailors. Roy Disney's ambitious goal is played out beautifully throughout the movie, and with the Walt Disney $$$ backing it, they have successfully made one of the best looking documentary's ever. Really the camera work was fairly remarkable. Non-sailors will not be able to understand the total lack of space aboard a Transpac vessel, and the shots that those camera workers got were remarkable.The greatest testimony I can give for this movie was when we showed it at the Yacht Club that I work at. We had a rainy day and were running out of ideas to keep the children at bay, but had this movie unopened in the office. The kids were really taken by it, and they learned that all the skills they were honing on the water in smaller boats can be translated directly to the larger ocean vessels. While sailing has for the most part been left to the ""rich white men"" (as the previous commenter put it) the sport has understood that and has made an elaborate effort to bring sailing to everyone. As the director at the largest sailing school in the midwest, I must say that movies like this are exactly what the sport needs. With gas prices at record highs and only going up, why wouldn't sailing be a popular sport in the future? Hopefully documentary's like Morning Light will continue to be made even after Roy Disney's passing. Rest in Peace sir!"
1001,tt1198405,8,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It is a documentary movie about a group of young sailors who are brought together by a most benevolent and charitable Roy Disney, his beautiful and creative wife and their crack squad of sailing coaches. Ultimately, thirty elite sailors have to be pared down to the fourteen who will race the boat ""Morning Light"" in the difficult Transpac Ocean Race. The photography is gorgeous. The reasons the coaches give for choosing the lucky sailors who eventually take part in this challenging endeavour are as interesting as the hurdles which befell the young sailors along their journey such as safety, night sailing, mechanical repair and sheer endurance. This movie is a delight and is real life as opposed to a hokey drama. Well done!"
1002,tt0397892,1,"Its an animated movie about a dog. GIVEN, its a 'kids' movie. Unlike many animated movies, the dialog isn't full of innuendos or 'hidden' humor that only adults would 'get'. Its easily understood by kids, the animation is top-rate (as would be expected) and the characters are engaging and easy to enjoy. I admit that even though I love animation, I went to this sneak preview with a few misgivings. The trailers didn't look all that exciting, and I didn't expect to see anything I hadn't already seen. On one hand, I was right. The animation WAS very good, but nothing that hadn't been done before. But on the other hand I was pleasantly wrong. The formula works perfectly for Bolt. It was fun, didn't have any 'dull' spots, and while my theater was filled with a fairly consistent mix of children and young teens, and a relative smattering of adults, everyone seemed to enjoy it. Laughter was pretty consistent among the old and young, and at the end of the flick I heard something I rarely get to experience in theaters these days: applause. Granted, the adults were the ones applauding, and I joined in enthusiastically. The wife and I agree that this was one movie where we felt we got more than our dollars' worth. Thats a rare treat. Bolt did not disappoint on any level -and will find a spot in our library when the DVD eventually hits market. I fully expect this movie to do very well."
1003,tt0397892,8,"Standing out in the crowd is not always the easiest thing to accomplish for an animated film, but above what you may expect, against WALL∙E's heart, and Kung Fu Panda's slapstick hilarity, Disney's Bolt jumps forward as simply the most fun. What makes Bolt noteworthy as well as a success on its own terms is its ability to take an age-old message about being true to oneself and finding your inner hero, and mesh it with a unique storyline that ends up spawning what, at first glance at least, seems wholly unique. Coupled with the expectedly bright crisp animation and stellar voice work, makes Bolt better yet, and a sure contender for best animated film at this years Oscars. Bolt also reclaims the original song work of Disney past, conceived between its also star and teen sensation Miley Cirus and Jenny Lewis and both compilations are memorable and sweet. Bolt never dives for the heartstrings, but scores its emotional points through well developed characters and thoughtful situations. Bolt opens with a very entertaining action sequence in which Bolt (voiced to surprising effect by John Travolta) and his master Penny (Miley Cirus) are chased by well equipped super villains which plays out in the vein of The Incredibles. The genetically altered canine can leap helicopters in a single bound, melt evil with laser eyes and destroy villains at a whim with his super-bark. It is soon revealed that the action speckled lives of Penny and Bolt is in fact a hit television show, which requires Bolt to be kept in the dark about the nature of his existence; in brief, he actually believes he has super powers. But after a cliff-hanger ending of an episode in which Penny is taken, prompts Bolt to escape, determined to reclaim his friend and master. Embarking for the first time into the real world he haphazardly enlist the help of a very reluctant cat (Susie Essman) and a fan-boy err...fan- hamster named Rhino (Mark Walton) and along the way learns, and earns, the true stripes of a hero and that of friendship. If everything I mentioned above was not enough to make you see this film, I can also reveal that Bolt is an at times hilarious send-up of the movie industry and genre clichés. Propelled by the hilarious supporting voice work including Malcolm McDowell, Dietrich Bader and James Lipton the blend of comedy, drama, and flat out entertainment value is unmatched. Also worth an enthusiastic mention are the pigeons that show up throughout the course of Bolt's adventure. Not only (as with all) is the voicing perfect but the physical humour implored is gut-busting, with the feathery fools twitching their heads in a pigeon- esquire way during their meetings with Bolt to glorious results. If you have a chance, you obviously should see this film in 3-D, however it is still well worth your money viewed in a traditional medium. Bolt is a reminder of why Disney was such an animation juggernaut and it is pleasant to see them recapturing some of their past glory. And just in case you want it mentioned bluntly, yes there are many jokes that older patrons will more then enjoy. It is always refreshing to see an old formula revamped so effectively and certainly always welcome to see a movie that can put a smile on faces of all ages. 8.5 / 10.0View all my reviews at Simon Says Movie Reviews: www.simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com"
1006,tt0960731,7,"The thing about Bedtime Stories is that it is light, funny, easy to digest and all around great for the whole family.It's just like any other Sandler's movies except this one doesn't contain any only-for-adults jokes.It might not be the movie I'd recommend to someone who is in for something serious or something that is seriously funny, but this movie has got it all. There's comedy, slight drama and a lot of action; from cowboys to the outer space.Great writing and great acting.Really, there's nothing to complain. It's just a very entertaining family movie, which we don't get a lot these days.I recommend Bedtime Stories to any Disney fans and also to anyone who'd enjoy Adam Sandler's movies, minus the sexual and dirty jokes."
1007,tt0960731,8,"We went to this movie with my two kids (ages 7 and 10, both girls), my Brother-in-law and his wife and their two kids (ages six and nine, both boys.) We were a bit apprehensive about this due to the poor critics ratings on Rotten Tomatoes. (Frankly, the critics gave it abysmal ratings and I almost avoided this entirely because of those ratings.) And perhaps they were right. But I know that despite the critics we all enjoyed it greatly. Maybe it was just the mood we were all in or the good meal we just had before the movie but we laughed throughout. Obviously there is no high-brow humor here or social commentary to be made. It's just a movie who's sole purpose is simply to have fun. Cookie cutter? Perhaps. In fact, in retrospect I'm sure it was. But it was still enjoyable.So if your looking for something more than what you see in the previews, forget it. It isn't happening. This movie makes no pretenses about what it is exactly about: good fun. If your looking for anything other than that, you're going to be disappointed.On the down side, some of the best moments were captured in the previews. While this certainly isn't the first movie to this (not the last I'm sure), it always seems to take something away from the experience of watching the movie. But there were plenty of other twists and turns in this movie that helped minimize the effect this had on the overall viewing experience.Overall this movie was a delight for kids both big and small in our group. You'll enjoy it if you watch it with a child's eye...and not those big ones Bugsy has!!!"
1008,tt1229827,1,"Face it folks, the Jonas brothers are atrocious. For anyone comparing them to LEGENDARY bands, you're forgetting a few things.1. Legendary bands possess musical talent (i.e. they write their own music, have good voices, are skilled with instruments, etc)2. Produce honest to god good music, are innovative, beautifully arrange their music, etc.3. Are NOT whores of the Disney media machine. There's a reason they're plastered all over the Disney channel; it's because Disney is brainwashing their target audience (pre-pubescent girls) into thinking the music they make is good. IT ISN'T. It's rubbish...it's absolute rubbish. It actually manages to be more horrid than the trash boy-bands of the 90's put out. It flat out reeks of failure.I'm a movie reviewer for my college newspaper, and to be perfectly honest, the movie was the worst piece of poorly scripted, overly cliché crap I've ever had the displeasure of viewing. Aside from the concert (which wasn't ""incredible"" chiefly because of their awful stage presence and even worse music) EVERY LINE was hand fed to these idiots. It's as if they were not capable of any conversation past the remedial level. In addition to that, the theatre was LOADED with girls who SCREAMED every time they came on the screen, it felt like there were over 9000 of them in there! God almighty...get over yourselves. Screaming at a screen isn't going to get you anywhere with and Jonas FailuresWant to see a real documented concert experience for a great band? Pop in Depeche Mode 101; an epic band who pushed the bounds of music in the 80's, and even today, and it's documented by one of the best, D.A. Pennybaker. Or, if that's music isn't your thing, listen to: Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Queen, Fleetwood Mac, U2, NIN, basically, anything that has the 3 criteria listed above. Not this spoon fed drivel passed along as ""music"" (which it isn't, it really, truly is awful)"
1009,tt1229827,1,"In honest truth, whether this was for getting paychecks or just putting on a pretty outfit for the girls to see, Jonas Brothers: The 3-D Concert Experience was a film that should of never made it past movie critics. This is proof that the music industry is failing on the surface and is desperate to put any no-talent jockey on the music scene.Look, I'm not all for critics or casual onlookers, but there was no need to green light this crap. The Jonas Brothers can prove to us that we can make it big by putting on a pretty face, and getting your popularity based on your image. The sad truth is that they didn't have to work that hard to make it to the top, so they steal elements based on other music artists and they try to regurgitate them into something new. They do so with flying colors, that is, with failure. Their music sounds so horrible I can make better sounds on my computer. That's really not saying much. Their poor guitar play, horrible singing, and a stale drummer add up to the realization that they possess no talent. Certainly nothing that would make a music critic go crazy about.A sign of decline in this day and age is there are people dumb enough to compare the Jonas Brothers to great bands and artists of the past. Don't even try to compare them with Elvis Presley, the Beatles, the Ramones, AC/DC, Aerosmith or the other great music artists who helped make a difference in the music scene. They set the stage for what was to come and were music artists that were actually liked for their musical influence and talent. The Jonas Brothers, on the other hand, seem more fit to be a quick fad that will fade out by the year's end.The worst, and perhaps the most shocking aspect of the movie is Disney's involvement with the Jonas Brothers. Just seeing the Disney logo slapped on the front is enough to make any classic Disney fan cry in terror. Who is running this show? Why should Disney be involved in any of this? What is the purpose of putting on a terrible concert show in theaters? This is simply a message that Disney does not care anymore. Back in the day, Disney was something that every child and parent looked forward to. From Snow White to the Lion King, Disney entertained audiences for generations and set the bar for creating animated masterpieces and original shows. Walt Disney was a highly respectable man and was simply ahead of his time. Jonas Brothers: The 3-D Concert Experience has none of the magic or innovation of the old Disney. It is simply a title of greed and misconception.The Jonas Brothers need to leave our general conscious. If any idiot would stump so low to actually waste a hard day's paycheck to see this flying piece of crap, then that person should seek a mental hospital. The Jonas Brothers: The 3-D Concert Experience is nothing redeeming, nothing new, nothing special, and nothing exciting. I'm very upset that Disney was involved in any of it, and the fact that idiots out there don't realize how bad this is, makes me very frustrated. People out there need to seek talent that is higher than the average person. All this is is a publicity stunt that can show us that any moron can go crazy over a band that was stale from the beginning.This is why much of mainstream entertainment is failing to put out something of influence. Instead, they are promoting crap like Jonas Brothers: The 3-D Concert Experience in order to have the mind-controlled sheep buy more fluff. The people behind the box office should be ashamed of this title. Don't believe the hype, just ignore the title and hope that the Jonas Brothers won't come back for a sequel. Critics should know what passes for a movie, and this doesn't qualify.A title that holds nothing to the Disney name.One out of Ten."
1010,tt1229827,1,"This is simply trash. Garbage. This is lettuce rotting in a plastic bag under landfill mountain bad.I don't only hate this band. My hatred of branded morals is all-encompassing. I don't like children being exploited and this is clear exploitation of both the audience and the band.I am happy to see that while the band can maintain its bazillions of fans, this movie is failing hilariously. This movie should never have been made. STOP TRYING TO CAPITALIZE ON ONE SUCCESS BY OVER-SATURATING EVERY POSSIBLE VENUE WITH THIS KIND OF DIRT!-end of rant-"
1011,tt1229827,1,"Hot on the huge red heels of Hannah Montana/Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert, another joylessly choreographed gig from Disney's stable of pop stars; so squeaky-clean they probably leave their internal organs soaking in buckets of Persil overnight. Nick, Kevin and Joe are the kind of all-American, all-processed poppets comedian Bill Hicks would have torn into like a school of piranha were he still alive. That job fell to Russell Brand, who mocked their no-sex-before-marriage 'Purity Rings' at 2008's MTV Video Music Awards. Yet instead of being forced to apologise, Brand should have been paid off by Disney for raising the band's profile.For squillions of kids, however, the Little Christians That Could are already Olympus-sized. This becomes immediately apparent the moment we and our 3D glasses float, as if borne on angels' backs, into New York City's Madison Square Garden arena. Here, 20,000 screaming tweens waggle their glowsticks like unsullied pregnancy testers at the preening boy-men who emerge to bombastic strings and spurting sheets of flame. It's like Triumph Of The Will for under-12s. And everywhere you look, hydraulics. Hydraulic platforms to elevate the Brothers to the vertiginous level of ascetic monks, literally looking down on their fans; hydraulics to pucker their cyborg lips, offering the promise of a chaste, metallic-tasting kiss.At various junctures, songs occur; as substantial as farts in a wind tunnel. At one point a baby gazelle with perfect hair called Demi nearly blows them off stage with her superior number, before being chased away again. Jonas songs are accompanied by a fey, second-hand gesture from lead vocalist Joe, in which he clenches his thighs together and raises one knee, as if frantic for a pee. Stage-moves as old as pop, courting reactions older than pop, from hormonal girls expertly shaken up like soda bottles, until diverted at the pass to explode their passions into waiting cash registers.It is breathtaking in its contrivances and blatant in its borrowings. With an opening scene of three young men being chased by a swollen mob of rabid girls to a waiting helicopter, this mindlessly apes the beginning and closing moments of A Hard Day's Night. Director Richard Lester might have cherry picked from the greats - everything from Mack Sennett-style tomfoolery to stylized shots swiped from Fellini - but he did at least end up with something fresh and funny and new. This doesn't possess one-tenth of that film's warmth, naturalism or feral thrill. In his opener, Lester had expertly caught a sense of the Beatles as prisoners of their success; it's clear those girls meant business, that if they were to catch up with the lads they would have literally ripped them apart like latter day Bacchae. This lot look like they'd just text their prey to death.Where there are stars, there are satellites. Here are three jokers in wigs and waistcoats posing with the multitudes outside the concert hall, engaged in what the Americans call ""goofing around."" These are the 'imitation' Jonas Brothers, buzzards pecking at the crumbs of celebrity. Robe-stroking lepers. If ""the Jonas Brothers are living the dream, we're dreaming the life"" they say. Trouble is, they actually appear to have more charisma than the real things who, on this admittedly scant evidence, lack strong, or even vaguely likable personalities of their own.This personality vacuum is a real problem in a film that purports to depict a day in the life of young pop stars audiences can actually relate to. Straitjacketed into their roles (back-flipping; power-sliding; looking cute), and unable or unwilling to offer any organic or even semi-improvised conversation, the Jonas trio are obliged to traipse through shamelessly staged scenes of purported verite, such as belatedly catching the cameras 'accidentally' filming them taking their tops off backstage. Bad camera! This occasionally backfires, as in an early sequence where the breakfasting Brothers arrogantly shoo away their Trump Hotel waitress, who happens to be hovering in shot, either star-struck or, more likely, patiently waiting for another order. It wrong-foots, as do the 3D effects, which mainly consist of Joe hurling guitar picks or his sunglasses straight at us. How would you like to have a pair of sunglasses flung in your face? Watching this feels like working for Naomi Campbell.At time of writing, this has achieved 1.3 out of 10 on the IMDb, the site's lowest ever score - for a documentary at least (it doesn't count this as a feature film). Yet this intensely polarizing movie has clearly been subject to some tactical voting, given the overwhelming majority of glowing, hysterical reviews. Meanwhile, the site suggests that ""If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends Gimme Shelter"". A slightly reckless juxtaposition, given that the film, which documents the Rolling Stones' tragic 1969 Altamont Free Concert, culminates in the on-screen murder of an audience member by the Hells Angels. The only thing being murdered in Jonas Brothers: The 3D Concert Experience is music.Well, alright. It's fairly safe to assume this reviewer is not the intended demographic for this movie. And couldn't be any less suited were they also blind in one eye, and thus unable to get anything out of the 3D experience. Not to belabor the point, but in the Jonas Brothers management boardroom there's a flip chart sporting this reviewer's photo and the word 'No' underlined three times in thick black marker pen. This will probably more than satisfy the audience it's aimed at. But for the rest of us, a tour called 'Burning Up' suggests only one thing. We are in Hell."
1012,tt1229827,1,"How Can People Listen to this stuff. It is just plain torture. These people are not a band they just want attention and money. They have no respect for the art of music. These idiots do not compare with any good rock band of the past. AC/DC, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Metallica...Those are real bands not this manufactured garbage. It is just terrible that music has sunken this low. And the fact that this useless movie exist is just a disgrace. Disney REALLY needs to start trying before they lose all their credibility. DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE OR LISTEN TO THIS BAND IF YOU DO YOU ARE PART OF THE PROBLEM NOT THE SOLUTION BRING GOOD MUSIC BACK!"
1013,tt1229827,1,"The first time I saw Jonas Bros was in the movie ""Rock Camp"" or something like this (by accident). I admit this was the lethal and final hit!!!!! Now I know why young people do drugs.I know I am rough on this but please DO NOT TORTURE PEOPLE LIKE THIS.I did also grew up listening the good and the bad music of my time (80's - 90's) but man, this must be stopped. It is beyond everyone can imagine.Thank you for assuring that people can always go lower and you are helping more to do this. I hope that this will be stopped also.Anyway, that is enough for me too. Really, before starting to write this comment, I thought about it very much, but I cannot sit watching pathetic Disney people giving 10 stars just to raise the bar.Kids, please PLEASE, ask someone older that can actually tell you what is good and bad. No, not please, I am BEGGING you to get out of the mass and try something different like reading and writing and drawing. I can assure you that this will be the best things that you have ever done. And when a good movie comes out you will see that you will have a much nicer time watching it than ever before."
1014,tt1229827,1,"Dear god, this is a disgrace. I'm baffled as to why anyone would like to see this. They are untalented, fugly boys who STILL haven't hit puberty, even though I'm pretty sure they are at least 15. If you want to see a movie that has talented actors, a good script, as well as excellent musical performances, why not see ""U2 3D"", or the best ever, ""A Hard Day's Night"", by the Beatles. They showcase excellence bands that can actually play music. I am convinced that the Jonas Brothers are sent here from Hell by Satan himself. I miss the days where musicians played music, not manufactured Disney crap that is meant only to sell sell sell.btw- love that the movie is exactly where it belongs, it is officially the WORST movie of all time."
1046,tt0436339,3,"As a parent of two children, ages 6 and 8, my family sees a lot of movies and has been highly anticipating G-Force after all the hype that was placed on it. What a disappointment!! The funny parts that are shown on the trailers are not funny in the movie. There's a couple of scenes that might merit a chuckle; the use of the word ""couple"" is pushing it. Even my kids said that they were very disappointed because it was more of an action movie. Basically, all the decent parts were in the trailers. I usually don't dislike a movie this much, but I disliked this one enough to register here and make a comment about it since I use the reviews a lot myself. I'm really feeling jipped right now over this movie."
1015,tt1229827,1,"No, no no no no, the assumption that we cheered on N'Suck or the Bareback Boys is, to be quite honest, as wrong as is the belief that the Jonas Brothers produce something besides trash music. When the afore mentioned bands, and their contemporaries were popular, I was listening to Pink Floyd, Radiohead, Hendrix, NIN, and I knew many people in my age group (those who these so called bands targeted) with similar good taste in music. Face it, they are a rotten band, and if you think Nick playing a guitar in one video elevates their status from landfill worthy to anything else, as you rightly pointed out, it was only one video he played in. As for them not wanting to be in the publics eyeI won't even dignify that with a retort, as the only way you could possibly think that is if ones I.Q. is equal to the number of days in a week, or if one is simply so infatuated with them, no amount of reason could sway your beliefs.They are media whores, and their sole purpose (even if they think they are hot stuff, and a new wave in musicLOL) is to make cash. As soon as the public shows signs of disinterest, Disney will too, and the Jonas Brothers will disappear, maybe only to be remembered in a Distant VH1 special documenting their short claim to fame, built on the backs of pre-teen girls."
1016,tt1229827,1,"I swear, their fanbase is pathetic. Heaven forbid we should ever say anything bad about the Jonas Brothers. It's just like running over their dog or something. Shut up, already. They are horrible ""musicians"" and I use that term loosely. It's laughable that you think we are jealous of them. What do we have to be jealous of? Last time I checked, I have no desire to write crappy songs and target pre-teen girls. At my age, that would get me arrested. You all say we have no life, yet you're doing exactly the same thing we are so I guess that means you don't have lives either. I'm sorry you all have closed-minds towards real music but that's not our problem. You can all give in to their shameless pandering all you want. Every time I see a Jonas fan spouting off whiny little rants, it makes me even more glad I'm not part of that fanbase. I listen to bands with way more talent than them like AC/DC, The Beatles, Metallica, R.E.M., etc. Who cares if we haven't seen the stupid movie? The point is, we don't NEED TO see it. We KNOW what this lame movie is about: the Jonas Brothers in concert. Lah-de-freakin'-dah. Like seeing the movie is going to change our opinion of them? It won't. I would think you'd be smart enough to realize that. To the person who wished death on Jonas haters, real classy. I hope karma comes around to bite you on that one. We hate the Jonas Brothers and seeing their stupid 3D movie isn't going to change it. Now go back to kissing your Jonas posters and daydreaming about being their wives."
1017,tt1229827,1,"I am a mother of two and I brought my two children to see the movie and it was outright the worst movie ever. My children walked out! And I had to persuade them to stay because I paid $10 for 3 tickets and I didn't want to lose my worth so I stayed through the movie. To my horror, it was as bad as my children thought it was. I almost projectile vomitted on others. DO NOT WATCH THIS. If I could less than 1, I would have. WORST MOVIE HANDS DOWN. If you have to watch a GOOD movie, I would suggest the Hannah Montana movie that will be coming out soon. Save your money, save your breakfast, SAVE YOURSELF. It's time to watch Jonas Brothers - where's your kids?"
1018,tt1075417,7,"If aliens exist, and if they have access to the films made from Earth, they would likely make a mental note to remind themselves that should they visit our planet on terms other than a hostile takeover or annihilation, to avoid landing in the USA at all costs. Hollywood has enough dough to continuously churn out effects laden science-fiction movies, and most of them are big budgeted action fests like Independence Day and Men In Black, which don't exactly paint a good picture of the extra-terrestrials. Aliens who have more benign intent, would be frightened by how trigger happy and violence prone the US is toward illegal aliens, even if popular culture meant the landing zone for extra terrestrials is the USA and not other larger countries.Race to Witch Mountain being Disney fare means the toning down of practically everything to ensure that it is safe for the entire family to experience together. Dwayne Johnson seems right at home in family friendly flicks like The Game Plan (also directed by Andy Fickman), and I guess his action days on screen will be few and far between, especially when he gets to flaunt his dramatic and comedic flair. Woe is the fan boy like me who have grown up with The Rock, but there's no more people's eyebrow, and we should start to get used to seeing our idol in a different light on celluloid.Johnson plays a Las Vegas cab driver Jack Bruno who has a colourful past that he tries to bury, in order to earn an honest living to buy his dream Mustang featured in the Steve McQueen movie Bullit. In a confluence of the stars he picks up a scientist who specializes in extra terrestrials, before chancing onto two of them when they boarded his cab without his knowledge. The brother and ssister aliens  Sara (AnnaSophia Robb) and Seth (Alenxander Ludwig)  are here on a noble mission, and are in hot pursuit by the shady government agents led by Henry Burke (Ciaran Hinds) as well as something like a Terminator from many light years away.This naturally gives rise to your standard set action sequences where we get to see the alien twins exercise their rather innocent demeanour (""they're only kids!"") to their advantage, behind which hides the immense powers they possess such as Telepathy and Density manipulation, which I thought was a very cool power to have. Imagine being able to pass through walls, yet having tremendous strength in the form of a road block, literally. AnnaSophia Robb whom I felt did a fantastic job in The Bridge to Terabithia, stars as the female child, and because of her character's ability, she brings forth a more trusting, and empathetic character, in direct contrast to the other alien Seth (The Seeker from The Dark is Rising is all grown up now), who's more direct, commanding, aloof and untrusting of humans in general, no doubt their initial experience was in having their space ship confiscated to Witch Mountain, and being chased for the conduct of experiments.Carla Gugino, last seen as the aged Silk Spectre in Watchmen, got active only in the last third of the show, which was somewhat of a pity because she shared great chemistry with the rest of the cast, and got involved quite late into the thick of things. But of course if there's any consolation, like how the bits during the end credits would suggest, and depending on the box office results, there might be room for more in a sequel, if it comes. There are references galore in the film given that there's a science-fiction convention event featured in the movie, and you can't help but also think about the potential for theme park rides with the yellow cab being pursued and pretty banged up. In fact I was wondering each time the cab got put through an action sequence, that it would make for a great 4D ride in Disneyland. You can't help it because it was quite in your face, with the sequences designed in that manner, deliberately or otherwise.Despite some glaring plot loopholes, Race to Witch Mountain has all the ingredients for a great family outing. The story doesn't try to be more intellectual than it can handle, and doesn't let the special effects run wild and take over everything else. For being such a sentimental fool, the ending also got some brownie points from me, as it's tough not to shed a tear or two given the trials and tribulations from which a solid bond is formed amongst all the characters. Recommended for a family outing, but don't go expecting something out of this world (pun not intended), as everything's pretty formula."
1019,tt1075417,7,"This is and is not a remake of the original Witch Mountain movie. It's more follows the guidelines and then takes off on its own in a more modern twist. If you liked the old one, you will probably still like this one too.The actors did a pretty good job all the way around. The main bad secret agent guy was a really flat character, while everyone else was more dynamic. Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson was great in this movie. He really keeps it going for the audience and is really funny. The kids are good as well. All the others did an alright job.The plot has good twists to it and has multiple sides that are all crashing in together at the same time. The flow of the movie is a little jerky in a couple spots, but overall is an action packed ride.The CGI effects are well done and believable. I enjoyed getting to see that aspect come to life, where the original Witch Mountain could only dream of seeing such cool stuff! Overall it is a good movie. Your kids will really like it and you will enjoy it as well. I recommend going and seeing it to anybody!"
1020,tt1075417,7,"Hey, don't believe the downers trashing this movie. It's fun. Non-action stop from beginning to the end. Dwayne Johnson, who finally shed his former wrestling nom de lutre, is a much better actor than people are willing to concede. He has a mobile face and uses his big body well with a lot more expression and ability than some of the other shoot'em up and knock-about action heroes. This film, a remake of the old Disney classics with a CGI uptake and story rewrite, is entertaining, engaging and full of witty little pieces for the watchful viewer. When the alien bad guy gets knocked for a loop and everyone ducks for cover and the 2 UFO-Trekkie-types rejoice, (Wow. Best convention ever!) and the one I liked best, one of the nerd bad guys named Analyst D. Pleasance, for the veteran character actor, Don Pleasance who played the bad guy in the Disney originals. Also, Irish actor, Ciaran Hinds makes a superb Man in Black Suit bureaucrat villain and lovable Cheech Marin as the sleepy mechanic gets his licks in too, albeit in a bit part. The beautiful Carla Gugino comes across as the UFO seeking academic and Director Garry Marshall as the nut case UFOligist makes for good comic relief. The two kids add the mixture with AnnaSophia Robb reminding me of one of my granddaughters and Alexander Ludwigs serious facial expression adding to the fun. I found this film fun from the get-go and recommend it highly."
1021,tt1075417,9,"I don't see why some people say that they don't like this movie. I thought it was a very good family oriented movie. It had a great blend of comedy and action and I found it very refreshing.I love the Rock and I think he does very well in these types of movies. I love the old Witch Mountain movies and wasn't sure at first about this one but it was different enough to be well liked by those who have watched the old ones and enough action to get the younger crowd. I also love Ciran Hinds and even though he was playing the bad guy in this movie it was nice to see him in a role that had him in most of the movie instead of bit parts, he is a great actor and I hope he gets some larger roles in the future.Over all a nice family movie."
1022,tt1075417,7,"First of all, it's not great. Second, any of the reviewers who talk about the original being a classic, I was 11 in 1975. Give me a break. It was typical of the Disney crap released at this time. Finally, when I say close to great, I mean in an ET/Iron Giant way. Instead, it's more along the lines of Cocoon.This is a good movie, and at times, it IS great. But as a whole, it falls short. Much of the film is typical. You know, Aliens are good, men in black are bad, action, chase, environment message, yada yada. Here's where it's better than your typical sci-fi action family film.1. Everyone except Carla Gugino (Dr. Alex Freidman) is excellent in their rolls. Even she isn't particularly bad, just not as good. There are some good cameos. Gary Marshall is great. 2. The action: while this is PG, it doesn't shy away from violence or guns. But the catch is when Dwayne Johnson and the teen-Aliens are running from an Alien Bounty hunter early on, the teens look scared. Anna Sophia Robb's eyes really deliver a sense of vulnerability. I found this as effective as the Train Tunnel chase.3. It is rather dark for a PG film. The men in black are a culvert group from our federal government, who point their loaded weapons constantly at innocent US citizens. The film briefly makes the parallel to the Alien Bounty Hunter, who is a military agent from the teen- aliens' planet. Washington is mentioned behind the men in black. They want to kill our beloved Alien teens.4. As with most great Sci-Fi, it relates to our times. Our protagonist teens have no rights because they are illegal aliens. The Men In Black are out of control. Granted, this would work better if Bush was still president, but still, it directly plays on the reality that the executive branch of our government has unchecked power.5. Two sections of the movie takes place around a sci-fi convention. This allows for plenty of gags that remind us that the film makers didn't take this movie too seriously.Now, if this isn't your kind of film, don't be tempted to see it. But for family action, yes. For Sci Fi, it's a must see. For a Sci fi action flick, it does everything well, except the ending. And that's its fault. It is the typical corn ball alien ending (al-la Cocoon, or Splash). After the first two acts being so strong, it's too bad.Let's compare this to Bolt, since both are PG family Disney fare. After a poor second act, Bolt delivered with a rather emotion resolution. With Race to Witch Mountain, Act 3 becomes a Ron Howard formula. Strange, as Act 1 and Act 2 were almost good enough to be a must see for everyone.How could this film have delivered better in the end? First of all, play up the teen-aliens sacrificing themselves to save our world. Environment, so it reminds us of ""This Island Earth"". And Sarah dies making this sacrifice. Now, Seth and Jack stay strong until the end, when they finally let loose with the tears. Sarah's innocence was very effective in this movie, and this would be just emotionally devastating. But in the sequel we discover that Sarah's body has been reproduced, and her soul was stored in Jack Bruno's brain (think Star Trek 2 and 3). So he has a sudden fetish for female teen accents and a strange fascination with Hannah Montana. Would you pay to see Dwane Johnson air singing with a Hannah Montana wig, earrings, and a bow in his hair? I think so. So, Disney may have missed the boat on this. Big timeSo close."
1023,tt1075417,4,"Dwayne Johnson plays Jack Bruno, Las Vegas cabbie, and Carla Gugino is Dr. Alex Friedman, UFO expert. Perhaps you saw the preview in which Bruno and Friedman are crawling thru a tubular tunnel and she admits to a bit of claustrophobia. Just then Bruno reaches an opening into a deep vertical shaft and asks ""How are you with heights?"". It was a good scene, with a bit of low-key but contextually appropriate humor that the former Rock has learned to deliver effectively, making him a big, strapping brute of a guy that you feel comfortable with. But that scene isn't in the film itself. Instead, we see the aftermath, in which Friedman is still a bit freaked out, for no apparent reason.The rest of the movie was like that, too. People seemed to be doing things with no credible motives. The 2 adults flee from no fewer than 4 sets of pursuers exhibiting varying degrees of hostility (The Government, a space-alien cross between Predator and Inspector Javert, Bruno's former mob boss Mr. Wolf and his henchthugs, and the LVPD). They do so to protect 2 teenage Swedish, I mean space, aliens who are here to retrieve the mcguffin, um, recording device that will prevent their planet from launching a hostile takeover, uh, invasion. The gal of the pair, Sara, is played by AnnaSophia Robb. We know from her performance in Bridge to Terabithia (2007, 9*) that she can be a tremendously appealing young actress, but here she gets to do stuff like pointing her finger and monotonically saying ""Go that way, Jack Bruno."". The boy, Seth, is played by Alexander Ludwig, a cipher.The government's head alien tracker warns Bruno that the kids are not what they seem to be. Anyone who's ever seen a science-fiction movie (which apparently includes precisely zero of any characters who are actually IN an SF movie) can only begin to imagine what might lurk beneath those placid blond exteriors, but this proves singularly untroubling for Bruno, leading right up to the snuggle-bunny ending (Disney, y'know), which was likewise not well set up by any of the preceding events.The scenes set at a UFO convention make good sport of fannish stereotypes, which some people might find offensive but I choose to treat as endearing. And I loved the sly humor that they DID leave in the script, wherein Bruno asks the kids at the controls of the flying saucer ""Do you know how to fly this thing?"", they respond ""How do you think we got here?"", and he replies ""Well, you crashed!"". More of that, from another couple of passes thru the typer, would have earned this one an upgrade.*Best SF&F film of the 21st Century so far, IMHO"
1047,tt0436339,1,"I thought this film was great,i don't understand why it didn't get a higher score.The storyline was fast paced, the animation and effects superb and the guinea pigs were generally funny.I thought the cast really made the characters come alive,I would definitely recommend this for families and children,the people giving it a bad review are not those whom it was made for. It is simply just a fun action film for kids, its's not trying to be a tarentino masterpiece, Disney did a great job on making another great flick for the family! The play-station game is great too!!"
1048,tt0436339,6,"G-Force, the family adventure by producer Jerry Bruckheimer (Pirates of the Caribbean), isn't a bad movie by any count and works as a fun kids movie. But a tired and formulaic plot means the movie is no 'must-watch' by any means and caters mostly to the little ones. The story follows a specially trained team of secret agent guinea pigs that work for the US government. Their mission is to stop an evil billionaire (Bill Nighty) who manufactures home appliances from taking over the world through a microchip he has planted in them.To begin with the positives, the animation is top-notch. The guinea pigs look very photo-realistic and after a few minutes you forget they're CGI. There is an inherent cuteness factor to them, and just like last year's Alvin and the Chipmunks, the filmmakers know that this will be the biggest draw for kids and their parents. There are plenty of jokes to keep a smile on your face (although the toilet humor gets old after a while).But that brings me to the story. How many times have you heard this: ""Evil genius wants to take over the world and only the unlikeliest of heroes can save the world.""? Too many to count, I imagine. And G-Force fits right into that category. The plot is tired and doesn't attempt to bring anything new to the table. There are subplots strangely similar to last year's Bolt, and the finale has an uncanny resemblance to Transformers. Aside from being predictable from the very start, the biggest problem here comes out in the final reels – the villain's motivations are laughably ridiculous. As if it wasn't hard enough to stomach the improbability in an evil billionaire's plan to take over the world by installing timed microchips in every home appliance he manufactures, the final act tries to implement a twist so ridiculous and far-fetched that one wonders what was going on in their mind when coming up with it. Sure, kids will chew it up, but adults are sure to gasp at the screen at the stupidity of it all. Still, lessons are learned and there's a bit of emotional quotient towards the end that makes partially saves it.Another problem is the action scenes. There are too many of them, and most of them are uninvolving. The movie opens with a 10 minute long covert operation that gets tiring a quarter of the way through. And every other ten minutes or so comes another chase or mission that only serves as eye-candy and gets monotonous and unfocused, especially in the finale. The special effects are great, but what's the need for exploding cars and buildings in a kid's movie?The voice acting is impressive. Sam Rockwell, Penelope Cruz, and Nicolas Cage do a great job bringing their characters to life. Bill Nighty plays a stock villain with no character development or motivation, and it comes across badly. Zach Galifianakis impresses as the leader of the team, but Will Arnett is wasted in a small and too serious of a role for a comedian of his caliber.So is G-Force recommended? Mostly if you have kids or are between 3-13 years old. It's not a bad movie by a stretch (it's much better than last year's Beverly Hill Chihuahua) and you will not get bored in the theaters, but it's a shame that the movie could have been so much more. They had an interesting bunch of characters on screen, but unfortunately they settled on making cookie-cutter Hollywood fare than something truly unique.Rating – 2.5 out of 5 stars."
1049,tt0436339,6,"G-Force is a specially trained team of guinea pigs, a mole and a fly. They must foil the plans of Saber, a millionaire, who wants to take over the world with these home appliances that ultimately transform into Megatron. Or something along those lines.I watched this one because it was available in 3-D. My first Disney Digital 3-d film. From the aspect, the kids will enjoy the things that pop out at you. This film has a few of those moments, water, debris and glass. Although it just didn't do it for me. The 3-D in this film didn't enhance the film or astonish me. Thus, it ultimately feels like a gimmick and will until a certain film that is planned to be released in the near future apparently plans to change that. I'm not saying it wasn't well done, I just expected more.The film is mixed animation and live action. The animation is obviously the rodents and insects, while the cast is formed of Hangover star Zach Galifianakis, Will Arnett and Bill Nighy. Galifianakis is really timid here and Nighy does his whole British thing, while Arnett plays the G-Rated version of an A-hole. Nothing memorable, and the kids won't care about these people. They want to see the funny guinea pigs do funny things. Yet, in the theatre I was in, which was full of kids, had hardly any laughs. That's not to say they won't enjoy themselves, because the film is entertaining. It's just not that great a comedy.The voice acting is great, Sam Rockwell plays Darwin, the lead commando. Tracy Morgan is Blaster, if anyone has seen him on 30 Rock, it's the same here. Penelope Cruz is the female character, who toys with the boys on which one she likes. Nicolas Cage plays Speckles, the mole who is a tech whiz. In this film if you did not know it was Cage playing this character, you would never know it was him. The voice is so different that is makes you scratch your head, well done on all parts.The child favourite without a doubt is Hurley, the guinea pig that our team meets in a pet shop. He has a bad case of flatulence and is the 'dumb' friendly character. He gets the most laughs, which like I said, wasn't many. Finally Steve Buscemi has a small role as a hamster and he plays it exactly as you would picture Buscemi to play it. The voice work from everyone was top notch, but if I were to hand it to anyone, it wold be cage for his transformation to the unknown.The animation is well done, the final action sequence does feel like it comes straight out of transformers, but it looks neat. The interaction between human and creature is still noticeably fake, even after all these years they can't seem to perfect this. Since this is a Bruckheimer film, you know there has to be non-stop action. This involves car chases left right and centre, covert-operations and battles with giant creatures. The film is fuel injected to the bone with this. There are moments here and there to slow everything down, yet they are extremely short and don't seem to do much to create conflict for the characters. When the guinea pigs are told they aren't special, they get doubt themselves, this lasts all but one scene because in the next they get a pep talk and are back to the chase sequences.The plot is one that we've all seen before. Unlikely heroes stopping someone from world domination. So don't expect anything new in the story department. The reveal at the end is lame and predictable, the whole bad guy plan is extremely far fetched and doesn't make sense. Although if you're expecting this film to make sense I guess you're in the wrong theatre. These are talking guinea pigs after all.The film is entertaining and the kids will most likely enjoy it. It does seem like a typical Hollywood kid flick and it is exactly that. There's no life lessons learned and by the end of the film your kid will want a new pet."
1024,tt1075417,1,"I'm glad I saw this movie before reading any of the other Comments here on IMDb! As a 63 yr old man, I see at least 4 good movies per week, and a few bad ones.I was drawn to this movie by AnnaSophia Robb, and hope to continue to see everything she does. As one who fell in love with her in ""Bridge to Terabithia"", and thrilled with her acting but not so much her bratty Character in ""Sleepwalking"", I wanted to see her alive and well and thriving. Hey, in this movie she is all that and more, she even has adorable Superpowers! (I went to theater to see her in ""Jumper"" but she's only in the first few minutes.) This is the first movie I've seen with Alexander Ludwig, playing Brother, Seth to AnnaSophia's Sara. He was brilliant in the part, and I hope to see him again, with or without his superpowers.It was a pleasant surprise to see, even if in a minor role for Chris Marquette as Pope. Chris played Adam in the ""Joan of Arcadia"" TV Series. He played slightly flawed but ever lovable character, and not that different here as a Government Rookie. I'm always pleased to follow any of the cast from that show.I was not drawn to see Dwayne Johnson, but as Jack Bruno, he brings a strong balance to the young players. Garry Marshall, Carla Gugino, and others bring a wealth of credits to the table and are a credit to their parts. And Why is Cheech Marin as the Reluctant Mechanic Uncredited? I have to mention the amusing and entertaining irony of having our real Space Aliens at a UFO Convention full of crazy looking caricatures of other favorite Sci-Fi Movies and UFO Psychos! I didn't care if this was a remake, or copies of other characters, or whether the special effects were perfect or believable. After a steady diet of heavy Academy Award nominated movies for the last 6 weeks, I gave this movie a 10 for pure absorbing entertainment and a fabulous showcase for the developing young talent."
1025,tt1075417,1,"Despite a good amount of bad reviews, people are flocking to see this film! I wonder if it's the picky old men that don't find a kids film decent enough for a proper work that disappoint me. I mean, who worse to judge a kid's movie than an adult? At least a teenager has still got the perspective of a child...The film really brought me back to good times at the theaters. I wasn't around for the original so, I can't compare the two, and went in not knowing what to expect.Initially, you could go in and see all the things structurally or aesthetically incorrect and unpleasing about the story film-wise. However, if you take the movie for what it is, you'll see that it's truly the beautifully crafted action-adventure every kid longs to experience and captured within the mysticism and excitement of a good space story using just enough cgi to compliment the film, without overpowering it's actors as so many movies do today. It promises a simple story with inspiring ideals and experiences woven into its heart.So, I couldn't help but put myself in the story for this one, and became completely immersed in the race. The great plot, unique characters, and pulse-racing adventure will keep you at the edge of your seat until the end!"
1026,tt1075417,5,"I liked the idea, that this is not a remake of the Disney classic Escape to Witch Mountain(1975), it's more of a rebooted version. Some remakes try to be carbon copies of the original, like Pyscho(1998), and The Bad News Bears(2005). This films premise is sort of the same but others ways different.The story begins in Las Vegas, where Jack Bruno(Dwayne Johnson) is a cab driver, and is really not a people person. But one day things change, when two siblings named Seth(Alexander Ludwig) and Sara(Annasophia Robb) enter his cab ask him to drive to a certain location, and they give him large sums of money. Jack is hesitant, but does it anyway. But then things are not so simply, when the government starts chasing them. Turns out these kids are aliens with special powers, that need to get to a certain location called Witch Mountain in hopes to prevent an alien invasion that could destroy earth. And a famed scientist(Carla Gugino) comes along for the ride.Now the moments between Dwayne and the kids are memorable. But the rest of the film kind of falls on itself. The action and effects where alright but nothing you'd call spectacular. Carla Gugino I felt by watching that she was written in at the last minute,cause they wanted a beautiful actress for Dwayne play off of, but Dwayne and Carla have no chemistry. And she does not look like she is having any fun doing this, she is just in it to cash a paycheck. And so was the rest of the cast, besides Dwayne and the kids. I didn't know when too laugh at times, I mean there times it was funny, other I couldn't tell at times if they where trying to be funny or serious for some scenes."
1027,tt1114677,1,"This movie shaped a generation. You don't know the feeling of serenity until you see Hannah Montana fight with Tyra banks over a pair of black and white striped heels. Or when the rascal flatts are having a casual porch jam session with a bunch of country bumpkins. This blockbuster has emotion, heart, soul, and a little bit of rock and roll. You'll laugh, cry, and most importantly get wet from Travis Brody."
1028,tt1114677,8,"I hope anyone who is the parent or is a relative of young girls will overlook the negative review comments from what appear to be adult men. I saw the movie today with my sister and her 8-year-old granddaughter. We all loved it and we laughed a lot. Anyone who has a young girl, fathers too, I think will enjoy this film. It's not going to win an Oscar for acting but it sure gets my vote for light entertainment. I liked the music from both Miley Cyrus and Taylor Swift; they have different styles.I'm am puzzled at the number of men who are reviewing a movie that is designed for little girls. I selected a couple of the reviewers who gave the movie one star and looked up some of their other reviews. I one case, his favorite movie contained a lot of violence and bloodshed.At any rate, I give it an eight because it successfully did what it set out to do. That is to let a lot of little girls and their loved ones have a good time."
1029,tt1114677,6,"I just wanted to comment on how completely ridiculous it is that grown people and older teenagers are commenting on how stupid, obnoxious, childish, un-funny, etc this movie was. I am a mother of 5 children, ages 12 to 2. My 3 daughters are 11 and two 9 year olds. They LOVED this movie and laughed their little butts off the whole time. Granted, there were MANY parts of the movie where I was bored to tears and I actually played a few games on my iPod touch I'd brought along...but AGAIN, this movie wasn't made FOR ME. IT WAS MADE FOR SMALL CHILDREN. And it really wasn't THAT bad. I mean, come on. We've all been watching Disney movies forever now, haven't we? Like you can't figure out who will die, who will win, who will lose, who will kiss whom, etc...in ANY Disney movie. Also, so she can't act?? Who cares? Because ALL of the Disney actors these days can't act. They are wooden and pathetic. BUT THE CHILDREN LIKE THEM. Stop being so judgmental about a movie that was geared towards 7 to 10 year old little girls, OK? It's just silly."
1030,tt1114677,5,"With my laptop with me, my sister and me decided to watch THE HANNAH MONTANA MOVIE on you tube last night. Let me say I read a couple of reviews about this movie saying how poor the movie is but since I am fan, I figured it was worth a watch.I'm not saying the film's bad because it isn't. I have seen all the episodes of HANNAH MONTANA and I thought they were pretty funny and cool. But I think most of the people who wrote bad comments just watched the movie instead of switching over to Disney Channel and figuring what HM was all about. So yeah.OK lets start off with the good side...1) I can say this film did a good job bringing all the episodes and questions together pulling a great conclusion.2) This film was like a whole new side for HANNAH MONTANA. Because you just skip Malibu, and the regular irritating ""audience laughs"" we see and hear in the HM episodes and go beyond the series, exploring Miley's main hometown, where you she actually came from and the choices she has to make.3) The songs were top-notch my favourite ones were Hoedown Throwdown and Lets Get Crazy I also liked some of the touching songs as well like Crazier by Taylor Swift (it was good to see her in the movie!) Butterfly Fly Away and The Climb and they also deliver an important message too.4) It kept a levelled balance of everything; from the laughs to the moments. Because normally in the HM series you always get more off the funny parts rather than the real moving parts.5) It was good work from Disney! NOW THE BAD...1) It was good but not great. I mean it wasn't something new from Disney like bringing it to a whole new level. It just kept it's sort of material that I normally expect from it. Although I said it was a whole new side, it was still nothing special.2) The performances were average, I'm not seeing any energy being delivered. The end was a big moment in the movie but Cyrus sort of ruined that with her acting, causing it to not work as ""dramatic"". Sorry :( ***SPOILERS AHEAD*** 3) When Miley rips off her wig, she said she can still be Hannah if everybody keeps the secret. Sure its her beloved hometown, but there's got to be one bad person who wants all the fame and money and blow her secret.4) Jackson's alligator incident was careless and pointless. That has got to be very serious damage! For a normal human being, you could have needed brutal surgery and... well, the film sort of took it as a practical joke!? 5) Does Miley try to reveal she's Hannah Montana? To Travis, to that reporter guy she always says, ""I saved Hannah Montana's life surfing and we're best friends!"" Stupid! Yeah - there's more bads than goods! 6) Now everybody knows shes ""best friends"" with Hannah Montana, why dosen't anyone use their brain? There's lot of evidence, her face, that voice, those dance moves? Yet nobody had the right mind to figure out she is ACTUALLY Hannah Montana! 7) Bad reporter turn into good reporter and not blow Miley's secret? No, no, no! In real life any normal reporter would just blow her secret! 8) There wasn't much shock when Hannah revealed shes Miley. Also I found the ending quite confusing, she just takes off her wig, sings and the end!?9) Unrealistic! 10) One more thing... sometimes Miley sings like she's got a cold or something and I'll admit she can't dance! Sorry for saying but true!I have a few more bad comments but I'll just leave it there for now...OK I'm not trying to say HANNAH MONTANA THE MOVIE is a bad film (like I said!) But I say it's probably a mixed bag (despite the few extra bad points I made) Although it was VERY close to four, I'd, at the very least, give it a 5. (Just because I'm nice :P) OK movie overall. Not bad I guess :)*****/********** stars (5/10 stars) ~Kalendra"
1031,tt1114677,1,"No, Really.The incredible lack of quality in this film is not only intensified by Miley Cyrus' lack of acting or singing skills, it is aggravated as the entire movie resolves around her own ""inner struggle""(huh). She is incapable of delivering her lines with any sort of credibility or patience whatsoever and has to rely on being loud and intense in order to keep people's attention. That showcasts how her on-screen persona is similar to her on-stage persona: In order to hide her obvious flaws in talent, simply distracting the fandom (teenage girls usually between 6 and 13) with over exaggerated moves and expressions tends to do the trick. Some people might call that ""Being relatable"" or ""Having a stage presence"", I call that a plot to remain in the spotlight of 10 year old girls (All while failing at ""overgrowing her character"" by dating a 21 year old underwear model and uploading half naked pictures of herself in real life).Billy Ray Cyrus, on the other hand, is the complete opposite of his daughter. Instead of overstating every single line and facial expression, he barely manages to pull them off with disdain. I swear to you, his repertory of expressions and emotions is even smaller than the list of his musical hits. The screenplay is just what one would expect from a Disney Channel movie. You will not find a ""Finding Nemo"" or a ""Wall-E"" on this one, just a simple ""sweet tale"" about a character struggling while finding young love (Except that it fails at that too, given not only that the main characters do not last together for long and that on the show the Miley Stewart/Hannah Montana character changes boyfriends as fast as she changes tampons). The love interest is so disgustingly clichéd that you might just laugh at his fakeness. The jokes, as expected coming from a Hannah Montana movie, are simply not funny at all. In fact, the entire movie gets so lame and predictable that it becomes yet another proof of how -for everyone's sake- Disney Channel's writers are ought to commit suicide.Now on the music (Or lack thereof). The soundtrack is just what would be expected by Hannah Montana: songs filled with self-references and childish squabble. Although it meets its purpose of making small children happy, it is nothing more than that.The movie includes a ridiculous Macarena wannabe ""dance song"" which is so incredibly complex that not even her fandom will replicate it without a severe amount of effort (Were they actually expecting people to dance the Howdown whatever? It's not like its simple, or easy for that matter). Miley Cyrus and her dad are simply not talented at all in the musical arena. The only song worth saving from this whole mess is The Climb, which is actually deep and thought provoking. If you are not a tormented parent who is being absolutely threatened by his daughter to go see this film with her, I implore you for your own sake, take that money elsewhere and save yourself the nuisance. Because in the end that is the only thing this is."

Turns out I was wrong.I went into this movie having never seen the show and with the impression that it would be some lame kids movie. After all, all my friends trash talk the show and make fun of it saying you're gay if you watch it. I was kind of skeptical to watch it, but, turns out it was an awesome movie.The movie is full of witty humor, the music is actually catchy, and I'm not the kind of guy that cries at movies and TV shows but this movie almost had me crying. It hit an emotional spot in me that I didn't think I had.For being a Disney movie, I honestly am impressed at what they produced. Miley Cyrus is a really good actress and has a good voice. I may even have a crush on her.After seeing the movie I decided to watch a few episodes of the show. It's a different atmosphere than the movie but still has that same witty humor.All in all, this is a great movie for anybody, and if you don't want to admit to watching it or you don't want anyone to know you've seen it, watch it alone. You won't regret it."
1033,tt1114677,1,"Miley Stewart's (Miley Cyrus) life is out of balance. Taken under the wing of a gungho and glamorous publicist, Vita (Vanessa Williams), Miley's letting Hannah begin to dominate her life. When she keeps choosing Hannah over her commitments to family members—to say goodbye to Jackson (Jason Earles) as he leaves for college, to attend Lilly's (Emily Osment) long-anticipated sweet-16 party or her grandmother's birthday celebration—it is clear Miley's beginning to forget why the Hannah Montana secret was created in the first place.When Hannah Montana ends up in a paparazzi-captured fight with Tyra Banks over a pair of designer shoes, Miley's father (Billy Ray Cyrus) quietly takes control. Having attempted to reason with her to no avail, Robby Ray tricks Miley into thinking she's going to New York as Hannah to perform when he's really taking her from Los Angeles back home to Crowley Corners, Tennessee. Miley's double life becomes even more complicated when she returns to Crowley Corners.She discovers that a reporter has somehow managed to track Hannah Montana to her hometown and is asking lots of questions of the locals. She also meets up with an old childhood friend, Travis Brody (Lucas Till), and soon finds herself in her first serious romance. When Miley tries to impress Travis by telling him about her friend Hannah Montana, she suddenly finds her alter ego enlisted in a concert fundraiser to help save her hometown's pristine Crowley Meadows from developers. Once again, having taken on more than she can handle, Miley has to call on her best friend, Lilly, and ask her for help. When Lilly finally arrives in Crowley Corners pretending to be Hannah Montana, events really spin out of control. Hannah Montana 1/10"
1034,tt1114677,2,"I think the idea of Hannah Montana as a movie was good, because it gave a chance for different types of audience to show what they think of it, and view it. so its for the young girls, and they probably love it, but if your not a female or under 12 years old you wont appreciate it. People are saying why rate it as a bad film because its not aimed at adults, well, if only 12 year old girls rated this film, it wouldn't be an accurate rating. Having people of all ages and backgrounds rate this film, shows an actual portrayal of the quality of the film. The girl has a good voice, but that doesn't make it a good film. personally i don't like her music either, but i can appreciate talent when i see it. unfortunately, the same doesn't go for the movie."
1035,tt1114677,2,"The setting for this movie should have been Wisconsin, not Tennessee because there was more cheesy cliché's than you could count. I took my 12 year old daughter to this and have seen many movies with her including the Lizzie McGuire movie (which i found very entertaining) and this was just plain bad. There were a few funny moments but for the most part it was just bad rip offs of the 3 stooges type comedy like the brother getting caught in the revolving door while everyone was going in and out. I thought Disney had a chance to really make a point of never forgetting where your roots are remembering your family comes first but they sadly missed the boat on both accounts instead focusing weakly on how Hannah is more important than being true to yourself. A very disappointing movie though I'm sure the kids enjoyed it."
1036,tt1114677,4,"At this writing, the rating is 3.0 with 8908 votes. I would have expected 3.5 It's fluff, poorly done, with wooden ""acting"" and the certainty of purpose it seems only a teen could take seriously... and yet its target audience loves it.And, although I hate to make the comparison, exactly what redeeming features did Elvis or Beatles movies have? In retrospect, not much.I've been lucky enough to only be forced to watch one episode of the series, and from what I can tell the movie is just more of the same. If science ever discovers a cure for whatever it is that makes kids like this stuff, great... otherwise, this is typical and there will be more.I will just add that I personally found absolutely no trace of realism or usefulness in this entire movie."
1037,tt1049413,1,"This film is possibly one of the best animated films of all time as it tells an emotional moving story while being funny. As I said the emotion in this film is full of heart and even though I didn't cry it will make most people cry. The characters in this are perfect even if it is a small character like Ellie or big character like Carl everybody gets so much development even Charles Muntz the villain of the film is also given development, even more than some superhero films nowadays. Also this film has comedy some Pixar films now just want to make you cry but in the 2000s they had mix of sad and funny moments. So overall this film is as close to perfect as an animated film can get, it is has a mix of emotions it is funny and sad when it needs to be it has so much heart and the characters are perfect. This film in my opinion is the best Pixar film."

Having know Frank Thomas and an admirer of his work and that of the group that went to South America, I found the film inspiring and thoughtful. I didn't want to rush through the film and savored how it took it's time and revisited each location. I would say that if you are unfamiliar with Disney history then this film will not hold the same meaning.I have a painting from that trip hanging in my sitting room painting by one of the Blairs.

The director is Stefan Ruzowitzky and he is also one of the writers who worked on adapting this modern piece of successful children's literature. If you take a look at the filmmaker's other stuff (not just the Oscar-winning ""Revanche""), you will find films that are pretty dark, pretty creepy at times even, so this family comedy is actually not exactly what you would expect from him. However, it also shows how popular children's films were back then here in Germany, still are today. This is also proved by the fact that the cast list is actually quite prominent. The (voice) actors include many names that are pretty familiar and known here in Germany. I will spare you the names, so you can check out the cast list for yourself. One interesting addition though is Pilar Bardem, even if she does not have too much screen time outside the first 10 minutes and yes she is Javier Bardem's mother and the one he thanked so graciously in his Oscar acceptance speech.This is the story of a girl who gets picked as the successor to the powers of a mighty good witch. A little dragon (voiced by comedian Michael Mittermeier, who did a pretty good job here) is out to talk to her and introduce her to the world of sorcery. At the same time, we are introduced to her family, her school mates, her teachers etc. This is really pretty much what you could expect and maybe even hope for if you hear about a German fantasy film about a little witch. It is a nice mix of ""normal"" life and life as a witch. There is no real depth to it, but that's okay. The fantastic references still keep audiences interested. At times it was difficult to see that Naujoks' clumsy antagonist character is really so smart and powerful to achieve what he achieves in this film, even if it is just temporary. Talking about temporary, the temporary transformation scene early on with Catterfeld playing a pretty hilarious role was one of the best of the entire film. By the way, in the second half it also reminded me a bit of Momo with the gray colors everywhere. As a whole, this is a film that got slightly worse in the second 40 minutes, but it's all good. I'd still call it an enjoyable outcome. Go see it if you can. I will certainly check out the sequel at some point too and I hope it is just as good."
1040,tt0436339,1,"This is the most enticing film I have ever watched. A true master piece displaying the true artistic integrity of film. The underlying themes of a monotheistic society exploring the themes of Christianity and the teachings of the lord. A true masterpiece that really is a work of art and one of the most fabulous film I have ever witnessed. Nicholas Cage has a Masterful performance as Speckles and should have won best supporting actor. This film is ground breaking in the way of unconventional story telling. I love this movie, it cured my depression. Thank you Hoyt Yeatman, beautiful film, 10/10"
1041,tt0436339,7,"I don't understand why this movie has a current rating of 4.7/10. I loved it! True, some characters could have been given a meatier role. But overall this is a good, sweet one with plenty of action and excellent animation. Penélope Cruz sounds sexy (as usual), and Nicholas Cage is unrecognizable as Speckles the mole (I didn't know it was him until I saw the credits), but he's terrific. And though they appeared for a total of a little over few minute, Bucky the hamster (who is a quarter ferret) and the three mice were adorable.I'll recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good laugh on a lazy afternoon. And for the kids! 7* out of ten!"
1042,tt0436339,6,"It is not all that bad, at least it tries its to be an enjoyable family movie flick. But as usual, Disney movies now are getting haters around the world due to its popular teens and live-action animals-talking movies. So now, when they see a live-action Disney movie whether it has teenagers singing or animals yapping away, they would be put off immediately. Whatever it is, G-force is fun with 3-D. Kids would like the cute animals coming near them.The story: G-Force has a simple story which is also not creative. But that it is not what kids want, they would want to see action blazing through their ways. As this being a Jerry Bruckheimer production, you can expect at least a car chase and some explosion but only more mild. Trevor Rabin did a good work in creating epic music. Though a kid movie, expect some rude humour but also at the same time, some lessons to teach your kids.Overall: Definitely not as bad as what haters say. In the end, it is just meant to be an enjoyable fun romp. You don't like animals talking, this is not for you. A good movie for the holiday. Just leave your brain at home if you want to enjoy this."
1043,tt0436339,5,"Who doesn't like guinea pigs? I wouldn't be surprised if Cavy sales rise after the impression these CG 3-D specimens create in the PG audience. Their mouths alone are cutely depicted and entertaining in their own right. I had read a small unflattering local review and didn't want to waste my time. My 8 yr. old Son, however, got his own idea from the trailers, and wondered how a ""review"" could possibly say it was ""no good"" as I had reported. So I took he and his 10 yr. old buddy to the matinée.I'll admit there were a couple of wordy moments where the illusion was broken for me, but on the whole, with the involving 3-D effects, there were enough chuckles and action to leave me wondering why it was trashed. I've seen much worse. I liked it better than Alvin & the Chipmunks, and Up... but I think Monsters VS Aliens was more re-watchable.As we left the chilly theater to enter the hot afternoon, I asked the boys what they thought. ""It was awesome!"" Well, not my exact thoughts but it wasn't a bad distraction from more serious current affairs."
1044,tt0436339,3,"Our kids are grown, but being a 6th grade teacher, I talked my wife into going and seeing this. In the first half hour there was no laughter coming from the audience. The 3-D was OK, but I expected more from Disney. You can tell it wasn't the Pixar people behind this film.I really expected to laugh and enjoy the FX ride, but the action sequences left me bored and I didn't fall in love with the characters. It was cute and might be OK for a 7,8 or 9 year old. Anyone younger won't understand the plot line and older kids will be bored. This film sure wasn't worth the ticket price.It was just a disappointment all the way around for me. Maybe Bruckheimer will get it right next time."
1045,tt0436339,7,"""G-Force"" is basically a kid's movie, so it should be judged as such. The story is about group of specially trained guinea pigs who were able to uncover a diabolical plan for world domination by the leading home appliance manufacturer. Not really a plot for an Oscar bait film, but for kids, it works.Being produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, the requisite slam-bang action sequences are also there. And since the characters animated, the possibilities for these sequences are limitless and only bound by the imagination of the animators. The guinea pigs are drawn to be very cute and lovable, and the audience is effectively drawn to root for them.I personally enjoyed the voice talents. I liked Penelope Cruz' voicing of the sassy girl guinea pig Juarez. Her delivery of her lines was sure and sexy (for a guinea pig). Hehe. Nicholas Cage's voice work for Speckles the genius mole is topnotch, and unrecognizable as him. For the human characters, I was surprised at the credits that the G-Force trainer Ben was actually Zach Galifianakis. He is definitely the polar opposite here of his character in ""The Hangover"" where I first saw him.Kids and the kids-at-heart will enjoy the cartoonish action of ""G-Force"". Hey, it is animated after all. Although with the excellent CG imagery of the animal characters are really so realistic. The kids and I had a great time. We did not even remember that we did not watch it in 3D. The action is very palpable even in regular 2D format."
1068,tt0780521,9,"I've said my share of disparaging words against the Walt Disney Company, and let's face it; they've put out more than their share of garbage over the years. It seems as if Pixar has been pulling their dead weight for the past decade as they've put out offensively bad DTV releases and pumping their money and resources into their sub par T.V. station and musical acts (though I will say that Lilo and Stitch, as well as The Emperor's New Groove, which I consider to be one of Disney's funniest releases). Yes, it seemed that all hope was lost for the Mouse and that anything original and thought provoking associated with the Disney name would have that cute little bouncing lamp right along side.Imagine my surprise when I saw The Princess and the Frog yesterday. Surprise nothing! I nearly went into a shock induced coma. This was a brilliant film, something truly worthy of Uncle Walt's iconic signature. This film had all the makings of a Disney classic: great story, great characters, great music, and of course, great art.One thing I always give the Walt Disney Co. credit for is their masterful art work in their features, even the less than stellar ones. This has, especially, been the case the past 20-25 years. Some of the same artists that worked on the more recent classics like The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast worked on Princess and the Frog. I was told after the film that the same man that drew Belle (Randy Cartwright) drew for Tiana, and you can tell. The art in general in this movie is extremely impressive. Not only are all the characters well drawn, but the backgrounds are breath taking, very reminiscent of Hunchback of Notre Dame. They seem to take you into a painting of the location without losing it's touch with reality. Also, the use of different art styles stood out, especially the ""Almost There"" number, which was drawn mostly in the Art Deco style.Randy Newman's score left the biggest impression on my after the film was over, though. I think this is the first time a Disney feature used, primarily, North American music styles like jazz, ragtime, southern gospel, and even zydeco. Of course, like any great Disney feature; Princess and the Frog had it's signature musical number: the previously named ""Almost There"". With a great tune, appropriate lyrics, and of course, the voice of Anika Noni Rose; I'm sure (and I hope) this will become another Disney standard. Unlike some Disney films, there wasn't that dreadful ""Oh dear merciful God, when is this going to end"" number. Every song was thought out, appropriate for it's setting, and just...good. Kudos to Randy Newman, who will hopefully get an Oscar nomination (at least) for this film.Then, of course, there's the high water mark for not only Disney movies, but for movies in general, especially animation films: characters and story. Movies can have an amazing score and even good animation, but if the story flops and if the characters are insufferable, then it's going nowhere. This movie, thankfully, had neither problem. There was no character that you wish would just go get himself or herself bent. Everyone served his or her purpose in the movie.Like many of the newer Disney movies, The Princess and the Frog had a, well...Princess character that was blue collar and hard working.Tiana is young woman from the slums of New Orleans, whose sole purpose in life is to open up a successful restaurant serving authentic Louisiana cuisine. Of course, the man puts her down and she finds herself sunk. I will say that I'm VERY proud of Disney for not shoving the race issue down our throats and, at the same time, for not avoiding it all together. This was seen in the scene where the land lords of the building she's looking to purchase.At the same time, a lazy hedonistic prince comes to New Orleans looking for a (Rich) bride since his monetary supply has been cut off by his parents. He sets his sights on a bona fide southern belle named Charlotte, Tiana's foil and best friend. The Prince and his reluctant English servant (what prince would be complete without one) get sidetracked by a voodoo man/street performer named Dr. Facilier aka ""The Shadow Man"", a slick deceitful crook with his own silhouette as a side kick (and yes, they are able to make it work). Dr. Facilier says both Prince Naveeh and Lawerence will get what they both desire most (money and a life without servitude, respectively). Louis is turned into the Prince (or at least, given his body) while Naveeh turns into...a smiley frog; which as we learn throughout the film is mucus.Naveeh meets Tiana after she changes clothes (and after her dreams of owning her own restaurant). Tiana, who is less than fond of frog, tries to kill our hero; but later finds out that this is a frog with a difference...he can talk. After Naveeh sees a copy of a print version of, appropriately enough, the Princess and the Frog, he asks Tiana (Who is wearing a tiara at the time) to kiss him, believing that she is, indeed, royalty herself; though he later finds out that she is a waitress. He promises that after she kisses him, something she is far from enthusiastic about, he will make her dream of owning her own restaurant a reality. Well, she does kiss him, but there's a bit of a SNAFU: she turns into a frog herself. The two of them must find a way to become human again. Along the way, they meet a cavalcade of characters including a trumpet playing alligator (and yes, they are able to make it work somehow) and a Cajun firefly named Ray.The Princess and the Frog, a movie (I hope) that is destined for greatness."
1069,tt0780521,9,"The Princess and the Frog is one of the most highly anticipated films of the year. It marks Walt Disney Animation Studio's return to 2D animation, to recapture the era of amazing movies like The Little Mermaid, Aladdin and Beauty and the Beast – timeless tales that have reached audiences across the world. However, unlike these previous movies, The Princess and the Frog does something new. It's an updated take on the classic fairy tale, set in Jazzy New Orleans filled with witch doctors, Maldonian princes, southern lovesick daughters, Jazz playing alligators and even Cajun fireflies! In the midst of all this jazz is Disney's first black princess, Tiana, and her story.Tiana is a young girl who wants to follow her father's dream and open up her very own restaurant. She works hard, never taking a chance on Prince Charming to sweep her off her feet - she is a realist Disney 'princess' - and that makes her stand apart from the rest. And speaking of breaking from tradition, Prince Naveen is another fresh take on the classic Disney prince. He gets a fair amount of screen time and shows us that princes are more than just stuffy suits. The pair has great chemistry as frogs and their intertwining journey is full of laughs and heart tingling moments sprinkled with some good old Disney magic. Disney Animation Studios has pulled it off again; they have conjured up something fresh and new and have made it entertaining. Perhaps we can expect greater things for the future because this is a pretty good start.One of the strongest aspects of this musical is, of course, the music! Randy Newman has provided an array of songs, from bouncy piano songs to gospel to Broadway. There is no one single style of music and Newman serves up a diverse platter accompanied by stunning animation. There are several songs in the movie, perhaps more than needed, but all catchy while bringing a yet another flavor to New Orleans. The downside to these songs is that they are many, short and have the task of pushing story. Their presence feels like designated intervals, sometimes jarring up moments which could have been executed wonderfully without any song.Pacing and story are the main challenges The Princess and the Frog faces. Too much happens and it happens too fast. There is an engaging plot, obstacles are overcome through action and songs also push the story forward. This leaves us very little time for dwelling in scene. I personally think this is why the movie doesn't feel quite up to par with The Little Mermaid, Aladdin, Beauty or The Lion King – there are very few moments which rely on deeper truths or engage with characters' inner struggles and relationships. I wish the directors would have slowed down and let us have a bit more interaction rather than relying on action and songs to advance plot. Also, some crucial events relied on coincidence when they could've been worked into the plot more skillfully. Despite these minor drawbacks, the Princess and the Frog still delivers an entertaining story.Personally, I think the darker a Disney film is, the more interesting it will be. It lends a sense of reality and tells me that despite its catchy songs and humor, the movie takes itself seriously. Princess and the Frog definitely takes itself seriously. One of the main reasons I wanted to see this film was because of Dr. Facilier. He makes the film tastefully dark and shows us that even a Disney story can chill audiences. The voodoo world is intoxicating, full of intrigue and Facilier's theme song tells us he is a villain with style rivaling the likes of Jafar or Scar. However, unlike the previous villains, Facillier doesn't constantly trump the heroes after his first appearance. Villains kind of get a backseat in the movie - some people might not like this so beware! Despite its darker side, the movie is surprisingly funny and downright hilarious. Like the old classics, the movie is timeless in a way. It doesn't reference any modern pop culture. There are lots of things that made audiences laugh, some more than others. There is no one type of humor strung throughout the whole film. Without giving anything away, I would also like to say the humor gets pretty risqué at times but it's welcoming because it tells us Disney is not excluding anyone from the audience. There are some very spectacular moments of animation in this film. The characters are drawn in the 90's classic Disney style and don't have extremely stylized or exaggerated features that we've seen in later works like Emperor's New groove or Home on the Range. This blast from the past is a breath of fresh air. 2D animation is here to stay."
1051,tt1223150,7,"Wonderfully entertaining documentary from writer-director Theodore Thomas, working alongside the Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures distribution arm, chronicles a turbulent time in Mr. Disney's life: the years 1940 and 1941, when an animators strike and the looming threat of a dominant union threatened to tear the Disney Company apart. With the war in Europe putting a financial damper on Disney's output overseas, ""Pinocchio"" and ""Fantasia"" fell into the red, causing Walt to owe the bank four million dollars. An invitation, then, from President Roosevelt for Disney and his hand-picked team to make a good will tour of South America came as a godsend, although Disney was initially reluctant to travel through Latin America ""just shaking hands"". He turned the trip to his advantage, however, and released two pictures dedicated to the culture of our neighbors and their people, ""Saludos Amigos"" in 1942 and ""The Three Caballeros"" in 1944. Looking back, the movies, though certainly entertaining, were just a stop-gap while Disney came up with bigger ideas, but the underlying notion here--that Walt felt utterly betrayed by his employees--lends this documentary a tough emotional core. Walt also lost his father during the trip, and one senses the emotional weight on him as he is photographed on boats and emerging from planes, waving at the crowds. This is a beautifully-produced sentimental journey, wherein still shots come to life and (now-aged) witnesses and relatives recount this fascinating chapter in Disney history. *** from ****"
1052,tt1223150,5,"This is a highly nostalgic look back at a very long goodwill tour Walt Disney took along with a group of artists from his studio. Apparently, there was an animators strike going on and no work was being done, so Walt accepted an offer from the State Department to go on a visit of several South American nations--and to get inspiration for some projects incorporating South American culture. Unfortunately, there are some major problems with the film even though in some ways the documentary can be engaging. First, the people involved in this tour are mostly dead and the sources are almost exclusively second-hand and third-hand. Second, the pacing was slow...glacially slow. The film could easily have had half an hour trimmed, as so much of the film was filler. Too many long musical sequences where nothing is being said. And, thirdly (and this will surely ruffle some feathers), the projects inspired by the trip were incredibly bland. I know some Disney-philes out there might be having palpitations when I say this, but I have always hated ""Saludos Amigos"" and ""The Three Caballeros"". So, as the people in the film are reminiscing fondly, I am left feeling a bit confused--because what they are talking about sounds great but the films certainly were not! As a result of all this, the film is one I'd recommend only to the staunchest Disney fans. Otherwise, it's slow going and not nearly as interesting as you might expect.By the way, one of the video extras on this new release is ""Saludos Amigos"". I gave it another watch to see if it was as bad as I remembered. It was."
1053,tt1223150,5,"Walt Disney's sojourn in South America on behalf of the Roosevelt Administration's ""Good Neighbor Policy"" would make for an interesting film, but this isn't it. The film is not so much a documentary as a dry recitation of the itineraries of the people involved, often read by surviving family members, with little or no perspective into what the trip meant (save for allowing legendary design artist Mary Blair to blossom professionally) and what it ultimately accomplished. Some of the footage is interesting, but rarely does any of it contain the energy of the poster image of Walt swinging a lasso. While Disney's appearance in S.A. was no question big news down there, the film implies that it was also unique. Other Hollywood figures--notably Orson Welles--were also sent down south by FDR (and in Welles' case the almost-result was the unfinished ""It's All True""), while other South American performers were invited up to Hollywood. Perhaps most telling is the subtext that runs throughout the film, blaming the 1941 strike at the Disney studio, which forced it to unionize, as the factor that killed both the studio's spirit and its brief Golden Age of innovation, a dubious (but Disney-sanctioned) interpretation of the facts. This isn't a terrible film, just not a particularly interesting or informative one."
1054,tt0976238,2,"""Old Dogs"" is simply mind numbingly awful. It's like two hours of being raped in the face by fart jokes. Is it funny to see Seth Green pretend to get hit in the balls? Well then this is totally up your alley. When people talk about how films are getting worse this is what they are talking about. The inexplicable amount of decent ratings for this mess of idiocy kind of explains why the publishing industry is tanking. I refuse to admit I live in a world where those who enjoy this dreck actually know how to read.""Old Dogs"" is an ugly artless stupid film that has been created only to keep your kids quiet for a couple hours; although making them sit through this should legally be on the same level as child abuse. In a couple years we will forget this ever existed."
1055,tt0976238,6,"I went to see the new family comedy Old Dogs expecting not to like it. The only reason that made me think it wasn't gonna be garbage was the great cast, so I gave it a shot. I was surprised to say I actually sort of liked it. The film stars Robin Williams and John Travolta as Dan and Charlie, two businessmen and long-time best friends. One day, Dan's ex-girlfriend, Vicki (Kelly Preston) takes him to dinner and says she's going to jail. She tells him of how her friend's gonna to watch after the kids and how he needs to check in on them every once in a while. To further explain this scenario, the kids are Dan's kids. When Dan puts Vicki's friend in the hospital, Dan is forced to watch after the kids with a little unenthusiastic help from Charlie. If this plot sounds bad, then you're on the same page as me. The surprise element of this movie is that it's actually pretty damn funny. It doesn't hurt that a great supporting cast including Lori Loughlin, Justin Long, Matt Dillon, Seth Green, and the late Bernie Mac are in it. Obviously this is not a perfect film, nor should it be, and it's not for everyone, but I certainly found it funny enough. Check it out because you may feel the exact same way I feel about this film walking out of the theater."
1056,tt0976238,6,"While looking for a family Thanksgiving movie, I realized I had only 2 options, this or Twilight. Since there was no way in hell I was going to see Twilight I decided to read some review and go see this. Oh god the reviews were awful. After seeing this film I will admit, its not THAT bad. The acting is for the most part good, and some of the jokes are funny.Admittedly this joke runs way to long, and not to spoil it but the producers could have cut at LEAST 15mins out of it, that drag the whole movie down. Id go see it again, at least it doesn't have glittering vampires."
1057,tt0976238,8,This was a fun family movie. Not too taxing on the brain and plenty of laughs. A few toilet jokes kept the kids amused and a few well placed adult puns made me smile.I just wish that the television trailers hadn't shown ALL the good bits - which took away all the surprise funny bits and really just left the mushy stuff in between to watch....Travolta and Williams are living breathing classics and make the movie well worth watching.I simply can't understand the low overall rating this movie has received up until now - it really ain't that bad....
1058,tt0976238,2,"You worked hard for your paycheck; which is a lot more than can be said for anybody involved with this movie. Like an old dog that needs a bath, this thing stinks something awful.Robin Williams and John Travolta have done better. Unfortunately, in this outing, neither delivers. It's not enough to prance into camera view, and call that acting. To label their performances as ""phoned in"" is being too generous. All they do is mug and mechanically recite lines. ""Warm and fuzzy"" scenes look contrived and phony, ""comical"" scenes are about as funny as having your teeth pulled out with a wrench and no anesthesia. And no, even anesthesia won't help you endure this movie.The ""touchy-feely"" premise is this: two obnoxious swinging single mid-life-crisis guys, are old friends and business partners. Through some dumb circumstances (one has kids he didn't know about-so original yecch), they wind up with two kids to care for. Idiotic? Yes. Original, no. Interesting; definitely not. Writing is flat, the rest of the cast is flat, the plot is flat, and the director should be banned from making movies ever again. The story goes nowhere, and is never involving. The characters are not likable, and the intended laughs are as sparse as igloos in the Sahara desert. It even stoops to the old groin injury bit: sad.At least the title makes sense. It's all old stuff. And it's a dog."
1059,tt0976238,9,"Don't believe the reviews that say it stinks. It's just got a low key vibe, and if you need a ton of clever dialogue or special effects to keep your interest then of course you won't appreciate the subtlety of what are portrayals of real relationships. Although the movie starts out feeling like a bachelor gone wild party, and you don't get the feeling that it is a family movie, it gains momentum and totally turns into a respectable family film. My husband and I found it endearing, well acted, hilarious in spots, and we weren't worried about watching it with our four-year old in the room. Thoroughly enjoyable movie, although we could have done without the first ten minutes."
1060,tt0976238,1,"This is the movie that has me rethinking the policy of the Cultural Lifetime Pass. If you made a record or a painting or a movie that helped lift up the standards of culture and made the world a better place, even for a brief moment, then I think you should get a pass if you're forced to make dreck to put food on the table.I was ready to give Robin Williams his pass for ""Reality...What a Concept,"" ""Moscow on the Hudson"" and ""Insomnia."" John Travolta had a potential pass for ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Get Shorty."" Seth Green gave us ""Robot Chicken."" Matt Dillon, Bernie Mac, Amy Sedaris, Ann-Margaret, for God's sake....Ladies and gentlemen, no longer. I hereby revoke your passes.This movie was a pile of trite, clichéd garbage. You could have slotted any other actors into these roles, and you would have gotten the same result: a lot of mugging, a lot of canned reactions, and a lot of tired nutshot jokes. This was such bland pablum that I should have walked out, but I was dragged to this flick with family.So, was the paycheck worth it? Probably, seeing how so many people gave it a 10 rating and are mocking the critics who rightly called out this turd for what it is. More and more people will pay good money to see Seth Green get cuddled by a gorilla or watch Williams and Travolta go through the same list of gay panic jokes (with a little racism thrown in for extra flavor) that was excreted on screen for ""Wild Hogs."" Keep polishing that turd, folks; it won't change what it is.Don't force the ones you love to see this movie. Stay home. Read a book. Play a board game. Do anything but see this waste of time. Please, for the sake of the children, I beg you: do the merciful thing and put down ""Old Dogs."""
1061,tt0976238,1,"Oh My God this was the funniest movie. It kept my husband and myself laughing through out the movie. Just good clean humor.John's daughter and wife were terrific...I would recommend this movie to any age group.I had read the reviews and disagree with the negative ones. I just don't understand how anyone could not like it. It went by fast, certainly kept our attention and we laughed until hurt. Actually the entire audience laughed through out the movie. All the actors were great, they worked well with each other, and although it may have been predictable, it was delightful"
1062,tt0976238,6,"There were no other family flicks out that my older kids would sit through, so we decided to give Old Dogs a shot. I have to say that we laughed very hard and enjoyed it. This is a kids/family film, and in that context it delivers. It certainly is not a bad film. John Travolota and Robin Williams work well together and make this film worth seeing. I hope they have a chance to collaborate again as they have good chemistry. There were some surprises in the plot, which is unusual for most kid films. This film is not going to be an academy award winner, but it certainly was not a waste of time. I expected to be bored and found myself laughing from beginning to end. I want to thank the producers for making a family film that is worth seeing. The kids loved it and when that happens they develop a loyalty to the actors and trust them to deliver again the in future. I hope that is the case."
1063,tt0976238,8,"John Travolta and Robin Williams are a great comedic duo with their slapstick comedy throughout this movie. This movie shows what best friends are like and what situations friends get you into. Friends will stand by you no matter what your situation is. Never make a promise to a kid unless you can make it happen. Even though you might have trouble with parenting at first, you will get the hang of it and find a better person you never knew you could become. Once you have decisions that you have already made it's hard to go through with them when you want something else.It shows you real life situations of what could happen if you find out something unexpected in your life and anyone can relate to these situations. All of this will be shown throughout this movie which makes it an interesting one to watch. Robin Williams has been out of the picture for some time, but was last seen as the voice of Roosevelt in the latest ""Night at the Museum"" and in ""Worlds Greatest Dad."" John Travolta I had last seen as Ryder as the train hijacker on ""The Taking of Pelham 123"" which is a really great action movie starring Denzel Washington too. Both actors have come a long way and are going through tough times in their lives.They come out shinning in this movie made by Disney and are very funny and fun to watch in this movie together. Also Bernie Mac has made an appearance in this movie and it was great to see him since he will be forever missed. This movie will have you laughing throughout and leaves you with a great message in the ending."
1064,tt0780521,1,"As a young female twenty-something, my 90's childhood was shaped by the Golden Age of Disney. Every year, there would be a new masterpiece for my mom to take me to; Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King, Aladdin ... And when Disney failed so terribly in the early millennium and closed down shop, my heart was broken. There was a part of our culture and my life that my little girl I someday hope to have was never going to be able to experience, and I was never going to get back.So as soon as I heard that Disney was coming out with their triumphant return to 2-D, I felt like the world was FINALLY getting its act together.While CGI has produced some good hits, it isn't the same as 2-D. There was no one who could do cartoons like Disney, and I think they began to realize that.I can honestly say that this movie is brilliant. I saw it last night, and it's still haunting me twenty-four hours later like I'd just walked out of the theater. If this movie had been A.) racist or B.) a let down, I would have been very angry and wouldn't take the time to write out this review. But my God, it was right up there alongside ""Beauty and the Beast"" and ""The Lion King."" Tiana, the long-awaited princess of the film, is a (gasp) real person! Her whole life does not revolve around getting married to the prince, nor does it involve some odd and harried ""I'm totally a hardkore awesome person"" plot. She has her faults. She's brash, a workaholic, and kind of a judgmental jerk. However, she is also headstrong, loving, and ridiculously intuitive. This is the sort of woman we need in a Disney cartoon for our kids to look up to, especially when the best role model they've had in the past few years is Bella Swann.The prince, Naveen, is also an actual human being. He's cocky, spoiled, and hilarious. However, as the movie goes on, it is made quite clear (in a song by Randy Newman) that Naveen isn't happy at all. His and Tiana's relationship is based on self-discovery and mutual respect, rather than some of the other Disney movies where it is completely based on the need for a romantic plot. I see Belle and the Beast and Shang and Mulan (pre Mulan II, we can pretend that sequel doesn't exist), rather than Cinderella and Prince Charming. It seems like ""Enchanted"" really did bring a lot of new ideas to the Disney creed, and it completely shows in the way they tackle their archetypes in this refreshing rendition.I was skeptical when I heard Randy Newman had composed the music. And yes, folks, it is in fact musical style. The characters sing, not Randy. And while you can still tell it's Randy, it's also Disney. The jazzy complexity of the songs drive the story forward and just wrap you up into the buzzing momentum of the film. I will definitely grab this soundtrack and play it religiously on my ipod, I promise you that.As for the racism: It's Disney and regardless of what Disney does, someone is going to find something to point out as racist. However, let me just say that this movie is completely respectful and absolutely nothing in it is racist, to the point where it is obvious that Disney is trying their hardest NOT to be racist and cuts corners on the storytelling and historical racism that WOULD have been in New Orleans in 1920 (and to an extent, yes, still is). And as for turning Tiana into a frog ... she's a human for a good half the movie before she even thinks about kissing Naveen. She's a black princess, she's not a frog princess.I also saw a comment about how someone didn't like it because of the non-Christian message thanks to the use of voodoo? They were so busy looking at the BAD GUY use voodoo that they didn't realize that Terrence Howard's character was pretty much a walking sermon! ""You can wish on a star, but that can only take you halfway?"" Where does this sound familiar? ""Never lose sight of what's most important ... love."" My God, the complete non-Christian message is abhorrent! The star is used as an allegory for God, and they wish on it with their hands folded ... practically one could say praying? And let's not even go into the full moral of the story: ""You know what you want, but dig a little deeper and find what you need."" How about that whole thanking God for unanswered prayers sort of ideal? These are good and wholesome lessons that are going to really strengthen the next generation of both boys and girls, and I'm happy that it's going to be an influence on the younger generation.And the writing is amazing. As someone who writes for a living, I was completely floored at the structure of this film. You cover so much ground in 90 minutes, and you are never bored nor know what's going to happen next! Disney knows what they're doing (finally) on this film. It's amazingly put together, and all the trademarks you expect to see (animal sidekicks, creepy awesome villain, amazing soundtrack, knockout visuals, strong heroine) are there in full. Go see this movie, and remember how it was to be a kid again. This is an experience you absolutely need to have.""Princess and the Frog"" is here to stay."
1065,tt0780521,9,"Michael Eisner will forever be known as the man that attempted to totally kill Disney animation. After the disastrous efforts of Home on the Range, what was once a staple of the Walt Disney Company was becoming a thing of the past. Traditional animation was dead in Disney, and this was definitely one of the major contributors towards the shift in upper-upper management and his departure. Now with Pixar and John Lasseter on board, Disney pulls absolutely no punches in their return to tradition. There's a new princess, she happens to be black, and they happen to twist a classic story so much that you have literally no clue in which direction the writers were going. The major question is: can Disney revive its Renaissance quality that it experienced in the 90s? Can they ever duplicate such magic again? The answer is a resounding yes. Princess and the Frog is the best traditionally animated flick (from ANY company) since The Emperor's New Groove. Princess Tiana is the most sophisticated and most mature Disney princess since Belle. The villain here is the best since Hades from Hercules. Prince Naveen is the best prince since Prince Eric (and even then, Naveen is one of the better princes out there). The music here is actually some of the best music from any Disney movie past and present. The animation here is the best since The Lion King. Basically, to sum things up, Princess and the Frog is an excellent effort from Disney and a superb return to Renaissance quality that the company sorely missed and needed.The movie focuses on a hard-working waitress (Anika Nosi Rose) that is saving money to open up her own restaurant, which was a dream her father had always been chasing. Her father also taught her that it's not enough to just wish for something, you have to also work to accomplish what you want in life. Tiana lives her life on this lesson, much to the disdain of others. After a few twists and turns (I don't want to spoil the plot too much), she becomes a frog thanks to Prince Naveen (Bruno Campos), whom is a prince that is very different from the norm in terms of personality and even royalty status. Along the way they will meet a wide assortment of characters, ranging from a charismatic magician (Keith David, in an amazing role), a friendly firefly (Jim Cummings), a music-loving alligator (Michael-Leon Wooley), and many others. The movie clocks in at less than 100 minutes, but moves at such a fast pace, you'll get a lot more material than your average hour-and-a-half movie.Let's just put this out there: Disney treated Tiana and her surroundings perfectly and without overdoing any boundaries whatsoever. New Orleans has an incredibly energetic look, and just enhances the themes and plot of the movie. Accompanying the Louisiana flavor is the incredible score of Randy Newman, which uses a wide variety of sounds and genres from the Deep South (and also is mixed in with a little Newman touch).Can we praise the animation one more time? Sure, why not. The movie looks absolutely beautiful, and doesn't rely on just a simple palette of colors. Thanks to technology and an obvious overload of effort, this is one of the most (if not the most) colorful and vibrant-looking Disney animated movies of all-time. Some of the added computer effects only enhance the sophistication of the animation (I rhymed). One final note, the visual humor in Princess and the Frog is very fast-paced, to the style of the severely underrated Emperor's New Groove. You need a watchful eye on certain scenes to catch all the jokes.If there was anyone that was going to save Disney's traditional animation, it would be Ron Clements and John Musker. These two were the most responsible for the Disney Renaissance, directing Little Mermaid, Aladdin, and Hercules. They once again provide a beautiful story, and direct the movie with plenty of flair and energy. The musical sequences fit the pacing of the flick, and while there wasn't an outstanding track like ""Be Our Guest,"" ""Friend Like Me,"" or ""Under the Sea,"" the repertoire of musical numbers overall was quite impressive. A key part to a great animated movie is having a villain just as complex and/or engaging as the heroes; and the ""Shadow Man"" not only has the best musical number, but also has the most flair of any of the supporting characters. Now we can forgive them for directing Treasure Planet.The biggest reason for the successful quality in Princess and the Frog comes from the Pixar touch. Pixar obviously lent a hand here, as this movie contains some of the most sentimental and touching animated footage since the epic heartbreak moment in Lion King when Simba sees Mufasa motionless. While the movie never nails the emotional torture that Up succeeded (then againfew films ever will), Princess and the Frog will make you cry just as easily as it can make you laugh. Don't let that bring you down though, because this movie carries an upbeat tempo throughout the entire run.Bottom Line: If you enjoyed the Disney Renaissance (From Little Mermaid to Tarzan, before the downfall spiral started), then it is up to you to watch this movie. This movie has all the energy, quality, sentimentality, and superb animation of the 90s Disney flicks, and is inches away from Pixar status. Pixar has saved Disney altogether, and Princess and the Frog is hopefully going to save Disney traditional animation, granted it gets the praise and success it truly deserves. Unlike what we have been seeing in the past, Disney did not half-arse this time. Blending the old-school qualities with a new-school outlook on where the status of animation and storytelling is headed, Princess and the Frog is a fun, entertaining, and fulfilling ride from start to finish."
1066,tt0780521,1,"Just astounding. The story was genuinely touching, the intense scenes jumped out at you, the humor was funny, the acting was excellent, and the music was the best soundtrack of any Disney movie since The Little Mermaid (A standing ovation for Randy Newman). There is also something about the 2D animation - it just has more personality and emotion than CGI. I just saw it tonight, and I am honestly floored.Disney, for the last few years, has suffered from a lack of creativity. The movies have all been interchangeable with the same plot recycled. This one is different, new and really just the best animated picture I've seen in a long, long time. The applause in the theatre was very much earned."
1067,tt0780521,1,"I was privileged to attend a showing of The Princess and the Frog last night as part of a special engagement at New York City's Zeigfeld theater. This movie exceeded all expectations. It is visually stunning, musically a work of genius, thematically sophisticated, and story-wise told in a refreshingly different way (some actions are pre-motivation) which makes the ride an unpredictable one. Visually, Disney has gone above and beyond. They have invoked the steamy feeling of the city of New Orleans in shades of gold and lavender, and in the swamp scenes, some of the backgrounds are so expertly rendered it's like you're looking at a photograph. But what stood out the most with this artwork was the colors. They are a study in thematic contrast. In the scenes with the villain, the bright colors of Mardi Gras are used to reveal a darker, sinister side. The effect is wonderfully jarring and creates an appropriate emotional response: rather than hating the villain, we're led to mistrust him. He's pretty on the outside, but there's something awful lurking underneath. It's like that sixth sense you get sometimes with certain people in your life. In Mama Odie's scene, the color scheme is subtle and muted—until she reveals her inner goodness, and the scene explodes with color; another comment on how purity can hide in the most surprising places. To say that once again Randy Newman has done an expert job with the music would be an understatement. He had a lot to work with here—the musical tapestry of New Orleans is a mix of Dixieland, Zydeco, and Spiritual. He could have easily chosen one of those styles and stuck with it—instead, he blends all three, and the effect is seamless. The musical numbers tend to stay in one vein or the other depending on the character – which also works to help tell the story -- but the underlying score, while you'll instantly recognize Newman's hallmark sound, is a genius integration. To top it off, because this film takes place in the golden age of jazz, he has deftly inserted musical references to Gershwin. Amazing. With so much to work with, it could have easily been a confusing or even chaotic train-wreck. Not in his hands.Thematically, this film has taken some of Disney's classic themes and examined them more deeply: they are two-sided and complex. The choices these characters make are never easy--more so than in other films--and that updates these themes so that modern audiences can more readily identify. Similarly, Disney's newest princess, Tiana, is the strongest, most interesting princess to date. She is intelligent, complex – and oozes passion, something that, in my opinion, has only been approached (and I do insist, ""approached"") in Belle and Ariel. Tiana is a princess for today's woman. Little girls of the world have quite an exciting and refreshing new role model. Disney's writers have chosen to tell this story in a different way, as well. It's not your typical spell-it-all-out up-front story, and some story elements are never even vocalized, they're visual, and back story and motivation are sometimes revealed after the relevant action rather than before. It was really refreshing to see Disney choose a slightly different construction—it leads to keeping the tale unpredictable and much more engaging. But I'm a writer, so I know it's hard to do this well. For the most part, Disney succeeds. However, there is a bit of a downside to this. Constructing a story in this manner can lead to a lot of subtlety in the way the story is told, and because of this, some of the characters' motives are not always clear right away. This seems to happen the most with Dr. Facilier, the villain. When he's on the screen, it's really important to concentrate or you might miss some key story elements.All in all, don't miss The Princess and the Frog. It's the best 97 minutes I've spent in a theater in a long, long time."
1070,tt0780521,8,"Disney was at its best in the 90s. They came out with such great movies as Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King, and The Hunchback of Notre Dame. And then, they made bad movies like Home on the Range. Disney can make good movies, and they usually do. The Princess and the Frog is one of Disney's best movies. It has a great twist on a classic story, characters that made me care, and music that had me tapping my foot and wishing I was in New Orleans. The animation is so beautiful that I literally almost cried at the beginning of the film. Dr. Faciler is probably one of Disney's best villains. Keith David's voice is so creepy and fits perfect into the character. His song ""Friends on the Other Side"" is great and shows just how scary he can be. In most Disney movies, there are usually two or three songs that really stick with you. Every song in this movie was great. I still find myself humming ""Down in New Orleans"" everywhere I go. The bottom line is that Princess and the Frog is one of Disney's best and one of the best films of the year. The only question I can't answer is if it is better than Up. But if I have to answer, I'd say it's equal to it."
1071,tt0780521,9,"With such disappointments as Home on the Range and Chicken Little, Walt Disney Animation Studios – on the whole – has had a pretty rough decade. Last November, however, the Mouse House released Chris Williams and Byron Howards' Bolt, which is not only generally accepted as a return to form for the studio, but over the course of this past year, has usurped Pulp Fiction as my personal favorite movie of all time. With that said, I went into The Princess and the Frog with relatively high expectations; having walked out of the theatre just a couple of hours ago, I have to say that John Musker and Ron Clements' latest - while not overthrowing it - certainly continues the magic of the studio's previous film.Visually, The Princess and the Frog is absolutely mesmerizing. Seriously, 2D animation has never looked better than it does in this film. As executive producer/Pixar founder John Lasseter said, it's very much like stepping into a pair of old, comfortable shoes. Familiar, yet seemingly brand new. The energetic look of New Orleans is perfectly captured on screen, enhancing the story all the more.Speaking of which, the story of this film is just like the animation in that, while being traditional Disney fare, it's executed in such a way that it feels completely different from anything you've ever experienced. As many times as this movie will make you laugh, it'll make you cry, which – for me – has always been the sign of a classic Disney Animation film. The movie also succeeds in making you feel invested in each and every one of these characters, major and minor ones alike, which is definitely one of the most difficult tasks that any film could hope to achieve.Unlike most Disney princesses, Tiana is strong, independent, and isn't looking for her Prince Charming. In fact, it's these differentiating traits of hers that make Tiana my favorite Disney princess to date. It also helps that Anika Noni Rose delivers a stunning performance as her voice, making Tiana all the more captivating every moment that she's on screen. Bruno Campos also does a terrific job as Naveen, whose character is also a departure from the traditional Disney prince. He's a fellow who, while being stuck-up and lazy, somehow manages to come across as extremely likable. Both of these characters make for what is easily the most convincing Disney couple to date.The real stand-out performance, however, is that of Keith David as Dr. Facilier. Since his performance as the Arbiter from the Halo video game series, I've been a huge fan of this guy's work, and couldn't have been more excited when I heard that he'd be doing the voice of the villain in this movie. With his low, creepy voice, David captures the essence of this character perfectly, and by the end, you're genuinely scared of this guy. Because of this, Facilier is definitely one of – if not my absolute favorite – Disney villain, challenged only by Gaston and Frollo. With his performance as the Cat from Coraline, and now Facilier, Keith David continues to prove that he is the man.As with every other aspect of the film, the musical numbers in The Princess and the Frog are extremely memorable, most notably Dr. Facilier's ""Friends On the Other Side"", a deliciously creepy piece that ranks right up there with ""Hellfire"" from Hunchback of Notre Dame as one of the best Disney villain songs. You'll definitely find yourself humming several of these tunes on your way back home from the theatre.The Princess and the Frog is an excellent return to 2D animation. The animation is more beautiful than ever, the characters are some of the most memorable ones I've ever seen on film, and the musical numbers are infectiously catchy. The Princess and the Frog clearly reiterates the statement already made by last year's aforementioned Bolt: Walt Disney Animation is back and here to stay."
1072,tt0780521,1,"I felt like a little kid again seeing The Princess and the Frog; apparently so did most of the theater, as the crowd seemed to be generally from 8-30 years old. From the second I walked in, I realized this was a movie that was going to span groups(and it did, in the end). The other adults in line with me split almost evenly with tickets for this versus Invictus.The animation is gorgeous, the characters are absolutely unique and took me by surprise, and even the parts in trailers that I thought were going to be awful turned out to be brilliant when put into the context of the rest of the film. I haven't enjoyed Disney this much since Mulan(and vaguely, Brother Bear). The music also seems to permeate the movie; many people that review and find something wrong, find so much song and dance to be odd- but what they don't realize is that the movie itself was always intending to play off of the Jazz era it is set in. If you love music, however, you'll love this even more. The music is what gives all the more charm to it, and it pays off.The only reason that I am giving this a nine of ten is because I try to never give movies a ten unless it literally changed my life somehow. This came close, though- I was having so many flashbacks to my childhood during the Disney Renaissance. It was nostalgic for me, above all, and classic Disney animation that I will probably end up spending more money on when such moments roll around. I am most certainly going to find the soundtrack, because the music just made it so alive.Don't be misled by the word cartoon- this is a movie for everyone."
1073,tt1014759,6,"I attended the Cast and Crew screening on Sunday, in Leicester Square, with high hopes for this film as it's without doubt the most exciting job I've had. This was my first feature experience, and working for Tim Burton was a hell of a way to start.But, even as someone with a lot of time for his films, and a pre-existing bias, I couldn't really connect with this. The cast acquit themselves well, especially considering the noted difficulty in emoting to a tennis ball on a stick, but all their tics and quirks seem to be masking a void at the centre of what should be a free-floating, evocative trip. Sure, it's weird looking, but we've seen it before, and back then in films like Edward Scissorhands it had a sense of purpose. Now we're left exploring a CGI wonderland that seems to be without a great deal of wonder. The book revels in its bizarre environs, absurd dialogue and whimsical characters. This film grounds them, drains them of that mystery and leaves us with a colourful but forgettable retread. It seems intent on driving us to a narrative conclusion that few people will have had much stake in through its running time, simply because we're not giving much to care for.With a source material so familiar, even to those whose knowledge is second hand references, there needs to be a degree of innovation (as in Svenkmejer's dark stop-motion version, or the co-opting of Terry Gilliam in to his ""Tideland"" narrative), or else a studious and inspired adaptation that completely returns to Lewis Carroll. What we end up with is a mid-point that fails to get to grips with what enchants people about the Alice story, and another chance to see a beautiful waif walk around twisted, quasi-Gothic landscapes to a score by Danny Elfman.Not that this isn't an enjoyable experience in itself, and as seen in the vast Screen 1 at the Empire it is at times breathtakingly pretty. It's just inessential, and while it may be unfair to expect a classic from a favoured filmmaker every time out, when they tackle something with the pedigree and history of Alice In Wonderland you can't help but hope for something special. And that's the problem, that Tim Burton, while he is still making decent films, has been a long way off special for some time now.6/10 (if they gave half stars it'd be 6.5), but that doesn't mean it's a bad film. It's possible that my grade is affected by high expectations and lost potential. If you have kids, I'm sure it'll be better than 90% of the dross that passes for family films now. At least there is some artistry involved, and while he might not be at his best I'll still always pay to see a Tim Burton film (although I got this one for free...)"
1074,tt1014759,6,"Tim Burton film version of Lewis Carroll's classic proves the special slickness of director to create weird worlds and strange characters .

1075,tt1014759,5,"It is still worth the high price of the 3-D admission to see some of the amazing animation and design, but the writing is extremely boring and clumsy, and the performances cannot save it. Too many liberties were taken with the originals here, and in no way improve upon them, it only barely resembles either of Carroll's books in theme and some specific scenes. There are some ""Disney moments"" that literally set off a gag reflex as well.The animation is quite stunning and wonderful though, as is the costuming and set design (in so much as there were sets and not just green screens, I'm sure SOME actual props were used). There are some clever elements that owe only to good visual design and direction I'm sure, as the only other clever bits in the dialogue were the parts directly lifted from the originals."
1076,tt1014759,2,"I loved ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"" and remember it as an amazing and timeless adventure indeed. Alice wanders around in a world so enigmatic and unstable that you never know what will happen next, and what twist will put Alice in just new trouble, often unintentionally and tragically made worse by her own doing. Now this is all exactly what this movie does not have. After Alice arrives in the new 'underland', you will soon be in on the entire story: It is two sides, good against evil, and Alice is to slay a monster. Not a single second is unexpected. Nor are there any twists. (But even the first minutes are astonishingly wanting any concept: Scenes without any real characters rush by, there is no focus of attention in the opening.) But most of all, my understanding of then brand ""Alice"" is that she originally wanders around a dream land that confronts her with her own self, her anxieties, her shadowy anticipation that things will not be all nice and easy, all taking shape in landscapes, characters and events painted in dream-language. Of this essence, it should be no problem to create a movie that really leaves an impression - let alone, if Tim Burton is in the team. But there is nothing, nothing of this concept in this movie. Instead of joining a charismatic and mature character on the journey through her own dismal, natural instabilities that every one carries inside, the story here is already written, and Alice is only to follow marked footprints. For the only reason that... she is the one foretold to do it. There is merely the most silly 'hollywood-intellectualism', where 'good against evil' must be taken as, like, certainly some sort of metaphor representing all our everyday struggles, and it is so much about decision making and all... I'm devastated. Eventually, Tim Burton has added his potential for design to a movie completely without content. The only metaphor I see is Lewis Carroll appearing at the end in the figure of the Jabberwokie, and Alice, slaying him. Carroll is dead, long live 'Alice does Hollywood'."
1077,tt1014759,3,"Sometimes I think that I should like Tim Burton movies more than I do. Don't get me wrong, the man has made some excellent films, such as the masterful Ed Wood. But all too often, despite an agreeable tendency towards visual flamboyance, I leave his films feeling somewhat underwhelmed. Alice in Wonderland is a case in point. It's a movie where CGI effects rule the day. But the trouble is that the true weirdness that is at the heart of this story is not captured at all with all the computer-generated imagery on-screen. Sure it's very efficient and well-designed but like CGI in general, it's far too polished to really strike a chord and convince. There is a distinct lack of wonder in this Wonderland. The otherworldly weirdness is dissipated too by the use of overly-familiar voices to give life to the various denizens of this world, we are left thinking 'Oh that's Stephen Fry, hey isn't that Alan Rickman, I'm sure that's Christopher Lee and isn't that the bloke from Little Britain, etc'. It consistently takes us out of the movie and grounds the characters in a way that is just counter-productive. We want weirdness from an Alice in Wonderland film, not slick CGI and famous voice-over actors.There is also a dangerously cosy predictability at play here too. Tim Burton, Johnny Depp, Danny Elfman – they say familiarity breeds contempt, well that's a bit strong but it IS seriously lacking in surprises and you cannot help think that all three individually talented men could do with taking a break from each other for the good of their careers. Depp's Mad Hatter is pretty uninspired by his standards, while Burton's visuals and Elfman's music are nice but ultimately completely forgettable. I found it very difficult to care for any of the characters in this film, and that is never a good thing. It also meant that the conclusion came across as deeply trite, as we have been given nothing to empathize with. We don't know or have any interest in these characters, so when Alice goes around her extended family one by one imparting her new knowledge onto them, it means nothing. It also doesn't help that the journey to Wonderland has made absolutely no difference at all to the title character's state of mind – at the beginning she does not want to get married to the upper-class chump and at the end she does not want to get married to the upper-class chump. So you are left wondering what exactly was the point?I saw this in 3D and if there is one thing that this film has taught me it's that I am done with this 'new and improved' technology. I sensed it was a gimmick even before I watched Avatar; now I am certain. A bad film is a bad film, and no amount of extra visual depth is going to change that one iota. It's all surface-veneer, and really that's this movie's ultimate problem, there is nothing of interest within the CGI/3D. A great shame, as the source material is undeniably compelling.I realize that I am almost done here but I have not even mentioned the worst thing about the film. What was it? It was when the Mad Hatter and then, subsequently, Alice do a truly cringe-worthy little dance near the end of the film. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I half-expected Britain's Got Talent winners Diversity to pop up in a cameo appearance at this stage and join in with some urban street dancing manoeuvres. That didn't happen. And that is, at least, one saving grace."
1078,tt1014759,1,"Here is a tale of two Lewises. One wrote a small but great children's book that still delights, surprises and enchants. The other wrote a large, artistic series of children's books that push Christian sermons at us in the guise of adventure fantasy. The first author, Lewis Carroll, wrote Alice in Wonderland. The second, CS Lewis, wrote the Narnia saga. Here is what happened – in my theory – when the light bulb went on above the head of Linda Woolverton, who wrote the original screenplay for the new Alice in Wonderland.""What if we turn Wonderland into Narnia? What if an older Alice revisits her dream world, now called Underland, and discovers a giant battle in progress between good and evil? We could have a Red Queen's army fighting a White Queen's, a Mad Hatter as saintly mediator, and a lot of Armageddon spectacle sure to bring in the youngsters and spawn a video game.""Thus is Hell born. You cannot believe the dreadfulness of Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland – gifted director takes on gaga script – until you see it. Enchantment has gone that-away. Once down the rabbit hole Alice, played with brave but doomed grace by Australian actress Mia Wasikowska, discovers that her old chums all walk a darkening land bearing Tolkienish/Lewisite names. The dormouse is Mallymkun, the Cheshire cat Chessur, the caterpillar Absolem. Soon the throng is joined by dragons who seem to have come from Avatar. The tea party has 10 seconds to flatter us with incipient charm – its chaotic table and moth-eaten March Hare suggest a Samuel Beckett revamp (that would be a good spin) – before it too is sacrificed to sword, sorcery and showdown. Johnny Depp's Mad Hatter shows promise for a little longer – this actor does deranged innocence better than anyone (Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood) – but finally he too drowns in the Sea of Tacky Bombast."
1079,tt1014759,1,"I am shocked by both this movie and my visceral reaction to it. Unlike Avatar, which used the 3D technology as an integral part of the movie, 3D adds nothing to this movie. And frankly, the glasses darken the screen so much that the already dimmed image (thanks to projectors that aren't as bright as they used to be) was pretty bland. Let me state for the record, for anyone who doesn't know, the movie conflates the two books, and adds in Jabberwocky for the hell of it. And back story (19 year old Alice is about to marry the wrong man (she was too old for Lewis Carroll). The Queen of Hearts becomes the Red Queen. And the Knaves of Hearts become a cross between the clone robots for Star Wars:Clone Wars and sow bugs. 1. A bland, blond, Victorian Dorothy Gale lives in Kansas, er, England, and is about to marry a prig. She has recurring nightmares about Oz, er, Wonderland, er, Underland, and falls down the rabbit hole. Unlike The Wizard of Oz, there is really no sense of wonder when she opens the door from her black and white existence (filmed in color, which ruins the supposed effect) to Wonderland. Nor does Alice exhibit and curiosity or joy at being in Wonderland. The actress registers no emotion about anything. 2. Johnny Depp used to be a wonderful actor in quirky films. His movies now resemble the parodies that Carol Burnett used to do on her show. (Sweeney Todd being the exception). He has now ruined to wonderful movies, with a lot of help from Tim Burton: Charlie And The Chocolate Factory was excruciating in its twee-ness. And as with Alice, added too much back story and robbed the original Roald Dahl's original book of both its charm and character, while only emphasizing how amazing the original movie was. This movie adds all of the current techno bells and whistles and still can't compare to Disney's own animated version. 3. Tim Burton used to make interesting movies about interesting people with interesting actors: Ed Wood, Edward Scissorhands (what happened to that Johnny Depp?) More Sweeney, less fantasy, please.4. Why do Anne Hathaway's arms not straighten? What's up with that?EVerything that makes Lewis Carroll Lewis Carroll has been leached out of this movie."
1080,tt1014759,1,"It is amazing that they managed to make a remake that is worse than the original IN EVERY ASPECT. This film looks like a B movie, the animation, styling and scenery are flawlessly default and most of the movie visuals looks like the designers downloaded a pack of 3D stock models and colored them a bit. If you watch a showreel of almost ANY decent animation studio you will see much better and creative stuff than this.The direction is ridiculously non-interesting, some short shots are just plain stupid and I have no idea HOW is THIS possible in this budget. There is no rhythm, there are just a bunch of scenes with a little bit of this and a little bit of that. Sound editing is retarded with voices overlapping each other, atmospheric sounds are sometimes loud and sometimes non-existent. At the scene where the Mad Hatter gives a speech and makes a riot in Queen's castle the cheering crowd sound behind his speech is AWFUL! You can download better crowd samples FOR FREE.Music sounds like a bunch of sampled ""ooouuuooo"" shitty, spooky loops of crappy classical music in a default Burton way. Acting is WHATEVER and seems like everything was written and shot in 5 days. The voice dubbing of 3D models is worse than the earliest works of Dreamworks.There is no drama, there is no crescendo, there is no playfulness that makes Alice in WONDERLAND such a powerful story. There is not a shred of IMAGINATION here. I mean, even the opening credits look like they were done in 1 hour. To top it all, the song in the ending credits CANNOT be more cheap and that pathetic attempt of the final ""DANCE"" - some miserable version of a popping' breakdance is disgusting and is on the level of The Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers.Even on a ""woman becoming a powerful individual"" symbolism level the movie as bland as POSSIBLE.Holy ****, this movie is a humongous piece of an even more gigantic, moronic, generic feces that Hollywood is happily sitting in. Join the feast."
1081,tt1014759,6,"Adding a little bit of a background story and a few more characters to Alice's adventures didn't do as much as i thought it would for the story. Truthfully i wanted to love this movie, I'm a huge Tim Burton/ Johnny Depp fan. But this just didn't do it for me. I came out of the theater wondering if it were just the mediocre script or the director who had failed to meet my expectations. The best part of this movie is probably Johnny Depps portrayal of the mad hatter who truly is mad. However, Mia Wasikowska presents Alice in a dull manner that had me checking my watch every ten or fifteen minutes. Overall this film isn't awful, but at the same time its no masterpiece, for an interesting film to look at I suppose this would be an alright choice, however if you want a great story and compelling acting, you might want to check out something else, because this isn't the movie you're looking for."

1083,tt1014759,6,"I attended the Cast and Crew screening on Sunday, in Leicester Square, with high hopes for this film as it's without doubt the most exciting job I've had. This was my first feature experience, and working for Tim Burton was a hell of a way to start.But, even as someone with a lot of time for his films, and a pre-existing bias, I couldn't really connect with this. The cast acquit themselves well, especially considering the noted difficulty in emoting to a tennis ball on a stick, but all their tics and quirks seem to be masking a void at the centre of what should be a free-floating, evocative trip. Sure, it's weird looking, but we've seen it before, and back then in films like Edward Scissorhands it had a sense of purpose. Now we're left exploring a CGI wonderland that seems to be without a great deal of wonder. The book revels in its bizarre environs, absurd dialogue and whimsical characters. This film grounds them, drains them of that mystery and leaves us with a colourful but forgettable retread. It seems intent on driving us to a narrative conclusion that few people will have had much stake in through its running time, simply because we're not giving much to care for.With a source material so familiar, even to those whose knowledge is second hand references, there needs to be a degree of innovation (as in Svenkmejer's dark stop-motion version, or the co-opting of Terry Gilliam in to his ""Tideland"" narrative), or else a studious and inspired adaptation that completely returns to Lewis Carroll. What we end up with is a mid-point that fails to get to grips with what enchants people about the Alice story, and another chance to see a beautiful waif walk around twisted, quasi-Gothic landscapes to a score by Danny Elfman.Not that this isn't an enjoyable experience in itself, and as seen in the vast Screen 1 at the Empire it is at times breathtakingly pretty. It's just inessential, and while it may be unfair to expect a classic from a favoured filmmaker every time out, when they tackle something with the pedigree and history of Alice In Wonderland you can't help but hope for something special. And that's the problem, that Tim Burton, while he is still making decent films, has been a long way off special for some time now.6/10 (if they gave half stars it'd be 6.5), but that doesn't mean it's a bad film. It's possible that my grade is affected by high expectations and lost potential. If you have kids, I'm sure it'll be better than 90% of the dross that passes for family films now. At least there is some artistry involved, and while he might not be at his best I'll still always pay to see a Tim Burton film (although I got this one for free...)"
1084,tt1014759,6,"Tim Burton film version of Lewis Carroll's classic proves the special slickness of director to create weird worlds and strange characters .

1085,tt1014759,5,"It is still worth the high price of the 3-D admission to see some of the amazing animation and design, but the writing is extremely boring and clumsy, and the performances cannot save it. Too many liberties were taken with the originals here, and in no way improve upon them, it only barely resembles either of Carroll's books in theme and some specific scenes. There are some ""Disney moments"" that literally set off a gag reflex as well.The animation is quite stunning and wonderful though, as is the costuming and set design (in so much as there were sets and not just green screens, I'm sure SOME actual props were used). There are some clever elements that owe only to good visual design and direction I'm sure, as the only other clever bits in the dialogue were the parts directly lifted from the originals."
1086,tt1014759,2,"I loved ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"" and remember it as an amazing and timeless adventure indeed. Alice wanders around in a world so enigmatic and unstable that you never know what will happen next, and what twist will put Alice in just new trouble, often unintentionally and tragically made worse by her own doing. Now this is all exactly what this movie does not have. After Alice arrives in the new 'underland', you will soon be in on the entire story: It is two sides, good against evil, and Alice is to slay a monster. Not a single second is unexpected. Nor are there any twists. (But even the first minutes are astonishingly wanting any concept: Scenes without any real characters rush by, there is no focus of attention in the opening.) But most of all, my understanding of then brand ""Alice"" is that she originally wanders around a dream land that confronts her with her own self, her anxieties, her shadowy anticipation that things will not be all nice and easy, all taking shape in landscapes, characters and events painted in dream-language. Of this essence, it should be no problem to create a movie that really leaves an impression - let alone, if Tim Burton is in the team. But there is nothing, nothing of this concept in this movie. Instead of joining a charismatic and mature character on the journey through her own dismal, natural instabilities that every one carries inside, the story here is already written, and Alice is only to follow marked footprints. For the only reason that... she is the one foretold to do it. There is merely the most silly 'hollywood-intellectualism', where 'good against evil' must be taken as, like, certainly some sort of metaphor representing all our everyday struggles, and it is so much about decision making and all... I'm devastated. Eventually, Tim Burton has added his potential for design to a movie completely without content. The only metaphor I see is Lewis Carroll appearing at the end in the figure of the Jabberwokie, and Alice, slaying him. Carroll is dead, long live 'Alice does Hollywood'."
1087,tt1014759,3,"Sometimes I think that I should like Tim Burton movies more than I do. Don't get me wrong, the man has made some excellent films, such as the masterful Ed Wood. But all too often, despite an agreeable tendency towards visual flamboyance, I leave his films feeling somewhat underwhelmed. Alice in Wonderland is a case in point. It's a movie where CGI effects rule the day. But the trouble is that the true weirdness that is at the heart of this story is not captured at all with all the computer-generated imagery on-screen. Sure it's very efficient and well-designed but like CGI in general, it's far too polished to really strike a chord and convince. There is a distinct lack of wonder in this Wonderland. The otherworldly weirdness is dissipated too by the use of overly-familiar voices to give life to the various denizens of this world, we are left thinking 'Oh that's Stephen Fry, hey isn't that Alan Rickman, I'm sure that's Christopher Lee and isn't that the bloke from Little Britain, etc'. It consistently takes us out of the movie and grounds the characters in a way that is just counter-productive. We want weirdness from an Alice in Wonderland film, not slick CGI and famous voice-over actors.There is also a dangerously cosy predictability at play here too. Tim Burton, Johnny Depp, Danny Elfman – they say familiarity breeds contempt, well that's a bit strong but it IS seriously lacking in surprises and you cannot help think that all three individually talented men could do with taking a break from each other for the good of their careers. Depp's Mad Hatter is pretty uninspired by his standards, while Burton's visuals and Elfman's music are nice but ultimately completely forgettable. I found it very difficult to care for any of the characters in this film, and that is never a good thing. It also meant that the conclusion came across as deeply trite, as we have been given nothing to empathize with. We don't know or have any interest in these characters, so when Alice goes around her extended family one by one imparting her new knowledge onto them, it means nothing. It also doesn't help that the journey to Wonderland has made absolutely no difference at all to the title character's state of mind – at the beginning she does not want to get married to the upper-class chump and at the end she does not want to get married to the upper-class chump. So you are left wondering what exactly was the point?I saw this in 3D and if there is one thing that this film has taught me it's that I am done with this 'new and improved' technology. I sensed it was a gimmick even before I watched Avatar; now I am certain. A bad film is a bad film, and no amount of extra visual depth is going to change that one iota. It's all surface-veneer, and really that's this movie's ultimate problem, there is nothing of interest within the CGI/3D. A great shame, as the source material is undeniably compelling.I realize that I am almost done here but I have not even mentioned the worst thing about the film. What was it? It was when the Mad Hatter and then, subsequently, Alice do a truly cringe-worthy little dance near the end of the film. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I half-expected Britain's Got Talent winners Diversity to pop up in a cameo appearance at this stage and join in with some urban street dancing manoeuvres. That didn't happen. And that is, at least, one saving grace."
1088,tt1014759,1,"Here is a tale of two Lewises. One wrote a small but great children's book that still delights, surprises and enchants. The other wrote a large, artistic series of children's books that push Christian sermons at us in the guise of adventure fantasy. The first author, Lewis Carroll, wrote Alice in Wonderland. The second, CS Lewis, wrote the Narnia saga. Here is what happened – in my theory – when the light bulb went on above the head of Linda Woolverton, who wrote the original screenplay for the new Alice in Wonderland.""What if we turn Wonderland into Narnia? What if an older Alice revisits her dream world, now called Underland, and discovers a giant battle in progress between good and evil? We could have a Red Queen's army fighting a White Queen's, a Mad Hatter as saintly mediator, and a lot of Armageddon spectacle sure to bring in the youngsters and spawn a video game.""Thus is Hell born.

1094,tt0473075,7,"The common view amongst ""professional"" reviews is that the movie is average. scoring below 50% from Rotten Tomatoes, and MetaCritic, and notably a 2 out of 4 stars from Roger Ebert. The average user ranking on MC puts it at 9 out of 10.Most reviews range anywhere from 8 out of 10, to as low as 2 or 3 out of 10.If there's one thing critics can agree on, its that the movie is clichéd, borrowing elements from plenty of epics based in the Middle East and fantasy alike, and that it's loads of fun.The one thing no one can agree on is whether that's good or bad.It should be pointed out that this film is produced by the same company/studio that brought us 'Pirates of the Caribbean', and it certainly shows.With that said, I'll lead into my thoughts on the film. The first ""Pirates"" scored on average a 7.8 - 6.4 of 10, while the sequels averaged anywhere from 4.5 to 5.3. I'd say this movie is better than the sequels while not as good as the first. So, I'd give it roughly a 7 out of 10.The story is fun, for what it is. Which is a rough retelling of the video game ""Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time"", while incorporating elements of the following two sequels, as well as incorporating stylistic elements from the following game and the first three of the original trilogy. Thats right! Based loosely on one game, borrowing elements from SIX more. The movie is stretched too thin, and it shows.The movie feels like your prototypical ""sword and sandal"" action flick, borrowing heavily from films like ""The Thief of Baghdad"", and stories found in ""1001 Nights"". So think 'Arabian Nights', Ali Baba and the 40 Thieves, Aladdin, all mixed with some Steve Reeves 'Hercules' and Robert E. Howard 'Conan' flash.Is it as cheesy as that sounds? YES! Is it as awesome as that sounds? YES!But it's still well edited, well acted, well scored (Harry Gregson-Williams never fails), and overall well done enough to merit an enjoyable experience.The ONLY complaints I can think of are few, but here they are: A bit too much CGI, not on the stunts (not much CGI there surprisingly) but on things like demonic-esque snakes (you'll see). Too much random slow-motion. The sexual-tension seemed too forced (too many of those really slow ""they're about to kiss but don't"" moments). And whereas yes, the ending is supposed to have a ""Deus-Ex-Machina"" feel to it, in the game it is much more thorough and more explained, in the movie you're just expected to roll with it.Other than that. A fun night at the movies! Grab your over-priced candy, soda, and popcorn (or do like me and sneak snacks in) and have fun with friends, family and loved ones, recapturing the fun escapism of your childhood with an epic but cliché action movie.Hope you enjoyed my review...

As a fun of the game; the script wasn't entirely accurate just like most of the movies based on games but it didn't stray too far either. OK it was not the perfect movie but it was something that I would go and watch its sequel.Overall I enjoyed myself and I believe if you go open minded you will enjoy yourself too."
1096,tt0473075,9,"Tonight I was fortunate enough to see an advanced screening of this film. Like many, I became a fan of this franchise with the Sands of Time trilogy, and I was very excited when I learned that there were plans to make a feature film based on it. The storyline of the game is very cinematic (at least in the aforementioned trilogy, not necessarily in the previous games in the series) so I felt that at film adaptation would be an impressive epic.Having finally seen this movie, I can say that I was not at all disappointed!One of the main strengths going into this movie was it's involvement of the series creator Jordan Mechner. He crafted a very engaging screen story that pushed beyond the controller, creating an entirely new addition to the mythos. I know that at times including the creator can sometimes stifle the process, as many will fight changes to the source material that may need to be altered to work better with a director's vision; but I feel that Mechner's involvement showed his desire to see his brain-child develop into a success on the big screen.In addition to involving Mechner, the other big strength was the way that the filmmakers chose to handle the story. Let's face it, movies based on video games have a very poor track record. Super Mario Brothers, Street Fighter, Tomb Raider... all of them made for films that were mediocre at best, and downright abysmal at worst. Prince of Persia had a mighty big hurdle to clear with this, and they found the perfect team to tackle it. Jerry Bruckheimer and Disney already accomplished a similar feat when they brought Pirates of the Caribbean to the big screen (a movie based on a theme park ride, in a genre that had not seen success in 50 years!) Their strategy was the same, they wrote their own story that borrowed elements from the game, but did not strictly follow it. The film stands alone, and does not require it's audience to be intimately familiar with the source material. The nods to the game throughout were great, but I was relieved that I was able to enjoy this film for what it was, rather than constantly looking for where it deviated from the games.This movie clearly was made for someone like me, and in my party of four, three of us, who were all guys, loved it. The fourth, who was the only woman in the group, was less than impressed, and complained that it was too much action. If you're expecting Citizen Kane, you stand to be disappointed, but if you expect this to be another video game adaptation, you are in for a real treat!"
1097,tt0473075,8,"I was looking forward to this film because of the hype, and I was afraid to be disappointed. But as the film unfolded, I most definitely enjoyed this adventure from beginning to end.Jake Gyllenhaal plays the titular Prince of Persia, Dastan, who was an urchin picked by the King from the marketplace to be his third son. He and his brothers get caught in a web of political high jinx that cross their paths with Princess Tamina of Alamut (played by Gemma Arterton), and the fabled powers of the Sands of Time.This is Jake Gyllenhaal's most accessible film so far, and he goes to town with it. OK, granted he does not look the least bit Persian, or of that particular time period, but somehow his charisma was able to carry us on this fantastic ride. I also enjoyed his interaction with the beautiful Arterton, which sparks with humor and romance. She was my favorite part of ""Clash of the Titans (2010),"" and same here.I highly recommend this film for a good old-fashioned, action-adventure film set in ancient times. The parkour sequences are definitely of the highest order and very well-edited and photographed. The sets and visual effects are excellent. Best of all, the story is intelligent and well-constructed. Producer Jerry Bruckheimer has again delivered a very entertaining summer blockbuster. A very well-executed film of its genre. A must watch!"
1098,tt0473075,9,"Did you see Iron Man and Robin Hood? Yes? Well, this film is better, simply because the story is original. I know, I know, it is based on the computer game...which I used to play ages ago...but the story portrayed in the script is classic and refreshing at the same time; the performances are natural and the stunt scenes are unbelievable. Now, what did Iron Man 2 miss and this movie excels at? Plot, and a fast action pace without being over caffeinated big bang explosions (ever saw G.I. Joe?)Having said that, you must be warned, the dialogues are simple but not stupid and it does contain a fair amount of moral references.Sure everyone is crying out loud about the British accents... ""ohh but Persians didn't speak English"" yeah but this isn't The Passion of The Christ, or Apocalypto and Mel Gibson was nowhere near the production, Jake Gyllenhaal is an American, but the rest of the cast is British, makes sense they should all have a similar accent doesn't it?? So quit yer whining Overall a good wholesome fun summer movie. worth repeating!"
1099,tt0473075,9,"I didn't expect much from this movie, and wasn't planning on watching it after watching the trailer, which had somehow managed to butcher the action sequences which turned to be pretty good in the movie. It hardly depicted the movie for what it made out to be, so i'm more than glad that i did. At first glance Jake wouldn't be my first choice for the role of the prince as i didn't think he really looked the part, with his slightly goofy looking demeanor, but he made up for it as he certainly played the part(and thanks to the costume designer, dressed the part), coupled with a good body double the parkour wasn't far off either. There was good chemistry between the male and female leads, however, granted perhaps overplayed in less than idyllic moments for pda haha, which some might find cliché but hardly something to dwell on in this pretty awesome movie so its not as bad as other critics claim. It offers aesthetically pleasing graphics (as to be expected of the people who worked on the pirates of the Caribbean) and although deviated from the plot of the game, the important aspects blended well and made for an enjoyable, and not totally predictable storyline. Another epic jerry epic i say. I sincerely hope they make a sequel, especially if the the dark prince is involved in the storyline, that would be badass (magma cracks already showing on the prince's body during slow mo time travel scenes so fingers crossed)"
1100,tt0473075,9,"Prince of Persia was an immensely enjoyable movie. Below I list the positives and few negatives of the movie before summarising.Positives - What I liked about Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time~Its beautifulThe visuals in this movie are stunning. Everything from the cinematography of the desert landscapes to the city of Alamut and the beautiful sets are a real treat to look at.~The two leads are excellentThe chemistry between Gyllenhaal and Arterton is fantastic and they, like the visuals, are great to look at. Arterton is stunning as Princess Tamina and Gyllenhaal is as watchable as always. The supporting actors all do their jobs decently.~The fight choreography and parkourParkour is going to be the new big thing in movieland so I hear and its great to watch, really adding an exciting new element to the tried and tested swordfight ~The story wasn't actually totally predictableI haven't played the games so I didn't really know what I was in for with the plot, only that it involved some sands of time... Call me a moron but I actually found quite a lot of what happened in the movie very unpredictable and the ending of the movie for me was totally unexpected.Negatives- What could have been better~Historical inaccuracyI thought the movie was meant to be in Sassanid Persia (3rd-7th century AD) but the map at the beginning clearly showed Achaemenid Persia which was quite confusing so the inclusion of crossbows and the mention of the ""Turkish"" was quite out of place. The Mughuls are also mentioned which is out of place regardless since they Mughuls were Mongols... The movie does include a dagger which can turn back time so perhaps the whole point of moot but I don't feel some more research would have hurt.~Could have been funnierThe movie could have been a little funnier but the storyline moved at such a pace that there wasn't much chance for much hijinks. There were some funny lines in there however and as I mentioned before, the chemistry between Arteron and Gyllenhaal was very enjoyable##Conclusion##Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is not the type of movie that comes along often. How often do you really get to see a beautifully shot film set in Ancient Persia featuring such good leads and original story? It was an enjoyable movie and a great movie in its own right I say, bring on the sequels - just don't mess them up like Pirates of the Caribbean."
1101,tt0473075,8,"I've never played the Prince of Persia games, but this movie wants me to try one of the games. The movie is very good and the visuals are stunning."
1102,tt0473075,8,"It isn't often that a video game is so vivid, so involving...so enveloping, that it is looked on as a possible movie franchise on all those merits. Usually, just the action (Doom, Final Fantasy), or just the body (Lara Croft...Tomb Raider) or just some other one aspect makes for a great game, but an underwhelming movie. I had the pleasure of watching this movie in an early screening on Monday night, and it is definitely a step above and beyond the aforementioned videogames-turned-movies.The hallmark from the very beginning of the Prince of Persia franchise (a primitive DOS programmed, side-scrolling adventure through a castle to rescue a locked-up princess) was not only having a great story, but telling it in such a way to keep the player in that world. This film, surprisingly enough, doesn't play out quite as closely to the video games as I had expected. Still, without spoiling either the games or this movie, I can say that it shows Jordan Mechner had full involvement in the movie. Many storytelling elements present in the ""Prince of Peria: The Sands of Time"" video game can be found here, and made for a very entertaining romp through the vast lands of Persia.I would say that my main gripe is the under-use of parkour, the running/fighting style the Prince deploys in the video games. This is a hard gripe to substantiate though, because of how difficult parkour is to execute, let alone master, nonetheless I had expected something resembling the wall-running, banner-ripping moves seen in the ""Sands of Time"" video game trilogy. It's harder still to be too down on a little parkour, due to Disney's desire that this film would be the first in a Prince of Persia movie franchise, equal to or greater than the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movie franchise. Therefore, I await with anticipation the creativity that more parkour would bring to the stories this most agile Prince can tell.""Prince of Peria: The Sands of Time"" gets 8 of 10 stars."
1103,tt0435761,1,"I attended a special screening for Toy Story 3. I went in with HIGH expectations. I LOVED the first two Toy Stories movies. Toy Story is a beloved franchise that almost everyone that I know loves the first two films. Now how about the 3rd film? Well all I could say is that it lived up to my unbelievably HIGH expectations and then some. This is such a good film. It has the laughs, magic and best of all the entertainment. The new characters in the movie feel like they were in the previous two films, they were that engaging and really worked well in the movie. The best part of the movie has to be the ending, I almost cried and was moved to just about to tears. I truly believe that this is one of the best Trilogies of all time. It might even rival the Lord of the Rings Trilogy.This movie has a real chance to become the First Animated Film to win Best Picture. I surely would not be surprised.10/10 An Amazing End to a Fantastic Series Go Watch It"
1104,tt0435761,1,"Lee Unkrinch directed ""Toy Story 3,"" the third and presumably final installment in the ""Toy Story"" movie franchise. One could argue that this is probably the best one yet (1999's ""Toy Story 2"" remains my personal favorite of the three), and I won't argue with those who think otherwise. I still hold onto ""Toy Story 2"" for deep personal reasons, but ""Toy Story 3"" does build upon events foreshadowed in the previous installment, which does gives this film a weighty emotional punch - a rarity in animated films these days.As foreshadowed in ""Toy Story 2,"" Andy (John Morris) has finally grown up; he's 17 now, and is on his way to college in just a few days. His mom is putting pressure on him to get rid of his old toys, either by throwing them out with the garbage, donating them to other needy children, or simply putting them in the attic (a sort of gone-but-not-forgotten-and-within-reach-type of deal).Woody (Tom Hanks), brave leader of the toys and Andy's favorite, manages to dodge a bullet somewhat, but puts himself in the line of fire when Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) and the other toys are accidentally thrown out but somehow or another wind up at Sunnyside Daycare, where they are welcomed with open arms by the resident toys there. This introduces us to Lotso (Ned Beatty), the strawberry-scented teddy bear who runs the place, along with the metro-sexual Ken doll (Michael Keaton) and others. As it turns out, this daycare center is actually a prison, and Lotso runs this place with an iron fist; of course, Lotso has a very tragic back-story that explains his evil ways, much like with Jessie (Joan Cusack), who first appeared in ""Toy Story 2."" So Woody and the other toys must mount a valiant escape if they are to be reunited with their beloved owner before he leaves for college.""Toy Story 3"" is an amazing film, and a fitting end to a wonderful film series that started in 1995 with the first ""Toy Story,"" which also signaled the arrival of the very illustrious and extremely talented Disney-owned animation studio Pixar. They have yet another significant hit on their hands with this picture. The animation here is at its most life-like and real and it's damn-near flawless and strikingly beautiful, which signals just how far Pixar has come in the 15 years since their first hit with ""Toy Story."" And every film since then has added significant amounts of realism, weight, and dimension to their animated stories.While ""Toy Story 2"" had a high nostalgia factor for days long gone by, ""Toy Story 3"" is a film about the inevitability of children growing up and putting away their toys. There are also themes about the effect of loss, love, and friendship going in the proceedings here. In addition, ""Toy Story 3"" can also be an incredibly dark film at times - a bold move considering that this is a family film - but there's no need to worry because the fact is that it's all perfectly balanced out amazingly well with some very light-hearted humor, fast and furious action scenes, and stirring emotional moments that just might bring a few tears to your eyes.""Toy Story 3"" is a triumph of animation and imagination, and I say that as a die-hard ""Toy Story 2"" fan. What we get here, is a fitting closer (?) to an amazing film series that just continues to surprise again and again with each new entry. It's just a great reminder for all of us heartless adults of better days in our youth that have long gone bye-bye.10/10"
1105,tt0435761,1,"The best magic tricks in the world are ones that cannot be unraveled, reverse engineered or dissected to figure out exactly how they are pulled off. This philosophy is doubly applicable to Pixar's ""Toy Story 3"", the storyline-ending outro of the beloved Toy Story, uh, story.I feel it relevant somehow to divulge my age, as it somehow validates the powerful emotions evoked throughout the film. I am a 28 year old male, who, fifteen years ago, was fresh into the teen years of supposed adolescence at the release of some weird, 3d animated movie (wait, they can animate with computers?) entitled ""Toy Story"". This was a pretty bold move, a calculated stroll to the edge of the cliff and a daring leap off into the thin air of creativity and innovation. And it was a hit, ensuring 3d animation a place right alongside (more or less) 2d animation. And naturally, Pixar would be at the forefront, leading the cavalry charge of digital animation ranging from great to gawd-awful.""Toy Story 3"" starts off as comfortably as possible, with our friends Woody and Buzz Lightyear doing what they do the best...playing with Andy in his world of make-believe adventure. We are then treated to some familiar Pixar progression, like abandonment, solidarity, coming back to friends, and the passing of the torch. Clearly, in the eleven years between this point and when ""Toy Story 2"" wrapped, a computer revolution or four has occurred, allowing a world of unsurpassed clarity, reality and imagination to shine through like never before. TS1's spark is TS2's candle, and that in turn is TS3's blazing sun.Roll the last fifteen minutes of film. It became clearly obvious that the figurative tables have been turned, because a good number of the adults in the audience (including myself) were sniffling and teary-eyed, while the kids were looking up, likely thinking ""jeez mom and dad, they're just toys, get over it"".Wasn't it conventional wisdom that just the kids get emotional over losing plastic playthings? With ""Toy Story 3"", Pixar has shown us one of the greatest magic tricks in modern showbiz history, likely not to be outdone or duplicated, that we all have very real and deep connections to our childhoods and to the things and people that allowed us as kids to be free, and innocent, and pure, and most importantly, to dream. This, to me, is a life lesson worth remembering, to infinity and beyond.""Toy Story 3"" gets 10 of 10 blazing stars"
1106,tt0435761,1,Toy Story 3 in my opinion is by far the best of the trilogy! It is the most emotionally investing out of all the Toy Story installments and is an outstanding entry to the Pixar library!
1107,tt0963966,8,"The same people who to me are surprisingly rudely negative about this film would probably say I'm too easily pleased, but I enjoy movies as escapism for the most part and see no need to pick this very enjoyable vehicle to death. Actually, some early negatives I'd read had me worried that I would be irritated I spent the money, instead I've already decided to buy this when it comes out.Overall, I'd say if you like romping easy movies like The Mummy, National Treasure, and Lake Placid you'll like this, plus refreshingly (without being sickeningly sweet) there is not one swear word or sexed-up scene, so take the older kids and Grandma. I thought Nicolas Cage was excellent, he looked great and can wear a leather duster better than most, and there was some nice chemistry between Cage and Baruchel. Alred Molina looked like he was having fun and is such an enjoyable villain. Baruchel does a good job - he is so geeky at times it is a tad painful - and I found myself rooting for him. The 2 main female characters are lovely and appealing personalities.More pluses: A lively pace and I never lost interest plus a fair number of laughs. Some interesting character twists with the oily young rock-star magician helping Molina, and some very funny cheeky nods to the original animated Fanatasia - watch for the nod to Star Wars. Great and interesting special effects that made sense when they were used. Even the way the actors moved when they were doing magic was very good (for some reason the wand-waving in Harry Potter sometimes reminds me of people using a flyswatter or shaking a bug off a stick, that didn't happen in this film).So no, this isn't some classic of cinema, it is what it is and is a bit thin here and there, but it's also quite good for a ""magical romp"" and is in no way a bad film or a waste of money. I could have done without the occasional background songs which seemed designed to emphasize romantic angst or appeal to young teenagers, but that was bearable. I saw this at an early evening show and there were not many people in the theater, but we all laughed and there was applause at the end, and we left the theater smiling. Personally I think the critics panning this are full of BS or are trying to prove what intellectuals they are. In the meantime see this with your family or take your friends, and then go out and get some ice cream and sit outside and enjoy summer. Hope they make a sequel, too."
1108,tt0963966,8,"Dueling sorcerers, a compelling back-story, top-notch acting talent, and the Disney brand bring the idea born of Fantasia's Sorcerer's Apprentice to the big screen in a live full movie adaptation. While this film did not fully live up to its potential, it is a fun movie which will find its way into the collection.This is silly and sappy just like any other live action Disney movie, and if allowed, will worm its way into the heart in a disingenuous way. If you view this film expecting Casablanca or the Godfather, you WILL be unimpressed. But if you go in expecting to be entertained, you shouldn't be disappointed.The action sequences between Cage and Molina aren't elevated as much as many would expect, due to the story centering around the kid's battle, not Balthazar's. This is another standard Disney formula wherein the kid is undeserving, unprepared, and uneducated in the ways of the Samurai but is thrust into the center of the fray, regardless. Those who would rail against this formula, obviously weren't there to see a Disney movie.All in all? The five of us ranging in age from 45 to 15, loved it. It is clever, and creative, marrying the science of magic known by today's standards with the arcane stories of our past. I found it intriguing and adventurous enough not to be preachy, while still managing to educate even the most unwilling movie goer.It rates an 8.4/10 from...the Fiend :."
1109,tt0963966,8,"Jay B. is funny and charming in a believably nerdy fashion; Cage is at his quirky but charismatic best; the effects are plentiful and top notch; there's both a tragic love story and a young cute one plus a healthy dose of clever references to Disney's epic Fantasia (from which this film is partially inspired). If you read this list of attributes and it caught your interest and like the idea of centuries old sorcerers doing battle across New York in spectacular fashion then it wont matter what any other review says, you're going to want to check this flick out. It's funny, the cast is likable and there's a freaking dragon tearing up Chinatown (and that isn't even the finale!). On the other hand if all of this made you cringe, well nothing is going to persuade you to see it either. The truth is SORCERER'S APPRENTICE is fairly predictable, and the opening few minutes suffer a great deal from a completely distracting (and not needed) bit of narration but it is also solid matinée fun that I know I (and apparently the theater of folks I saw it with) really enjoyed."
1110,tt0963966,7,"Overall, this is entertaining and well done. The effects are not revolutionary but at least fit in to the story rather than detract from it. No violence or mayhem - its OK for a younger to general audience. Main fault is the hero Dave played by Jay Baruchel isn't up to the part.The script is pleasant if predictable - does the nerd hero rise to the task and vanquish the evil forces. There could have been more historical witches besides Abigail Williams of Salem. There are some humorous bits but not too many.Acting is better than expected. Nicholas Cage is quite good more serious and less horsey than usual. Monica looks a little older and has too little screen time. Alfred Molina is convincing without being annoying. Alice Krige (Morgana) is good and looks young. Teresa Palmer (Becky) the girlfriend acts and looks like a blonde Kristen Stewart.The main problem is Jay Baruchel (Dave) is a too geeky to the point of spastic sometimes. It is painful to watch him. He lacks charm and charisma nerdy or otherwise. He is not a cute geek. He speaks like he has a speech impediment. Would have been better with someone more like Shia Labeouf, Justin Long or Michael Angarano if they wanted one of the new nerd/geek heroes."
1111,tt0963966,9,"The kids & I were trying kill some time while Mom had a baking party at the house so we went to this with zero expectations. I was very pleasantly surprised. Nicolas Cage does a great job at the sorcerer who is looking for the ""Prime Merlinian"". He is the sorcerer who will inherit Merlin's powers. Our hero (David) is of course that person. The fun is in Cage's ability to be annoyed with the kid and like him at the same time. The CGI is enough to enhance the story but not overwhelm it. All four of my kids (ages 4-11) liked it. Some parts might be a little scary but not too bad (a dragon clomping around is all). Fun family flick.PS I also liked that the hero held a door for a girl. I pointed that out to my boys who need to learn that."
1112,tt0963966,8,"Believe it or not, this is actually a pretty good movie. I was annoyed with a few aspects of the movie such as my extreme annoyance with Jay Baruchel. But I think Nic Cage carried the movie. He is a very talented actor and he proves it in each movie he's in whether it's good or bad.This is about wizard named Balthazar who lives in modern day New York City. He has been searching for many centuries for the perfect kid who would be finally be his apprentice. He finally meets that kid and he trains him to be the one to save the world.The acting is pretty good. Of course Nic Cage is more than good. I was also impressed at Alfred Molina. Jay Baruchel is very annoying here. I just wanted to punch him in the face.People compare this movie for some reason to Harry Potter. I'll say now that this is no Potter. This film is no masterpiece like the Potter series but it still is good.Overall, this is a pretty good family movie. I would turn a deaf ear to the critics and watch this. I rate this film 8/10."
1113,tt0963966,7,"What film, filled with fantasy, magic AND physics, mild horror, adventure, humour, great action and special effects? Why it's Disney's The Sorcerer's Apprentice of course. Starring Nicolas Cage and hometown (Montreal/Canadian) boy Jay Baruchel.""The Sorcercer's Apprentice"" made its Canadian debut on Thursday July 8th, as the opening film feature at the commencement of the 14th edition of the Montreal Fantasia Film Festival, hosted, as it has been for the past several years by Concordia University.In one of the venue's largest theaters, about 700 of us were treated to the screening of said film, in advance of its opening next Wednesday, July 14th.And what a treat it was.After the general Festival opening announcements, Jay Baruchel (who was in attendance) introduced the film to the happy hometown audience. Then we sat back and allowed the magic to unfold.Without giving too much (or anything) away, I can safely say that The Sorcercer's Apprentice was indeed an enjoyable film.Nic Cage made good as the ""just a bit"" crazy master sorcerer Balthazar Blake, on the quest to find the one who could be the next to acquire Merlin's magic and defeat the evil Morgana.And Baruchel proved to be well cast as the nerdy, endearing, reluctant hero / apprentice.With a nice, balanced blend of action, adventure and pretty cool special effects. The film takes the viewer on a fun ride, reminiscent of classic Disney fun family fare. And it'd also no doubt leave you laughing out loud at some unexpected moments in dialogue.If you enjoyed The National Treasure movies, then you will certainly enjoy The Sorcerer's Apprentice."
1114,tt0963966,8,"First I should start off saying I love all Jerry Bruckheimer productions, with the exception of CSI: Miami, but that is more David Caruso then the show. I also feel I should admit that I was excited about this movie since I first saw the previews.That being said I felt the movie was very well put together in some ways not so much in others. I never read reviews until after I see a movie to be able to make my own ideas about it. Then I check to see it I'm in the minority. I'm shocked to say in this film I was. I felt that Nicholas Cage and Jay Baruchel did very well with the parts they were given. I do wish they had more screen time to gel a little better. Alfred Molina as usual does a wonderful job as the evil villain, but I wish his apprentice Toby Kebbell got more screen time. Some of the love story plot could have been given up for more magic scenes. I felt that Dave and Becky didn't really need all that screen time. I feel the movie is geared toward a younger audiences so to compare it to Inception is unfair no 10 year old is going to get that plot what so ever. Yes it was very predictable to me but not to my 5 year old sitting next to me. I went in expecting a well acted, predictable, easy plot, with some things that would make me chuckle, And that's exactly what I got.Overall the plot was easily understandable, the actions a little predictable, and the chemistry a little off with some of the characters. However give it a break I'm 23 and a mother of 4, and with all the children's movies I have seen this summer this is one I will actually buy when it come to DVD.Also I just have to say I love the main song Secrets by Onerepublic I have had it stuck in my head since I left the theater!"
1115,tt0963966,6,"Amusing film is packed with intrigue , comedy , tense and especial effects galore , dealing with a Master sorcerer named Balthazar Blake who recruits a seemingly everyday guy in his mission to defend New York City from his arch-nemesis, Maxim Horvath . It starts in 740 A.D., in Britain, the disciple of Merlin Maxim Horvath (Alfred Molina) unites forces to the wicked Morgana Le Fay (Alice Krige) and betrays his master. However, the other two disciples of Merlin Balthazar Blake (Nicolas Cage), a descendant from a historical line familiar whose mission was defeat nasty witch and Veronica (Monica Belluci) defeat the evil and Balthazar catches Horvath in a magic recipient and Veronica merges with Morgana and they are seized in another vessel. Along the centuries, Balthazar unsuccessfully seeks out the Prime Merlian, the only sorcerer capable to destroy Morgana, using a dragon ring and he finally finds him in the present days in Manhattan . Balthazar can't do it alone, so he enlists Dave Stutler (Jay Baruchel), a seemingly average guy who demonstrates hidden potential, as his reluctant pupil. The sorcerer gives his unwilling accomplice a crash course in the art and science of magic, and together, these unlikely partners work to stop the forces of darkness. It'll take all the courage Dave can muster to survive his training, save the city and get the girl as he becomes The Sorcerer's Apprentice. The young is spontaneously implicated as key on find out the weird events .However the sorcerer's apprentice is in love with Becky Barnes (Teresa Palmer) and Blake doubts whether he is actually the chosen one .They will take on lots of adventures, risks and confronting a stubborn enemy. The sorcerer and his new friend undergo a chase that take them throughout the N.Y. streets .This entertaining movie displays suspense , noisy action, intrigue, humor and extraordinary adventures. The picture blends rip-roaring feats , thrills , mystery and witchery , along with a Walt Disney style . It's a cinematic roller coaster pretty amusing that have you on the edge of your seat. The tale is silly and laughable but the effects and action are quite well. Among the most spectacular of its visuals there are a metallic eagle , the attack of a sculpture showing a giant bull brought to life and other monsters roaring menacingly towards the camera. Some illogical parts in the argument are more than compensated for the excitement provided by the excellent visual effects by John Nelson . Stimulating action set pieces illuminate the full-blown adventures of ours protagonists with breathtaking final attraction in the scenes of the ultimate confrontation among wizards . Stirring and lively musical score by Trevor Rabin . Cameraman Bojan Bazelli makes a glamorous cinematography though mostly night. The flick is lavishly produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and professionally directed by John Turteltaub (the kid , Phenomenon, While you were sleeping) .Both of them have collaborated in two hits as ¨National treasure¨ and ¨National treasure : Book of secrets¨ . The picture will appeal to Nicolas Cage fans and Jerry Brukheimer movies enthusiasts."
1116,tt0963966,6,"This Disney movie is fun and the effects are first grade.Nicolas Cage is good as expected. Same goes to Alfred Molina and it's always nice to see Monica Bellucci.BUT, there is one BIG problem and that is Jay Baruchel. Why, o why, they had to put him into this movie? He ruined it completely with his annoying appearance, voice and, above all, irritating not-at-all-talented acting. They should have find different actor for this role. I don't have someone in mind but this one is very wrong. Without him it would be a much better movie.But, it's still entertaining, in spite of occasional not funny jokes which are forced into scenario. The story is bearable and neat effects pulls it out of average, slightly."
1117,tt0902967,1,"I saw ""The Crimson Wing"" a few years ago, it was the first Disneynature documentary I had seen. I never thought Flamingos could be as beautiful as presented in this film. The filmmakers and cinematographer's did a great job getting the shots of these wild animals.In the film, it explains how mankind has been devastating to the ecosystem and the habitats of flamingos. The BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico a few years back destroyed a lot of their natural habitat.You get to see the life-cycle of these amazing birds, from birth to death. This is a true educational experience. The quality is great, and it's a film the whole family can watch together."
1118,tt0902967,8,"This is the first of a new generation of nature documentaries from Disney and they picked a VERY difficult topic to cover. Instead of the usual locations like jungles or plains, this one is filmed in the most hellish place in Tanzania--near the Kenyan border in a region made toxic to most life by volcanic ash. However, surprisingly, 2.5 million flamingos return to Lake Natron each year- -despite it having a pH of 10.5 and being made up of a mixture of ash and salt. The film follows the flamingos for a year--as the return to do their courtship rituals, lay and hatch eggs and then grow into adulthood. It's all quite lovely with nice cinematography yet Disney chose not to release this to theaters--though it would have been lovely to see on the giant screen. My only reservations are that kids might be a bit shook up because nature is pitiless and you see a lot of flamingos die. Also, biologists might dislike how the narration often becomes much too prosaic and not exactly scientific. Still, the overall effect is breathtaking and if you see it, try to see it on as large a TV as possible."
1119,tt0902967,7,"Known simply as 'The Crimson Wing' here in the UK, I remember it causing a bit of a stir when it was released just over a year ago. Of course it all died down pretty quickly and the film didn't pick up any major awards. Needless to say it caught my attention and so when it turned up on TV I decided to give it a viewing.This documentary tells the story of Lake Natron in northern Tanzania and how every year, after the rains come, a massive flock of Lesser Flamingos comes to the lake to breed. It tells of all the trials and tribulations of the young chicks, of all the dangers they must survive and, yes, there are scenes depicting the fates of those that don't. We are also told about some of the wildlife surrounding the lake and how it gives the flamingos their unique crimson plumage.A great score and some superb cinematography give this film the edge over other nature documentaries I've seen. There is also a great narration delivered by British TV presenter, Mariella Frostrup which only added to my enjoyment.It did tend to sag a bit towards the end, but overall quite an enjoyable and informative film. I wouldn't recommend it for the very young, but I think for anyone interested in wildlife its well worth a viewing. Over all, recommended.My score: 6.8/10"
1120,tt0902967,7,"For me, Crimson Wing was a somewhat sad and tragic story that showed me very clearly what hardships the flamingos had to go through in order to preserve their species.Filmed almost entirely at Lake Natron in Tanzania, not only did the adult flamingos have to protect their new-born chicks from such ravenous beasts as the mongoose, but the vast salt deposits that accumulate around Lake Natron posed an equally treacherous threat for the survival of the struggling young, as well.Crimson Wing was a ""Disney-Nature"" presentation. Not only was it impressively photographed and its narration by Mariella Frostrup informative, but its musical score by Le Cinematic Orchestra set the mood of this documentary's story very nicely.Yes. I certainly do recommend Crimson Wing to all who are curious about the diversity of the natural world that exists in abundance all across this planet we call ""ours'."
1121,tt0902967,7,"Well, I must say that I was really quite impressed with this ""Disneynature"" documentary that took an in-depth look at the flamingos of Africa who (once a year) arrive by the 1000s at Lake Natron (in Tanzania) in order to mate and raise their young.In part, this thoughtful documentary was, without question, a very sad tale from the viewpoint of the survival of the flamingo chicks who must quickly gather their strength in order to endure the hardships that immediately come before them and challenge their very existence.With its excellent photography and its equally superb soundtrack music (from The Cinematic Orchestra), I certainly recommend this DVD very highly to those of you who are interested in witnessing such an amazing phenomenon like this one from the world of nature where many astounding marvels are there for us to behold."
1122,tt0902967,9,"A story told in a simple, friendly, inspiring way. The music score is one of the best soundtracks ever written (considering scores for cinema, TV and video games) and adds to the overall experience this film creates - in a way one might say that it even defines this movie and sets the standard for other future productions.The director's view of a story (a circle of life in a way) is also a highlight for this documentary as it unfolds, expands and then sets itself in a clear, well define perspective of what life is, what colour is and how we, as the birds, are defined by these elements.A fluid, well described and narrated documentary like only a few. Watch it, even if you only do so for the score and the integration of the score to the cinematography."
1123,tt0902967,6,"Basically this ""Disney"" movie is an ""Animal Planet"" documentary shot with more sophisticated equipment and in better picture quality.It shows the first vital periods of flamingos' life since hatching from an egg in a remote African area. There are many interesting shots capturing these birds as they struggle to survive the odds, but after some time it gets repetitive and boring.The narrator was rather annoying as well, making childish comparisons and talking about fairy tales, whereas I would have appreciated more given data and the scientific approach.Therefore, nothing groundbreaking or faint-inducing."
1124,tt0902967,6,"I saw this as part of the New York International Children's Film Festival weekly screenings at the IFC Center in Manhattan. The blurbs they had posted on their website and the link to the trailer made this seem like it was something I would love to see.The film follows a year in the life of the flamingos from their birth in a the middle of the inhospitable lake Natron, which is so full of salt nothing can live there, through their growing up to the point where they can leave and then back to their return to the lake the next year. Actually most of the film is on their time at Natron with the chicks struggling to live.A visually stunning film, this movie is so full of fantastic images it will have your mouth hanging open and tears rolling down your cheeks. Its a stunningly beautiful film at times and it was a treat to see the images on a huge movie screen.The film is also very heart breaking. The film does not shy away from showing the young (and not so young) birds as they meet their doom either at the hands of the predators, who wade in and take their fill, or from the salt shackles that form around the legs of some of the chicks which make their getting around slow or even impossible. If the film doesn't have a regular US release, which it appears not to, I'm guessing its because the heart breaking scenes of the death of the chicks have given Disney pause as to how to market the film to families.For me the flaw of the film is that as it stands now its too long by a good fifteen or twenty minutes. Once the chicks begin to mature and head off to the various lakes around Africa the film kind of has nowhere to go (actually once the birds get off the salt islands the film slows). The filmmakers don't follow the birds much and outside of the narration that ""they go where they will"" and some flying sequences, we see little. Then, magically, a year has passed and the birds return again. The film is essentially repeating itself (Even the narration repeats itself)and it suddenly seems to have no point other than to show this one piece of the life of the flamingos. Don't get me wrong its not a bad film, Its just that its one that's been stretched to 75 minutes to make the minimum length required for a feature film.I like it its worth seeing, just be wary if you bring the kids since some of the sequences with doomed chicks may upset some of the children in your brood (A couple of kids in the theater were desperate to be reassured by mommy and daddy) The first 50 minutes is 8 out of 10, the second half less, with the over all petering out making the film less then it really should be."
1125,tt0902967,7,"Crimson Wing is a documentary based on the lives of some flamingo chicks throughout their birth to young adulthood  Filmed mainly around Lake Natron in Northern Tanzania.Finely narrated by Zabou Breiman, with some fantastic wildlife photography and a really moving music score this film gets inside the adventures experienced over the period of a year – showing seasonal changes – births, deaths, trials and tribulations of the young birds and their weird and wonderful habitats – especially interesting are the strange ""salt islands"" that the flamingo's use for nesting and rearing their young.Many of the audience were engrossed by this film  and many of the children especially seemed to ""adopt"" and be entranced by the story and the chicks and were genuinely concerned for the birds well-being.A fascinating bird's eye view into the lives of flamingo's  if you didn't like or know much about these birds before – then you'll grow to be fascinated by them from watching this well crafted documentary, superb, high-quality photography, beautiful landscapes and a stirring musical score.Recommended for lovers of nature documentaries everywhere."
1126,tt0902967,1,"My girlfriend and I purchased this movie because she really likes flamingos and we figured a Disney movie has to be happy. Wrong! The movie really focused a lot on baby flamingos being caught in ""salt shackles"" and subsequently dying. Then it randomly showed spider webs and (non-flamingo) birds for a full 60 seconds. Eventually, it returned to showing flamingos, primarily dead ones, making their way against adversity. I can't even say, however, that this was an inspiring film that showed the power of perseverance or anything like that. It really just showed a lot of dead flamingos. My girlfriend and I had read a lot of different reviews and thought that all the people online who said things like I'm saying now were just kooks or trolls or something. Wrong! So please, if you like flamingos and don't want to see them die, then please avoid this movie at all costs. (On the other hand, if you hate flamingos and want to see them die, then this movie is right up your alley and by all means, the $10 or whatever that it costs will be well worth it to you.)"
1127,tt1028576,7,"My grandmother was a parent during the '50's and liked everything neat and clean and in its place. Heaven forbid if things get too out of hand; too ""real"". I have waited my entire life for Hollywood to tell Secretariat's story and after watching Disney's Secretariat my heart remains unsatisfied. It was a good, ""feel good"" movie, but ""good"" is the keyword. I felt like Grandma edited this movie. Again, it is a good movie with some interjections of great cinematography, yet Secretariat was a GREAT horse and deserved a GREAT movie. This was an Oscar winning story, with an Oscar winning cast, but the script was emotionally impotent. There were no risks and risk is what horse racing is all about. The movie is so safe and there wasn't anything safe about the facts that surround this horse and his rise to be the greatest race horse that ever lived.Still today, when I watch Secretariat run on YouTube, I cry!!! I'm not sure why, but the tears flow from the depths of my being. Rationally, I try to tell myself that he is just a horse, but something overcomes me every time, no matter how many times I watch him run. That overwhelming surge of emotion is what this story deserved. If you've ever been in the presence of a great horse, you will know what I am talking about. They are strong and confident. You can feel their aura. There is a low rolling thunder of excitement when you are near them. Talk to the people who were there. Read the first hand accounts of their emotional state when they saw this horse run. He was mesmerizing, captivating, unexplainably breathtaking. The audience deserved to feel the thunder roll through them in every scene.I expected so much more from director Randall Wallace. The power and emotion of Braveheart, We Were Soldiers, Pearl Harbor, The Man in the Iron Mask, is what Secretariat deserves. Where was that? I'm not sure what research he did for this movie and how much his hands were tied by the real life characters or the studio, but the main character became the background and what was in the forefront was a ""sugar coated"" conflict of a woman with a driving passion and the place society and her family was trying to lock her into; however, even her passion didn't spill out onto the audience as it should have. I felt like the accomplishments of Penny Chenery and Secretariat have been shrunk down and placed into a nice, neat little box fit for a good little housewife and her sweet little horse. I felt as if I was the one being squelched, because I wanted so badly for everyone to share the emotion I feel at the sheer audaciousness when this horse ran. To accomplish what they accomplished, he and his owner had to be completely audacious to rise above the negativity and overwhelming odds surrounding them.Diane Lane is one of my favorite actresses; however, her role left me doubting the character. For example, when a woman talks to her horse, she does more than look into his eye for a few seconds and say, ""Well OK then"". When a woman truly needs to know something from her horse she breathes him in, they breathe each other in, as their souls entwine and one knows the other. You will see it on his face and you will see it on her face, without human words being spoken. This is a rare and special event, but it happens, and it could have carried this movie. If you have seen Diane Lane in ""Unfaithful"" you will realize this is an actress that could translate this kind of communication and emotion to the screen.The audience should have been allowed to feel the emotional range that surrounds all involved in preparing a horse for the greatest races any thoroughbred will ever run. Just watch horse racing on television and you will see real raw emotion that these people explode with at the end of the race. So much was on the line for everyone involved and yet throughout the movie everyone handled the stress with subdued emotion, never getting too far off the scale. Just when you thought someone was going to show some real feelings, they apologized for it. Real life is just as ugly as it is beautiful. Without the dark of night, the brightest stars would never beam their intense beauty upon us. Every masterpiece must have its extreme contrasts to fulfill the emotional needs of its audience.I'm not blaming anyone. I am sure everyone involved did their best. I am simply sharing with the reader my disappointment in what I thought would be a thrilling tribute to a horse so deserving.Ron Turcotte said the film captured the story ""pretty well"". I ask you, is ""pretty well"" good enough for the greatest race horse who ever ran on the track? Secretariat's heart was two and a half times the size of a normal horse's heart; I feel the portrayal of his story should have been two and a half times the size of any regular movie. He gave us everything he had when he ran the Belmont; thirty-one lengths ahead of Sham who was an amazing, record breaking horse in his own right. Don't we owe it to him, to give him everything we've got, to see that generations to come understand the events that transpired to make him who he is? Have we as a culture become so jaded that there can be no magic in the truth? Can the epic only be found in fiction? I don't believe it. I believe that purity of a moment of perfection forever locked in time is where magic can be found and that magic is why it brings inspiration and tears to the eyes of the soul who seeks it.Suzette Howard"
1128,tt1028576,1,"Secretariat is not only the first film in many years where both old and young can share the same theater; it contains the elements that make you both laugh and cry as most good movies should. From peaceful mornings at sunrise we experience exhilarating horse racing that brings pensive waiting for results of a race already in the history books.I agree with the Movieguide comments: ""SECRETARIAT is a very uplifting, inspiring, exciting movie about a true story, the story of a determined woman who raises one of the most successful, dynamic racehorses of all time. SECRETARIAT is stirring and joyful, with many references to God, Jesus Christ and the Bible and a pro-capitalist message celebrating American values"" Now, what's wrong with this picture? It is refreshingly entertaining."

The middle-class school teacher who works overtime to support his income and to send his children to good schools, ends up in a moral dilemma, when it comes to fulfilling the needs of his ever unsatisfied teenage children. The movie is a perfect watch for all generation and teaches everyone a lesson.All the mummy's and daddy's who haven't watch the movie should buy the DVD and watch it with your children,you will love it,and those children who think their parents are not fulfilling their wishes will understand that their parents are actually struggling."
1129,tt1028576,6,"Greetings again from the darkness. The story of Secretariat is legendary in the world of thoroughbred racing. Being a sports fan, it is always fascinating to witness domination by a singular athlete - Michael Jordan, Tiger Woods, Roger Federer. Secretariat was the Michael Jordan of racing. In 1973, Big Red dominated racing like no other.What makes this even more amazing is that Secretariat is actually the second most interesting story ... his owner, Penny Chenery Tweedy (played here by Diane Lane), was his match in competitive spirit. This Disney movie actually spends as much time on Ms. Tweedy as it does the fabulous horse.Disney does what Disney does best. This is an all out feel-good, rah-rah movie in the vein of ""Seabiscuit"", ""The Rookie"", ""Rudy"" and even ""Hoosiers"". Don't expect in-depth analysis of the racing world or horse training or even horse farm operations. This movie is made to deliver a warm fuzzy via the perseverance of a strong-willed lady and an incredibly majestic animal.Expect some over-the-top touches such as John Malkovich's portrayal of trainer Lucen Laurin, horse-whispering by Ms. Lane, and plenty of heart-string tugging as is customary from the fine folks at Disney. Expect historical facts to be treated a bit lax in some scenes (no mention of 1972 Derby winner Riva Ridge, also from the Chenery stables). Expect none of that to matter as this is a crowd-pleaser, not a documentary.In addition to Mr. Malkovich and Ms. Lane, there is some fine support work from Fred Thompson, James Cromwell and Nelsan Ellis (so great as Lafayette in True Blood). Directed by Randall Wallace, whose most recent directorial effort was 2002's ""We Were Soldiers"", this is entertainment for all ages and an easy introduction to the champion that was Secretariat."
1130,tt1028576,6,"I went into this movie not expecting anything brilliant, but a fun movie that portrayed a great horse which is exactly what it was(especially since it's a Disney movie). I had no problem that the story was mainly about Penny Chenery and what she did, my problem was that they took the most memorable and moving race of all time (The Belmont) and turned it into a rushed scene. I felt as though they did not spend enough time on Secretariat's magic that happened that day at Belmont. The fact that the race wasn't recorded at Belmont isn't the problem, because there are so many other problems with this scene. The music was just silly - no emotion whatsoever (when I watch the actual footage of this race, there is SO much emotion!). They could have made this scene far better than it was. Maybe I'm comparing it too much to the Match Race and the last race scene from the movie Sea Biscuit - now those were scenes and music put together that gave me goosebumps and tears to my eyes. Secretariat just gets a quick race scene with some silly music as he comes down the last turn. Not too emotional if you ask me. Diane Lane did a wonderful job as Penny Chenery and you are always rooting for her throughout the entire movie. I can't say the same for her family. Her husband was an ignorant jerk, as was her brother. And why did her peace loving hippie daughter get the extra screen time that Secretariat deserved!? That really irked me. Before this movie came out, so many people were assuming that Sham, Secretariats biggest rival, was not going to be mentioned at all. Well that certainly was not the case as they did a good job at letting the audience know just who Sham was, which really impressed me. I own race horses and I watch actual footage on youtube of the great ones, especially Secretariat, and I get chills and get a tear to my eye just watching him run (mainly the Derby and the Belmont), and I thought for sure there would be at least one time in the movie where I would get emotional, but no, not one scene had that effect on me. If you know a lot about horse racing and/or truly see how much of a wonderful horse Secretariat was, you will not think this movie is up to par. I also think the movie Sea Biscuit involved more emotion towards the horse from the audience more so than Secretariat does. If you are aware of how great of a horse he was, you will love him, but if you're going into this movie not knowing much about Secretariat, the director fails to bring you emotionally involved with him. I will most likely buy this movie when it comes out because overall I did enjoy it, but I just wish it could have been better.Simply put, like my title says, Secretariat (the horse himself) was nothing short of great, and this movie is decent at best, and I'm sorry, but the best race horse of all time does not deserve ""good"" or decent"" ... he deserves ""GREAT."""
1131,tt1714832,9,"I am a middle class salaried person, having two children (one son and one daughter), a wife having the typical middle-class mindset and a moderately furnished house. Till three years back, I was riding a scooter only (still I ride the scooter only for most of the time). In 2007, upon shifting from Rawatbhata (Rajasthan) to Delhi, I bought a car (Maruti 800). So when I saw the promos of this movie, I at once decided to watch it because I felt I would relate to it. And my prediction came true.Do Dooni Chaar (two twoja four) is the story of a typical middle class family living in a metro like Delhi whose head is not a permanent employee in a govt. office or a reputed company. He is a mathematics teacher (that's why the name of the movie is a mathematical one) in a private college, getting moderate salary and he supplements it by doing tuitions. He rides an old Bajaj scooter and lives with his family (consisting of his wife, son and daughter) in a moderate single bedroom flat. Like almost all the middle class Indian families, they have to spend more than their capacity for the sake of pomposity, relationships and social prestige. Like several middle class children living in metro cities, their children also like to make girlfriend / boyfriend, visit Mc Donald for eating and make quick money for out of pocket expenses which their parents are not able to provide them. Like most of Indian middle class parents, they also want their children to study in reputed English medium educational institutions and become something big in their lives. For that sake, they control their own expenses but ensure that the children's future is not adversely affected for want of money.However this Do Dooni Chaar family has a family head with a difference from likewise family heads. Though like a typical middle class housewife, the wife wants her husband to earn some extra bucks even by compromising his conscience, the head of the family has his own morals to cater to. They pay bribes to the corrupt Indian establishment under compulsion (like most middle class Indians have to) but they do not do anything likewise themselves. The first reason is conscience. However the bigger reason is fear of doing something bad (or unlawful, to be exact). However when they have to suffer humiliation upon using the neighbour's car upon the special occasion of attending a marriage in close relation, the self-respect of the head of the family (the Duggal family) gets hurt to that much extent that he decides to buy his own car. Now what happens in making arrangement for down payment of the car which is not a small amount for a hand-to-mouth family in the capital city and how several allied things come to the fore, form the post interval part of the story.Do Dooni Chaar is an excellent and very well made movie. While watching the movie I was feeling as I were Rishi Kapoor, my wife were Neetu Singh and my children were their children. Everything shown and every character shown (especially the family members) are so realistic that even for a moment you do not feel that you are watching a fictional story of an imaginary family. And it is this realistic touch of simple middle class Indian life and simple middle class Indian characters that makes this movie a winner all the way. Whether it's Rishi's prohibiting his daughter from doing a call centre job or it's his blaming himself for his son's spoilage or it's Neetu's complaining to her husband for making her leave her job or it's her fuming over the monthly income and expenditure budget of the family; everything is natural. It's the typical Indian middle class family which barely manages to live a reasonable life but still dreams big. And still owning a car and owning a house are the biggest dreams of the typical Indian middle class people.The movie also effectively underscores the nobility of the noble profession of teaching alongwith the fact that teachers (especially in the non-govt. sector schools) are the one of the least paid salaried people in India which is a major factor behind the poor educational standards in our country.Rishi-Neetu are awesome in their performances with their off screen chemistry coming alive on the screen. But the actors (Archit Krishna and Aditi Vasudev who is the anchor also) playing their children have overtaken them by their brilliant performance. All others (including Akhilendra Mishra as their neighbour and the actress playing Phupho to be specially mentioned) have also done exceedingly well.Music is not great except the marriage song - Banni Hamaari Chaand Se Pyaari. The art director has done a splendid job by capturing the life in Delhi with utmost reality. In fact the whole Do Dooni Chaar team deserves a big hand alongwith the writer-director Habib Faisal. The only thing which may not appeal to the non-Delhites and non-Punjabis is the overdoz of Punjabi language. But that's not a big issue.This movie reminiscing the Hrishikesh Mukherjee-Basu Chatterjee movies of the seventies and early eighties, is just like a gust of fresh and cool breeze in the cinematic environment suffocated by so-called NRI movies. I recommend this light-mood family drama wholeheartedly and unconditionally to all the movie buffs."
1132,tt1714832,9,"Do Dooni Char is one small episode portraying a middle-class Delhi family struggling through their financial limitations. It is a humorous and enjoyable movie throughout but is more impressive for its authenticity and realistic feel more than the story itself. The story is where this exceptionally good film scores. The spirit of Delhi and its middle-class families ha been wonderfully captured. The casts,sets and the costumes are all very simple and thus create an enchanting sense of everyday realism which is very missing in Hindi films. The film has its moments and it actually deals with problems not usually dealt with in Indian movies, such as the modest salaries professional teachers get paid for their efforts and how this affects their life.The pairing of Neetu and Rishi Kapoor adds to the advantage of the movie and makes it much more better.Its great to see both of them on screen together after decades. The story deals with the life of Santosh Duggal,played by Rishi Kapoor. He is forced to use a scooter and at some point this starts saddening him and his family.The movie is also about the dream of the family to own a car.A lovely way of conveying a concept, and it is generally well done.The biggest plus point is the casting, particularly of Rishi Kapoor, who delivers an excellent performance. Neetu Singh is very good, especially considering the fact that she had not acted for decades. Do Dooni Chaar is a great film that relates to the life of many Indian middle class families and reminds of our childhood days.A real entertainer for me."

He is forced to use a scooter and at some point this starts saddening him and those who surround him. Quite a lovely way of conveying a concept, and it is generally well done, but at times the movie is way too messy and hard to follow.

1151,tt1015971,9,"I don't know about the previous reviewer, but what possibly could have been done better than this superb documentary? Lifeless it isn't, clumsy it isn't. It's touching, and filled with many fascinating insights. The use of seeing parallel home movies by the brothers during their estrangement was an inspired one. It's very well done, people. It does exactly what it sets out to do, and then some. I hope people will seek out this film and see for themselves just how good it is.For a Disney release, it's also interesting to see non-Disney films incorporated to give a more balanced look at the brothers' film scores. For baby boomers, this film will be an added pleasure, since so much of this music here most likely was a strong presence during their growing years. Don't miss this one!"
1135,tt1714832,1,"Thank God, I'm watching lot of good films nowadays!! It is good for mental health!! Do Dooni Chaar is a movie that is excellent in all aspects. Be it the casting, the dialogues, the direction, or anything. Just one word, excellent!! There have been crap movies in the past, there have been movies in which the director attempted to do something good ,but ended up as a failure. I suggest such people watch this movie. This is a textbook for people who want to make simple films with great intentions. Of course, Do Dooni Chaar hits the right target, and that is the success of the director. No wonder, after watching this movie Sachin Tendulkar wanted to act in this director's movie. And one more thing, this movie is produced by Arindam Chaudhury, the famous economist and the founder of IIPM. He has done a good thing to produce such a great movie. So, what's the movie about?? It revolves around the life of Duggal family, consisting of a dad, mom and two children. Real life couple Rishi Kapoor and Neetu Singh have come up together on screen after so many years, ant the chemistry is extra ordinary. The girl and the boy who acted as their children are equally good. The story is completely natural, simple and refreshing. The movies like Do Dooni Chaar should be made, this is doubtlessly a real gem in Indian cinema, one of the best movies of the recent times!! Habib Faizal, you rock!!"
1136,tt1714832,7,"I don't remember when was the last time i saw a movie with such a simple but strong storyline. I won't term this movie as a comedy but it definitely had humor in it. The plot of the movie is so simple that any middle class Indian would be able to relate to it, the dream of Duggal Family to become the owner of a four wheeler from a two wheeler(as you can already make out from the title). Rishi Kapoor essays the role of a low earning maths teacher which he played to perfection, hardworking and still hated by his students(reminded me of some of my school teachers), Neetu Kapoor was the housewife who in parts reminded me of my mother, hardworking and tired but still non complaining. Add to that two kids who always have complaints from there parents as they are trying to become a part of the high society friend circle. The house and the society in which the Duggal's stayed kept me guessing through out the movie as to which part of Delhi was it as it could have been any middle class Punjabi dominated area of Delhi. Add to this a lot of complicated situations to the life of the Duggal's in their effort of buying a car and you get a complete family package. It is a movie without the usual glam sham which you expect from a Hindi movie but considering the story and the excellent acting of Rishi Kapoor, I don't think there was a need for any. See this if you like simple family movies without any melodramas."
1137,tt1714832,8,"I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. The storyline is funny, the acting is good and the best part is the movie is not too out there. My biggest pet peeve with most bollywood movies is that everything is too loud and exaggerated.. This thankfully isn't one of those movies. The story is about a middle-class teacher and nothing is out of the ordinary. No glamorous daughter who hangs out in pubs all night, no over-dramatic wife, no weird spoilt filmy children. As a matter of fact, the attention to detail with which the director has shown a middle class family is just too darn amazing.. There are so many little things you can notice about your average everyday middle-class family that not only make you wonder the amount of effort that was put into researching, but which also make the movie genuinely funny and likable! Like I particularly liked the scene where Rishi kapoor adjusts the wires of his nightlamp to make it work (presumably as it was without a plug), or how neetu singh is washing the verandah in slippers and socks.. such little things! The acting is also very good.. rishi kapoor makes it look effortless.. neetu singh does a convincing role of your everyday housewife.. the kids even though in college thankfully aren't also prancing around singing songs in college either... If you need to see the real Delhi this is the movie you should watch.. really good clean fun!"
1138,tt1714832,9,"Was flipping through channels on Sunday night after having nothing better to do and saw this wonderful movie do dooni char. Captured essence of middle class life so succinctly and reminded me of my childhood. Best was ending of movie when narrator (daughter of protagonist) claims that consumerism is not bad. In family's desire to buy a car they could rediscover their dad, started taking pride in their lives and his brother and father came close to each other. Their effort to win lucky draw by opening thousand boxes of detergent reminded me of how dutifully mom was collecting each edition of local newspaper when they had a maruti draw or how I used to try KBC phone religiously in college. Typical middle class dreams and desire to fulfill them. How one has societal pressures of showing one in good position in marriage at one's relatives, how neighbors fight and learn to live together and how old teachers always live in heart of students."
1139,tt1714832,8,"Long after ""Khosla ka ghosla"" has a good movie with middle class background has come up. I would say the movie is far better than anyone can expect of Habib Faisal.The movie starts with a very simple layout and continues the simplicity of middle class throughout. Definitely the characters are perfect suited for their roles and the storyline. Rishi Kapoor and Neetu Singh came out very realistic. This movie has changed the picture of Rishi Kapoor-the rich dad to Rishi Kapoor-a middle class man.The movie portrays a normal family with mummy like housewife saving a rupee wherever possible; father still using age-old scooter; decent and trying to be a boy daughter; and a ambitious son doing just good with his demanding girlfriend. The best part is there were no Golmaal-type events or songs to make the viewer happy or sad and everything comes out very naturally except for 1-2 scenes. I assure you the climax is not very expected type but you would appreciate the originality and attention to detail.Basically, the movie contains a great deal of drama, comedy, sentiments and definitely suspense as to what happens of the CAR. If you liked ""Khosla ka ghosla-quest for middle class house"" this ""quest for a car"" is your type. No food for thought-just entertainment."
1140,tt1714832,8,"The portrayal of Mr. Duggal of a honest, hard-working teacher is amazing. Any teacher looks forward to appreciation and respect of his hard-work and efforts towards making a student realizing his potential. This is hardly recognized by parents/guardians. They think teaching is another way of making money, whereas that is not true. Loved the way director and script-writer projected the thoughts of common man towards the noble profession of teaching. Another aspect that really makes movie special is the exploration of parent-children relationship. Parents sometimes forget that they are also equally responsible as much as a child for going astray.Fine approach to describe state of teachers in our country though I don't completely agree with the climax."
1141,tt0398286,1,"Let me start by saying that I'm an 18 year old male, and was kinda dragged into watching this by my girlfriend, who is a big fan of the Disney princess movies. I finally gave in the other day, and I've very glad that I did. The movie looked gorgeous, the animation was spot on; all while holding on to the classic Disney feel. The main characters are extremely likable. Repunzel is your typical Disney princess style character: sweet, funny, etc. Eugene, aka Flynn Rider, kinda stole the show for me, but maybe that's because I'm slightly gender biased. Nonetheless, you can't deny his wit and humor. Maximus the horse fills the role of animal sidekick perfectly; just as good as Donkey was to Shrek even though he doesn't talk. While the plot is relatively predictable, it was still quite an enjoyable movie. I didn't find myself to be bored at only of the parts, and I was laughing a lot more than I had expected to. This movie is an instant classic, and a near perfect example of what animated fairy tales should be like if they want to appeal to a wide range of viewers, not just tween girls. The ending was sweet and should leave everybody happy. I think there's enough fun in this movie for all ages, including an 18 year old guy like me."
1142,tt0398286,1,"After seeing the previews I thought it'd be a light hearted and fun movie to watch but it just exceeded my expectations.The humor is only slightly outranked by the facial expressions, particularly those of Rider. Maximum was hilarious. A horse with a mind of his own that can do quite a number of 'stunts'.I would highly recommend this movie not only to adults but for young children as well. It's fast, exiting and very entertaining.I didn't find any parts to be 'slow going' and it certainly put a new slant on the old story of Rapunzel.A real 'feel good happy' type of movie."
1143,tt0398286,1,"I will start by saying that I am a 62 year old grandfather of three (9, 8, and 5) who has no connection to Disney in any way. I took the grandkids today to see this movie and they loved it, as did I. The 3D is worth going to. There is enough silliness, adventure, and romance to allow boys and girls of almost all ages to love this show. There were some funny lines in the show that kids would not understand, but adults would enjoy. I heard a gentleman laughing throughout the whole show. I am not around teenagers, so I am not sure how a teenager would respond to this show. The storyline was different but predictable. That should not discourage anyone from going to this show. I would rate it as one of the best, if not the best animation show I have ever seen. This show is a winner as a family show."
1144,tt0398286,9,"I will start off by simply saying that this movie is excellent. No, the word excellent doesn't even describe this movie well enough, because it is better than excellent. I could not take my eyes away movie for the hour and a half of the film. Even if the movie was seven hours long my eyes would still be glued to the screen for the whole time. Along with Up, this has to be the best animated movie ever made.The animation was outstanding, and I was amazed at all of the little details in all of the characters, objects, and backgrounds in every frame of every scene. The film is full of breathtaking and amazing images. The scene with all of the floating lanterns was one of the most beautiful things I have seen in a movie. Nothing could have been done to improve the amazing visuals and animation used.Before first seeing the movie, I hadn't realized that it was a musical, so that was a pleasant surprise for me. I have heard people say that the movie was great while the music was only average or not that good. I, on the other hand, thought that the music was wonderful and fit perfectly with what was happening, whether it be the action and fighting scenes or the calmer scenes like the lantern scene.Also, this movie actually made me laugh, and I don't laugh much during most animated movies. Personally, I thought that the dialogue was great and all of the characters worked well together. I especially loved the relationship with Rapunzel and Flynn, because it could be comical at one point and then touching at the next. And not only was the dialogue be used for comedy, but it also was used to create beautiful and touching scenes. Even thinking about the line were Flynn told Rapunzel she was his new dream and when she told him that he was hers gives me chills.I really hope that this movie gets an Oscar. True, Toy Story 3 and How to Train Your Dragon were both outstanding movies, but I think Tangled is the most deserving in the animated film category. Every aspect of the film was perfect. The animation, the story, and the score all were excellent and when combined they made a movie that couldn't have been better.Congratulations Disney, you've got me tangled. I wish I could see it again, but unfortunately I think I'll just have to wait until it comes out onto DVD. I hope to see more movies like this in the future.Oh, and by the way, I'm a guy. A teenage guy. So really this movie should appeal to all audiences. If you love a good movie that is charming, funny, beautiful, and touching, then go see the movie Tangled. You won't be disappointed."
1145,tt0398286,1,"This movie hits the mark on all levels. It is beautifully illustrated and the story is simple, yet works and keeps your interest. I'm not a big song guy..... but the songs in this movie are very good. Either very funny or, when the love songs begin, nicely done with some good lyrics and music. It's a '10' all the way across the board. In keeping with the Disney animators reputation for hiding phallic symbols, this has maybe the most blatant one of all. When the mother is standing near the window, her shadow is unmistakably harder than Chinese arithmetic. Keep an eye out for it..... But, this movie really is well done. The song and visuals in the tavern with all the thug characters is pretty funny. Definitely see this one!!"
1146,tt0398286,1,"I was very sketchy walking into this movie. I didn't know what to expect, it's Disney which is promising, but it's also Disney's first CGI Disney movie that got a PG rating, so it seemed different. It was pretty hard for me to choose between 'Tangled' or 'Burlesque' but I'm glad I made the decision to watch 'Tangled'. This film has everything, for everyone, boys girls and tongue in cheek humor for adults. It's Disney's answer to Shrek, but in a classy way, that doesn't feed off of pop culture. The story of the film is simple. Rapunzel is a princess that has hair that has power to heal and keep people young, but once it's cut, it loses all power. When Rapunzel was just an infant she was kidnapped by an old woman who locked her away in a tower to keep her hair all to herself. Rapunzel grows up thinking that her kidnapper is in fact her mother, and the reason she's locked away is because her 'mother' wants to keep her safe from the hardships of the world. I'd tell you more about the movie but I don't want to ruin it. Let's just say she runs away. Very simple, fairy tale plot.I was kind of saddened that Disney has succumbed to making Princess movies using CGI, but watching this movie I realize that some scenes wouldn't have the power it had, if it were in 2D. The lantern lighting scene, for example, was amazing. It wouldn't have been the same in 2D. The music, was perfect. Enough musical number to keep Disney fans more than satisfied and not enough to where it's overkill. The songs were heartfelt and meaningful, they all served a purpose, it wasn't just a nameless song thrown into the movie. The voice acting, by Mandy Moore and Zachary Levi were amazing. I was a little sketchy about Mandy. I'm a long time fan, but I wasn't sure if she had the right voice to be a Disney Princess. She gave Rapunzel so much life, and innocence, I couldn't think of any other actress who could play her better. Zachary gave Flynn life, and humor, and made him a very likable character. However, the two characters that stole the show were Pascal, the chameleon, and Maximus, the horse. Although these supporting characters have no speaking lines, through actions and emotions, you know exactly what they want to say, and the message comes in loud and clear. This movie has enough action and comedy to keep boys happy and enough emotion, romance and drama to keep the girls happy. There are a few scenes that made me tear a little, well maybe more than a little. Some scenes have so much emotion and depth that it tugs at your heartstrings, and gives you goosebumps, especially the lantern scenes. Disney is testing the waters of their film making with this one. There were many alcohol references and even references about being drunk. There's violence, people getting stabbed, and yes, even blood. Which you never see is Disney movies. Overall, I highly recommend this movie, to everyone. Anyone could enjoy this movie. It's very hard not to like it. With theater prices so high, I suggest you don't spend 10 dollars to watch Cher and Christina, but watch 'Tangled' instead. They don't make movies like this anymore. It's much better than last year's 'Princess and the Frog'. Rapunzel is now in the line-up of classic Disney princess. I cannot stress how amazing this film is. Go out and see it."
1147,tt0398286,8,"Honestly, when is the last time you saw a decent Disney Animated feature? No no, PIXAR does not count. I'm talking about just a regular ol' straight laced Disney flick. If your like me, I'm sure your answer falls somewhere in the mid 90's. But isn't that a shame? What happened to the totally awesome Disney movies? If your excuse is because of technology, i assure you that your wrong. You can make a great animated movie without resorting to actual hand drawn art. But where is that old feeling we all use to share? Well i can tell you this much....i already knew that Disney had something special here, mainly because the VP of PIXAR jumped ship and decided to fund this project. The first time anyone from PIXAR has ever done so, let alone the freakin VP. So needless to say, Disney finally had enough, and pulled out all the stops for this one.I kid you not when i say this....""Tangled"" is easily the best Disney Animated feature i have seen since ""Aladdin"".....yes, it is that good. They finally let go of trying to find something new and different and settled with what was working for them almost 20 years ago. It's a princess tale that easily falls into the same category with the classics. So wait, does that mean i'm comparing it to the likes of ""Snow White"" ""Cinderella"" and ""Sleeping Beauty""? You damn right i am! Sure the storyline is cliché' and relative to other Disney classics, but it felt so good to see and feel something that helped recall your childhood. But other than those minor speed bumps, the movie is spot on. The animation is spectacular, and you would be a fool not to see it in 3D. The musical sequences didn't seem forced and were never boring. And i can almost guarantee you that it will snag the best song award at the Oscars. I'm just glad that they didn't work the story around the music, which is what a lot of animated features tend to slip up on. But this one did an amazing job of hybriding them together.Bottom Line, ladies and gentleman, this is the Disney picture you have been waiting for. It will definitely win your heart and please audiences both young and old."
1148,tt0398286,1,"I have seen this movie 3 times as of today, and possibly 4 as of next week, if that gives anyone a good idea of what a fantastic movie this is. Tangled is now my favorite of the 50 Disney animated movies out there, or any animated movie for that matter. Despite fans of the classic Disney princess being down on the CGI animation, I to the contrary found that this was a vast improvement. The scenery and basic concepts were still classic Disney, but the CGI made them movie vivid and realistic but in a cute animated way. The characters were all very deep, and all added their own humorous aspects to the movie. Repunzel was a bad ass without being violent, and more lovable than the rest of the princesses combined. The prince was actually a bandit role (Flynn) and way more dimensional than previous princes. He was a main part of the movie, and he added a great contrast to Repunzel's naive heroine. I left having a crush on Flynn, and wanting to go to the pet store to buy a pet chameleon. I predict that at the end of the movie you will leave feeling lighter at heart, and transported back to being a wide eyed youngster. Well, I did anyway."
1149,tt0398286,1,"I saw the finished movie at the screening before the wrap party. The movie works on every level. The Characters, the animation, the story, the score, the romance, and it's all very cute as well (in a way Disney can apparently still pull off). The one thing that I didn't get into was the songs (Except maybe the ""Mother Knows Best"" reprise). They were a little weak melodically and you won't be singing them for weeks like I do ""Part of Your World"" every time I watch the ""Little Mermaid."" However, the songs are good enough not to bring the movie down. There are so many touching scenes in this movie and you will love all of the characters by the end and have an amazing time in the process. It is definitely worth seeing in the theater, as this is probably the prettiest computer animated movie I've seen. I just can't wait to see it in stereo!(BTW, I'm a 30 year old male who grew up with Disney. And I feel like I'm being objective when I say this movie works as a movie and not as a movie exclusively for 10 year old girls.)"
1150,tt0398286,1,"A wonderful movie! I had forgotten all about Tangled, and am so glad I got to see it on the big screen. A great story with fun characters and beautiful animation that still looks new."
1152,tt1015971,8,"This little shown intimate portrait of the Sherman Brothers seems to have been largely overlooked in favor of the more broadly drawn ""Waking Sleeping Beauty"". That is most unfortunate because this is much more profound both as a peek into the creative functioning of the Disney empire...and as a fascinating unvarnished love letter to the astonishingly prolific and inspired team that gave the studio product so much of it's sparkle...This is an exquisite film with the interviews and clips arranged for maximum impact...(the DVD is even more of a treasure trove...the out-takes and extended scenes being just as valuable as the material that made the final cut). The tear jerking moments depicting ""The Boys'"" relationship with Walt Disney...and his love for ""Feed the Birds"" has been hinted at before...but this film brings it into a clear focus that makes it a must see for everyone who ever loved one of the studio's films...or ever hummed along to one of the teams immortal creations.There will be some people upset that this ends up being less of a happily ever after fairy tale than they would expect. This documentary lovingly depicts the somewhat strained relationship between two brothers who were very different people and how they were able to come together in one glorious project...the creation of songs that will live as long as there are children to re-discover them.Co-directed by the sons of ""The Boys"" this is also a delicious portrait of the lives of two families...and of Hollywood Magic in the mid 20th century...The moving reminiscences and archival clips are alone worth the price of the Disc!"
1153,tt1015971,9,"We were fortunate to see this film here in Toronto last night in advance of its (I think only) theatrical release. Even more fortunate was the fact that the two directors/sons and Dick Sherman were in attendance and did Q&A afterwards. Dick even had a piano and played some of the brothers' songs, explaining, among other things, how the music of ""Spoonful of Sugar"" was written as a reflection of the character of Mary Poppins. I'm a bit of a curmudgeon and attended with my 18-year old daughter. We both had tears in our eyes on several occasions during the film and afterwards. How two brothers who are so different can work so successfully together for so many decades and yet never see one another outside their working hours is a remarkable story, simply and lovingly told. The film also provides some interesting insights into the Disney studio during its heyday."
1154,tt1015971,9,"Starting in 1961 with an inauspicious tune called ""Strummin' Song"" (from ""The Horsemasters""), brothers Robert and Richard Sherman, sons of Russian-Jewish immigrants, became the in-house, go-to songwriters for the Walt Disney Company. They churned out one melodious, deceptively simple ditty after another, until they eventually hit upon Oscar gold with their score from ""Mary Poppins"". As it turns out, the fabulously talented Shermans are not unlike most siblings: there are rivalries between the two, personality differences which cause them to clash, and they're not really the best of friends. This incredibly moving documentary, directed by the duo's sons, Gregory and Jeff Sherman, was a valiant attempt to get Robert and Richard to reconcile their feelings for one another--and to acknowledge their extensive body of work, which is often unfairly criticized as being sappy or sugary. It may indeed seem a bit of a stretch to compare the Shermans to John Lennon and Paul McCartney...but after hearing such wonderful songs as ""Feed the Birds"" (Walt's personal favorite), ""On the Front Porch"" (Robert's favorite), ""A Spoonful of Sugar"", ""Winnie the Pooh"", and ""It's a Small World"", among others, their resume becomes a virtual collection of childhood memories. The Shermans deserved this valentine to their talents as sentimental and romantic songwriters par excellence, and the family story which slowly plays out behind-the-scenes underscores their sunshiny output with realistic melancholy. It is quite an achievement. ***1/2 from ****"
1155,tt1104001,1,"Yes. I had watched this movie back in 2010 when I was in school. Didn't understand much, but I was blown away by the visuals.. But now watching in 2019, it all makes sense and the visuals are yet world class. This movie was ahead of its time.Worth watching!"
1156,tt1104001,1,"TRON: Legacy is a literal misunderstood masterpiece & is one of the most intellectual, deepest science-fiction movies I've seen Disney produce - EVER! Let me explain:
Immediately, CLU has strong, deliberate similarities with Hitler - they both wanted to create ""the perfect system"" & viewed those in their society who were similar to themselves as superior, where individuals are only deemed valuable if they can be used to further implement & reassert the oppressive structures in place.In TRON, any program deemed useless or unfit for work is sent into ""the games"", where they're to be slaughtered for the amusement of less ""disposable"" citizens - disabled / programs unable to be ""rectified"" are lesser & have no place in this system CLU has created. It's as if those who cannot contribute, may rebel or show resistance cannot be allowed to exist & so only the obedient, functioning rectified ones remain.This is a symbolic representation of a fascist regime where those ruled under it are controlled by fear & intimidation - ""rectified"" programs are representative depictions of people who are brainwashed by a system & further explains why those who can't be are sent to their deaths. Any imperfection is prohibited & made an example of - uniformity is essential & total, unquestioning loyalty to the cause is expected. Again, noticeable connotations are made in order to reflect Nazi Germany; CLU commits genocide by wiping out the ISOs who represent / relate to the Jewish population within 'Legacy' & there's a resonant message of defiance throughout the film.It's also a metaphor for mental health - with CLU depicting the worst of humanity & what it's capable of when a mind is corrupted by power & greed, embodying the darkest side of ourselves. Additionally, on the opposite side, Kevin Flynn is in a state of depression when we first meet him again in the movie - he's been battling his demons & has given up, justifying his lack of action by saying ""the only way to win the game is by not playing"" but Sam Flynn challenges his problematic ideological attitude & his son visually journeys into the mind of his father (who hasn't been there for him throughout his childhood because he's lost himself inside his own head) in order to regain a relationship he missed out on as he was growing up in order to save him, battling his demons alongside him so he can bring him back out into the real world, teaching him that by resigning himself to what he deemed as inevitable, he only allowed the darkness inside the Grid (a metaphor for his mind) to grow & spread like cancer. These two themes intertwine when Sam goes against his father's wishes by fighting - sparking what would grow to become genuine character progression of Kevin.Sam meets other members of the resistance & begins to fight back & only when his life is in danger does Kevin realise that not only do his inner demons pose a risk to himself, but those he loves & others around him, so his supposedly harmless inaction is shown to have consequences, forcing his hand & beginning his journey of recovery. Hence - linking back to politics - it also signifies that the only way for a fascist state to thrive is when good people do nothing - they are complicit in the actions of CLU by allowing him to continue without resistance. Fascist states are vulnerable & fragile & when people rise up against them, they crumble. Hence, it reaffirms this point when CLU's plan is immediately jeopardized once people act.As Kevin & Sam battle corrupted programs & CLU, they head towards their escape - a light that shines brightly through the darkness at the end of a tunnel (another metaphor for depression). It's at this point when Kevin realises that the only way to save his son is by confronting his fears, face to face, coming to terms with who he is & what he's capable of, what kind of person he has the potential to be & makes a choice to embrace the light again instead of resigning himself to the darkness. He sees the danger he poses to those he loves if his darker self isn't stopped & so sacrifices himself, visually embracing his darker side (coming to terms with it) & overwhelming it with light in the ultimate show of love towards the child he never got to see grow up. By doing this, we're led to assume that he dies but he neutralises the threat & redeems himself in the eyes of his son. It's a total act of redemption; a father battling his depression & being trapped inside a prison of his own making for years - how those suffering are able to win if they accept help & don't fight the battles they have to face alone when there are those willing to support surrounding them.Kevin Flynn starts the story as powerless & concludes as powerful. It's about family & incorporates socio-political themes brilliantly. Even more genius, CLU didn't understand humanity & that's poetically what saves it - he was unable to understand that there is no such thing as ""perfection""; it's subjective & thus his system is ironic due to the basic flaw in what is supposed to be perfect. It shows how easy it is to topple such a regime once that flaw is exposed; it's a weakness - not a strength - & individuality is what makes a society strong; CLU's misguided idea about this ultimately leads to his demise. He doesn't understand because he's made himself into less of a reflection of humanity than intended, so can't foresee what his opponent Kevin will do for love as love isn't a concept he considers or acknowledges due to his lack of humanity. He's absolved himself of any trace of it in order to become ""perfect"" but it's a pathetic fallacy.The darkest side of humanity acts upon irrational thoughts, sometimes selfish or cowardly & sometimes from an unintentional misinterpretation of unclear information. Once we look at things from an objective point of view, we see the cracks in the logic & only upon self reflection can we change ourselves for the better. We're reminded of that here.Not to mention, it's worth noting the beautiful direction from Joseph Kosinski (unbelievably, his first ever feature film!?) - who does an astounding job of crafting such a subtextually rich tale - & appreciating the faultless, sleek, stylised visuals - honestly, jaw-droppingly GORGEOUS & effective cinematography from Claudio Miranda - who leaves you in awe of the aesthetic & his meticulous use of light while watching & visually, it's undeniably one of the most iconic, inventive & distinctive movies I've ever seen with groundbreaking visual effects, world building that's phenomenally immersive from the moment you step foot within it - with masterful, artistic hair & make-up, sound & costume design & additionally, production design - as well as the electrifying score by musical legends Daft Punk who craft one of the best soundtracks for any movie in history... TRON: Legacy was a gift to all who've been longing for an original sci-fi franchise & most of y'all slept on it. It's an utter travesty."
1157,tt1104001,8,"It's not highly likely to win many new converts, but for those who already like the original and want to see more of that world, it more than satisfies. The visuals are a wonderful evolution from Tron and the story of a father and son who have to make up for lost time is very touching. The CGI face they developed for Jeff Bridges is not perfect, but it works very well with just a few exceptions and I feel, for my own tastes, that they have actually bridged the uncanny valley with this one. Still a bit of work to get it perfect, but this one works as it is. Oh, and the score by Daft Punk is beautiful. The first thing my brother and I did after leaving the theater was buy the sound track on the way home. It's very suggestive of the original but with plenty of today's newer sensibilities mixed in."
1158,tt1104001,9,"This is the one sequel I actually like. More correctly, I love it.This work of art is gorgeous to look at, has an apprropiate soundtrack and the morale of the film is amazing (hint: companies like Microsoft won't like it) or one can just watch and enjoy the original story."
1159,tt1104001,9,"Everything about this film works. The visuals, writing, acting, everything. There are very few wrong things I can find with Tron, especially the soundtrack which is timeless even almost a decade later. I still remember watching this film in theaters and not regretting it at all. I highly recommend this film for fans of anything quality.From the pacing to the cinematography this film is astoundingly well made, and truly deserves more recognition. It is timeless in every meaning of the word."
1160,tt1104001,7,"The original movie was generic. While it's far from bad, it's plot was simplistic in terms of the overall focus being on the good vs evil side and less on the thematic element it established of Flynn and all users being gods. It serves as a mythology, however, to a much more insightful legend which unfolds in this movie. But the problem is, due to the somewhat simplistic nature of the predecessor, people failed to give attention to the themes of this film, preferring to focus on the generic side as that's what they'd expect from a Tron movie. But the movie doesn't stay generic, so when viewers find nothing simple to see they assume the movie is empty. It's not, they're minds are just preset to look for simple ""turn off your brain and be entertained"" values, which simply aren't present in this film.The whole movie, just like the original, is similar to the idea of a religious mythology. The original featured programs as disciples of the users, enslaved for their belief. But that plays a small role overall. Here, when the Grid is reprogrammed to the image of Kevin Flynn, Flynn is established to the status of ""the one true god"" at least of this version of the grid, and all the other users who contribute new programs are just angels. But the maker of this world is Flynn, regardless of whether or not he writes the fates of these people. So, much like the original Hebrew form of god, he is not so much a ruler who demands worship or enforce any rules but just a wise and experienced being here to help when he's needed.And it's not so much an analogy to call Flynn god as it is TRUE. He has successfully created a world, not a platform. A world that's self sustaining and requires no more intervention of the users, as displayed by the ISOs which created themselves and were programmed by no-one.And this demands many questions! If they'd been allowed to live, would the ISOs have made this world like our own in thousands of years? Does this mean that's how our own god could have created our own world and how we came to be? Questions of such layered nature can't simply be ignored as style over substance.And then there comes CLU, the best friend of Flynn who he trusted. But as god, I dare say it, may have been somewhat confused in his image he had for the world in his early form, so did Flynn suffer from this same confusion of image for his world. This causes CLU to suffer a similar fate of uncertainty, making him only able to understand that his god is incapable of creating a perfect world since he can't imagine one. Thus, taking matters into his own hands, he abandons his god and does what he sees to be right. But the problem is he expects to get a different result with the same thinking as his flawed god, the only thinking he has been exposed to, and makes even worse mistakes than his god, making Flynn see the errors of his ways. Thus, a most appropriate analogy, CLU becomes the Satan to Flynn's god.But the ultimate piece of symbolism that outmatches anything else in the movie, is the final attempt of CLU to get Flynn's disc. He realizes Flynn has tricked him, by giving the disc he sought to his son. He discovered that the son of Flynn, and thus the son of a god, has obtained the disc and power he seeks, and thus he must obtain it. There is so much symbolism that flies past viewers in what happens next. When CLU realizes he has been tricked, he raises his disc to derez Flynn and then go get the right one, but only violently places the disc beside Flynn, subtly showing in the end he still considered Flynn his friend and could not bring himself to kill him. CLU runs to obtain this disc from the obstacle stopping him from having the ultimate power, showing the rivalry between the Satan and savior of this world.Such themes like this show the filmmakers truly put a lot of thought into their creation, not a lack of it, so people need to stop discrediting them and their work."
1161,tt1104001,8,Great great movie always get chills from the music and when he first uses the bike. Love the atmosphere of Sam Flynn's life and how much love he has for his father at the end of the movie. Fantastic message in the movie where we as people think things are important in our life such as work or possessions but nothing is more important then family 👍.
1162,tt1104001,1,"And it was worth it.I was 9 years old when I saw TRON in a dingy cinema in Fareham, I was hooked then, and I always dreamed they would make a sequel.I was seriously worried though, I mean, Escape from New York was another of my favourite movies and I got all excited about the sequel to that... and left the cinema mortified...Not this time.This was like an old friend coming home.There are a lot of comments about this movie having a poor story, personally, I disagree. It was a father and son story, any more on top of the other sub plots going on would have been too much.It's a hell of an experience for the sences... when those Recognizers flew overhead the cinema shook... immersive, entertaining... everything a good movie should be.Roll on Number 3."

Though Sam is the heir, he refuses to play an active role in the decision-making process. Alan Bradley (Boxleitner) meets him one night with the news that he has received a page from Kevin Flynn's arcade - a number that has been disconnected for 20 years. Thus ensues the inevitable investigation into his father's whereabouts and Sam's transportation into the world his father has created and been trapped in for decades.Where to begin? Tron: Legacy is a visual feast for your eyes and an auditory pleasure thanks to Daft Punk and Joseph Trapanese. The soundtrack feels ethereal almost and fits perfectly with this new world we have been introduced to for the first time (or the 2nd time if you've seen the 1982 original). 3D, for me, is a recent scourge that has been infecting and affecting the movie industry. Yes, maybe it is a more lucrative avenue for the movie industry after the setback of heavy piracy but enough is enough! Joseph Kosinski, however, had a vision (and an architectural degree behind him) to give us a mouth-opening, simply beautiful world with the correct blend of 2D and 3D! It is quite simply worth it just to go for the visuals.What the movie makes up for in spectacular imagery, it lacks in storyline. Maybe I should have watched the 1982 version as so many people have pointed out to me but even without it, the plot seems a little disjointed. The underlying connections to the real world are numerous such as The Holocaust, God complexes, evil doppelgangers and more. You are left with more questions than answers as it is never revealed just what it is about this world that would ""change everything"" in the real world.Jeff Bridges is great as both the villain and hero and his computer animated self is simply amazing although at the same time off-putting (this might be the Uncanny Valley hypothesis at work). The acting overall is not anything to write home about (no Oscar winners here) but Hedlund as Sam Flynn holds his own against a more charismatic Jeff Bridges. Quorra (Wilde) provides a potential love interest and the key to changing our world and a doe-eyed innocent view of life that is endearing.This is a movie that should be simply taken for what it is, a pandering to the original fan base whilst garnering new ones, one not to be over- analysed but simply to be marvelled at with a group of friends. The actions scenes are just jaw-dropping with light cycles (that I wish I owned!) and deadly Frisbees amongst other things. Disney took a risk to continue a series almost 3 decades later rather than going for the easy option of re-imagining it. A wise move."
1164,tt1104001,8,"I have never seen the original 'Tron', nor do I really know much about it really. I've only heard the movie referenced on occasion (like that one episode of The Simpsons where Homer's trapped in the Third Dimension and he asks if anybody saw the movie 'Tron', and everyone says ""No.""). The previews for 'Tron: Legacy' looked visually stunning, and I'm happy to report it does not disappoint in that regard. Everything seen inside ""The Grid"" is a wonder to behold, a visual feast. But is this the only thing the film has going for it? Well...yes and no. As far as the characters/actors who portray them are concerned...Garrett Hedlund is good as Sam Flynn. Yes, he has to utter some clunky dialogue along the way and is a bit stiff at times, but he serves the role well enough. At times he reminded me of Hayden Christensen as Anakin Skywalker (what with the pulling out of lightsabers...I mean discs, donning of cloaks, etc) - though not half as bad as him.Jeff Bridges gives a solid performance as Sam's dad, Kevin Flynn. The only thing that detracts from his acting is his digitised clone, Clu. No matter how hard they have tried to create a youthful-looking Jeff Bridges using computer magic, he still looks like a ""cartoon"" (as someone in the audience put it). While it's annoying, it would have at least been tolerable if it had been limited to just the scenes inside The Grid. However, the movie starts in the the real world with a ""young"" Kevin Flynn telling his son the story of Tron/The Grid, and you can plainly tell the drastic difference between a real and fake Jeff Bridges. It's so obvious, and very distracting. Olivia Wilde kicks butt and looks great doing it (in her skintight catsuit with neon highlights and her asymmetrical wig) as the warrior, Quorra. She seems to be having a lot more fun with this role than she does with that of Thirteen on 'House'. Quorra has a slight naivety about her in regards to some things, and displays a sense of childlike wonder on occasion (especially the end), which gives her some depth. Wilde and Hedlund share some good scenes together, and her character at least gets *some* development - which is more than I can say for the albino-like ""Siren"", Gem (Beau Garrett).Michael Sheen is memorable as Castor. While he does tend to ""ham it up"" a bit, it's nonetheless a delightful performance.Apart from the animation of Young Kevin Flynn, there are a couple of other 'minuses' of the film, like the dialogue (which is oftentimes average) and the fact that the film itself does seem to drag in spots/go on for a bit too long.However, the visuals *do* almost manage to make up for most of the film's faults (almost). The movie looks stunning - after we get past the kinda boring beginning and are transported along with Sam inside The Grid. Light Cycles, Light Runners, all mode of ""Light"" transportation make for thrilling action/chase sequences. Then there's the ""games"", that mostly seem to involve throwing discs - which resemble Xena's round killing thing - at each other, causing those who are hit to ""derez"" (ie. cease to exist). Another 'plus' for this film is its excellent score. It adds SO much to the movie.The film is entertaining enough, but probably not the non-stop action some people are expecting/hoping for. If you're looking to kill a couple hours watching something that's visually pleasing (but, at the same time, may give you a headache/sore eyes thanks to the 3D), then 'Tron: Legacy' is worth checking out. Fans of the original may or may not like this movie, I'm not sure, but I know that for someone like myself - who's being introduced to the world of 'Tron' for the first time - it was quite something."
1165,tt1452293,5,"""Hexe Lilli: Die Reise nach Mandolan"" tells the story of the young witch Lilli, who is called to the far kingdom of Mandolan in order to free the throne from an evil curse. When Lilli finds out that she's just being used, not only the fate of Mandolan is at risk.The movie is mainly produced for children, some of which are already great fans of the franchise. What they find is a very colorful, exotic world that strongly reminds of India, a hero they can identify with and a good sense of humor. On the other hand the film desperately tries to make some more grown up gags in order to keep the parents entertained and unfortunately that fails massively and only leads to worn out or mediocre gags.All in all this movie has some elements that make for a good childhood film but at some points it is to conventional to stand out."
1166,tt1452293,4,"""Hexe Lilli: Die Reise nach Mandolan"" is a German film from 2011, so this one had its 5th anniversary last year and it is the sequel to another Hexe Lilli film from two years earlier. Alina Freund plays the title character in both and as she is turning 20 these days I guess you could say that there will not be another film about this character and the series ends as a duology just like Bibi Blocksberg did, another duology for kids here focusing on another witch, certainly an even more famous little sorceress. Okay back to this one here. If you take a look at the cast list you will find some known names like Tarrach playing one of the two antagonists or Mendl, Hagen and Kling. Michael Mittermeier reprises his voice acting role and Oscar winner Javier Bardem's mother Pilar is on board again too, even if her screen time is definitely limited. And while most of the performances were pretty okay I guess, including the child performance in the lead, I must say that the story here is probably just not good enough for another film. For example, they made very little of the interesting plot point that Lilli was far away from home and the friendship she strikes with a local boy simply isn't enough, especially as the title of the film really advertises this journey. There is zero character development in Lilli and everybody else. I have not read the original book by the writer going with the alias of Knister, so I am not sure if the original work was the problem or if it was the adaptation. The director probably wasn't as this one moved from Ruzowitzky to Sicheritz and this means we have two of Austria's most known in charge of this duology, names that you would not necessarily expect making kids films if you take a look at some of the other stuff they did. Anyway, overall this one was not a satisfying watch from the comedy or adventure approach and I suggest you skip it unless you really totally loved the first. It was the right decision they didn't make a third."
1167,tt1305591,7,"I wasn't going to watch this movie at all because of the terribly low score (4) on IMDb. Luckily, my kids talked me into it, and I was very pleasantly surprised indeed.I am amazed that this movie scored so low. Yes, granted, its nothing groundbreaking; there are plenty of well-worn formulas applied. But its far from unusual in this regard, and the story is full of fun situations and characters.Visually, its very nice to look at, and I found myself thoroughly enjoying the time I spent watching it. So did my kids, 8 and 10, who both thought it was great! I don't usually review movies here, but I often check the ratings before watching films. In this instance, I am amazed at the low rating this film received, and feel its unrepresentative of the actual quality.So 7/10 from me, and really at a loss as to how almost 30% of viewers could have possibly thought 1/10 was a fair rating!"
1168,tt1305591,7,"This seems to be a movie that people either enjoy or virulently hate. I am one of those who enjoyed the movie and I am mystified by the virulence directed against it. Yes, it was a little long and obvious at times but the animation was simply gorgeous, especially the cave sequence. One poster said the animation was ""too good"" and felt that animation should look more cartoony. I think the value of animation, even if it is ""too good"", is that you can do things with animation that you could not otherwise do. And as other posters have said, this movie is actually about something. It is about the importance of having a mother and father raise their children. Because of the title, some posters seem to have missed that the movie is about the importance of having fathers as well. Think of how the Martian fathers ended up in the movie. The movie also touches on the difficulties of raising children and on the dangers of the modern move towards ""efficiency"" and outsourcing tasks to machines. The movie seems aimed at kids with the sometimes overdone Gribble character but I think the movie is more interesting to older audiences. I saw it with my parents and we all enjoyed it. We are long-time science fiction fans and we loved the science fiction aspects and the lovely scenes of Mars. I am usually disappointed by Mars movies but I liked this Mars movie the best. It was like Avatar Meets Mars. It wasn't perfect but it was lovely."
1169,tt1305591,6,"I saw it with two of my little cousins and i was not looking forward to it atall after hearing how it bombed in box office and everyones reviews were really bad. It turns out I kinda liked it, the animation was very cool in 3D, which it must be seen in 3D or not nearly as cool.It was simple family friendly entertainment, very vibrant and original with very creative digital technology behind it. It was fast paced and kept the kiddies smilin'. More than I was expecting definitely, and overrall not that bad, I would definitely recommend if you are looking for a film to bring some kids to. As a small bonus at the end they shows behind the scenes of how they filmed it with live action actors, very cool."
1170,tt1305591,8,"Easily the biggest flop of 2011, and pretty close to of all time, this Disney motion-capture film is about a young boy, Milo, who must save his mother (Joan Cusack) from Martians. In Martian society, females rule the world. They discard the males (who then live on the trash-strewn surface world) and the females are raised by nanny-bots. They need the Earth mothers in order to program these nanny-bots, and the process they use leaves the Earth mothers dead. With the help of another human (Dan Fogler), who was brought up to Mars in the same fashion as Milo (trying to rescue his own mother, he stowed away on their ship), and a rebellious female Martian (Elisabeth Harnois), Milo sets out to save his mother. A lot of viewers get stuck on the film's gender politics. I admit they do seem a little backward, especially with the shrill, feminist stand-in villain (played by Mindy Sterling, whom you may remember as Frau Farbissina from the Austin Powers movies). However, I think that Ki, the Martian girl who helps Milo, is a positive enough female character that she should make up for the villain (the remainder of the female Martians are more or less faceless soldiers). If you can get past that stuff, the film is actually a lot of fun. Simple and straightforward, but a lot of fun. It's fast paced and beautiful to look at (thankfully, now that it's on video, you don't have to see the colors diminished in 3D), and it's very funny. Fogler and Harnois are both very good. Fogler's character, Gribble, is easily the best looking motion capture character I've ever seen. Gribble is an 80s kid and Ki has fallen in love with humanity after watching sitcoms about hippies, so they both talk in idioms from those eras, bugging modern kid Milo the whole time. I think most kids will love this movie, and it imparts a nice moral (respect your damn mother!). This fits in with the late crop of severely undervalued Disney films of the past several years, which includes The Princess and the Frog and Meet the Robinsons. None of these films are masterpieces or on par with Pixar's best, but they're excellent films nonetheless."
1171,tt1305591,7,"Mars Needs Moms (2011): Dir: Simon Wells / Voices: Seth Green, Dan Fogler, Elisabeth Harnois, Joan Cusack, Tom Everett Scott: Family animated space movie about the importance of mothers. It regards young Milo who constantly disobeys his mother. When his mother is abducted by martians Milo's struggle to rescue her. Apparently the abducted moms have their memories erased and entered into robot nannies that discipline the orphaned martians. Milo is assisted in his rescue mission by Gribble, a free spirited human whom lives in hiding. They are soon joined by Ki, a female martian who has adapted English and has a knack for colour. A triumph for director Simon Wells who also collaborated in another animated masterpiece called The Prince of Egypt. The animated detail is spectacular especially given movements, gestures and expressions of the characters. Seth Green voices Milo who must put his rebellious streak aside despite the fact that he will predictably learn his lesson. Dan Fogler voices Gribble whose spirit is sheltering his own failed attempt to rescue his mother. Now he has a new mission that will pay off by film's end. Elisabeth Harnois voices Ki who learns of emotion and love while assisting Milo with his mission. Joan Cusack voices Milo's mother who is placed within the dimwitted nanny-bot memory erased plot scheme, but whose rescue visualizes the bond between mother and son. Tom Everett Scott voices Milo's father and that is about the extent of his role. Underrated family film that is for anybody who needs a reminder of how important their mother is. Score: 7 ½ / 10"
1172,tt1305591,9,"I wasn't expecting this at all. I really wasn't. I hadn't read the bad reviews, however I saw the trailer and figured it would be quite cheesy and probably lame. Oh no aliens took my mother and I have to stop them! Sounded like a cheesy cartoon which would involve shooting aliens and running around to find his mom and save her, yada yada yada.Well... boy was I surprised.The movie started out with the whole alien world and because I knew the title was Mars needs Moms it implied the aliens were looking for moms. I watched them show two moms who's kids weren't listening, then it showed a third one who minded his mom. Satisfied by this result, it shows the boy and his mom and how the boy is in that age where he doesn't know why he should listen to his mom. Before they go to bed he says he wishes he didn't have a mom. The emotion from that makes you feel so bad.Now many scenes later the mom got abducted by the aliens, and the boy managed to hitch a ride and meets some new friends and learns a lot. By the time the ending comes you really hope he can save his mom. The emotions I felt were amazing. More amazing though was the fact that I eve got some nears near the end. I won't say what happens, but it was very emotional and powerful to me.So I would recommend this movie to anyone. And I'm 18 for your information, so hearing that a young adult got tears from a movie like this must be something.Rated 8/10."
1173,tt1305591,6,"It's not the most brilliant movie I've ever seen but it's not the worst one either. I enjoyed the animation except for the way Milo's face ""feels"". I'm not sure what it is, but I had the same thing while watching Polar Express: the kids don't really have childlike faces which makes it difficult for me to become attached to the characters. I would have liked to see more humor in this movie. The only part that I thought was actually funny and sort of cute was in the end, when the bug-like pet (Tuka??) went ""ew, ew"" when walking on grass for the first time. I don't think this movie is suitable for small kids because some parts are pretty creepy. For instance, when Gribble is captured by the Martians, he ends up in a public execution place in front of a fire squad where there are remains of the previous victims. Also, there's the message that when you're a good kid, Martians will come to take your mom away to do horrible things to her.(Oh, and why do men become dumb, sloppy creatures and why aren't they capable of creating the same sort of ""intelligent"" society as the females did when left without the presence of the opposite sex? I'm all for girl power but this really bothered me.)"
1174,tt1305591,7,"The average rating for this movie by professional film critics is about 3.0 out of 5 stars. That average is realistic. I would probably give it 6.5 out of 10 if I could, but I didn't feel it was as bad as movies I've given 6 out of 10 stars, so I gave it a 7 out of 10.The movie uses motion-capture computer animation to apply more realistic textures and movements to its characters, following movies like A Christmas Carol (which wasn't as good), Beowulf (which was much better), and The Polar Express (also much better).Mars Needs Moms features a plot that wasn't demographically targeted correctly. It features a boy who needs to rescue his mother from awkwardly humanoid-looking Martians, but boys that age are working very hard to separate themselves from needing their mothers. It is a very natural consequence of a male's life. So while the movie might appeal to mothers, I'm not sure it will appeal to boys.The next problem, which exacerbates the previous one, is its timing. The studio made a big, big mistake trying to release it at the same time as Battle: Los Angeles, and only a week after Rango. Parents already took their kids to Rango the weekend before, and the dads really wanted to see Battle: Los Angeles (especially after being sorely disappointed with the similarly themed Skyline last Fall).A lot of movies in January through March have been juggled around recently, causing all sorts of problems. Many movies were yanked from their original release dates and moved out later in the year. But Mars Needs Moms should have been released in early January. It would have fared a lot better. As it is, the movie has been a complete disaster at the Box Office. I fault Disney for the poor release strategy (they were only the distributor, not the actual producer of the movie), and Simon Wells for the rest.There is also the point that a lot of viewers were troubled by the Martians themselves. I think Simon Wells could have had his animators design them a little more intelligently. They seemed awkward to me -- they were humanoid, but slightly differenced to a degree that some people found disagreeable: legs too far apart, butts too big, and legs like they were inflated with air. Mr. Wells also made the mistake of giving the male Martians dreadlocks-like hair, which has accidentally incited a lot of racist remarks, although racial nods was not intended. (People really need to stop being oversensitive. Grow some skin, please!)There is an army of people flaming the movie, however, and the computer animation is at the core of their argument, which is very curious. One critic said, ""Mars Needs Moms stands as the potentially final Zemeckis-produced motion-capture effort, and, like The Polar Express, Beowulf, and A Christmas Carol before it, its characters boast the waxy complexions, unreal movements, and dead eyes of mannequins..."" (Nick Schager, The Village Voice)What the...? I'm confused here. What standard is this critic holding computer animated features to? I don't recall any waxy complexions or unreal movements or dead eyes of mannequins in any of these movies, or at least nothing that distracted me from the otherwise near photo-realistic computer animation that has only been around a few years. While they fall short of the realism of characters inserted into live action movies such as Peter Jackson's King Kong and Gollum, or George Lucas's Yoda in Star Wars episodes II & III, and certainly not the characters in Avatar, it didn't strike me as being a requirement in an animated feature to be THAT photo-realistic. Nobody complained about Shrek's movements being unrealistic or his eyes being dead as a mannequins, but clearly Shrek isn't being held to the same animation standard. What gives?While I'm not going to defend Mars Needs Moms on every point, I don't understand the beating its taking from reviewers here at IMDb. It's a fairly average film from a director who isn't very good to begin with, with plotting that could have been better and could have been worse, and some character design that could have been more intelligent. But unfortunately there seems to be a subculture out there (probably made up of mostly teens, and maybe even competing film marketers and computer animation folk -- perhaps some Rango promoters attempting to keep its returns high in the second week) who are throwing one stars around IMDb with malignant glee. To give 1 out of 10 stars to this movie is dishonest, and an abuse of having a rating system in the first place. There were 404 people who gave A Bug's Life ""1 star"" for example, and 3,284 who gave Shrek ""1 star."" And so forth. Movies need to be rated with some perspective on similar movies.Mars Needs Moms has some redeeming values. Not nearly as witty as Tangled or Shrek, but easier to understand and more enjoyable than Rango, which seemed to bore my two boys (4 and 7) whereas Mars Needs Moms entertained them. In all fairness, Rango was intended for slightly older children than mine, but I'm a pretty old child myself, with a lot more filmmaking, movie-going, and storytelling experience than the average IMDb reviewer, and I didn't find Rango nearly as brilliant as Johnny Depp's ground-worshipers claim.My advice to you, if you haven't seen Mars Needs Moms, is ask your kid if he or she is interested, and if so, take them. Forget about what you hear about it on IMDb boards, it's likely tainted."
1175,tt1305591,7,"I was tempted to see this movie in theaters, but I never got to convince anyone I knew to see it. Later, I was rather surprised to read it bombed. Sure, its plot sounded weak, but I didn't think it was THAT terrible.So, after seeing it, I say liked it. It does has it's problems, but the movie has a heart, and it does touch your inner child.I'm not crazy over Zemeckis' motion capture style, as, particularly in this movie, most of the characters are introduced as rather anonymous and not memorable.The movie does start off very weak, with a thin introduction to the characters (there are hardly any close-ups of both Milo or his mom) and the action. However, about halfway through the movie, the story finally gets into shape. Gribble's character was annoyingly presented at first, but once you know his back story, you can actually feel for him. Ki also starts off very badly, and her own back story is rushed, making the opposite mistake that was made with Gribble.Performances in this type of movies are rather irrelevant, so Seth Green's contribution might have been great as seen live, but in the movie it gets lost with all the visuals. Dan Fogler and Joan Cusack are functional, but their voice tone doesn't really mesh well with the style of the movie.The animation and effects are nice, though a little too reminiscent of Wall-E and TRON: Legacy, so it does kind of feel very derivative. Also of note is John Powell's entertaining underscore.As a whole, the plot starts off late, but it does grow in the telling. The movie isn't the worst ever made, it just happened to have the worst of luck during the season, which happens very often most of the times. Expect as an entertaining experience, and nothing else."

But Supervisor will give her best efforts to stop Milo and his friends. ""Mars Needs Moms"" is a delightful underrated animation about that crazy love thing and a tribute to the mothers and to the families. There is no explanation of how the Martians breed but the wonderful story can be easy enjoyed by those that have the concept of family, and not hatchery. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Marte Precisa de Mães"" (""Mars Needs Moms"")"
1177,tt1605790,4,"Unlike Hollywood, our Indian film Industry doesn't have many production houses backing children films with a decent budget. And the box office result of last few such films surely remains one big reason for that limited interest of Bollywood. So when Disney Films backs up a project made around a Children super hero Zokkomon, then one is bound to expect something great or extraordinary from the world famous pioneers of the genre.But once again the final result comes out to be far less than expected and the present project too is not capable of making any huge storm at the box office. In simple words, the film is not anything great but is not very bad either and is better than many sun-standard projects earlier churned out in the name of children films. Director Satyajit Bhatkal gives the right feel and look to the film along with some good visible production values. But if only he had given more time and stress upon the script, then the film could have been a rage among the kids.In a super-hero film the story is quite obvious that a person will get some super powers and then he will fight with all the cunning people and law breakers out there in a different outfit. But here the first drawback of the movie is that its main story plot borrows heavily from the one we have already seen in a well made children film by Vishal Bhardwaj, MAKDEE. Secondly, it takes too much time to bring in the super hero on the screen which should not be the case in such a film. And lastly though the super-hero sequences have been shot well but still they are not so entertaining or amusing for the kids to have a blast.However, a major and intelligent difference in the film is that the super-kid here doesn't have any illogical super natural powers, but he actually gets all those capabilities from the scientific gadgets designed by the 'Magic Uncle' living in the haunted house. But unfortunately the director doesn't give you any acceptable explanations for the gadgets made and thus they remain very questionable and un- convincing throughout. Further, a children film should essentially have very few but good hummable songs which ZOKKOMON doesn't. Moreover I am also strongly against using any death, dead body or cremation scenes in a children film creating some uneasy situations for the parents.Performance wise, Darsheel Safary perfectly portrays his role of a super-kid and looks confident along with Anupam Kher as always impressive in a double role. In fact many viewers may not even recognize him in his second role of the Magic Uncle. But the conviction with which he performs all his roles is indeed highly appreciable. Manjari Fadnis as Darsheel's Kittu Didi looks fresh and charming on the screen performing well. Tinnu Anand is fine in his routine kind of role and the kids supporting as Darsheel's friends are pleasant and appealing.On the whole, ZOKKOMON does have its own share of weak points and is not anything great offered in the genre of super-hero films. Still looking at its fine production values and good enjoyable performances you can watch it with your kids but preferably after its official DVD release."
1178,tt1605790,8,Just saw Zokkomon on Netflix - This film is worth a watch as it has a decent plot. You'll not be disappointed and you'll get to learn something from this film as well. It's a 👍 from me.

1181,tt0926129,1,"...let me count the ways.1. A title-only 'remake' that pulls out every cliché in the slasher handbook.2. A plot so predictable that it becomes quite pathetic.3. A completely weak execution of all attempts at suspense or thrills.4. A PG-13 rating that insures no gore, violence, or sex.5. A villain that is not frightening or even mysterious.6. A cast of characters that are so thinly written and stereotyped that we couldn't possibly care about them.7. A lack of any effectively creepy atmosphere (much unlike the original Prom Night).8. A script of dialog that's beyond poor - it's mind numbing. 9. A series of cardboard performances (not sure whether to blame the actors or the lousy aforementioned script for that).10. A completely inept teen-targeted slasher remake that's not brave enough to attempt to have an imagination - or even to show a puddle of blood.It's a no-brainer horror fans, save your money.BOMB out of ****"
1182,tt0926129,1,"Prom Night is shot with the artistic eye someone gives while finely crafting a Lifetime original film. You know the one. This October, Lifetime takes a break from the courageous tale of a woman surviving (insert disease name here) to tell the somewhat creepy tale of a woman pursued by a stalker ex-boyfriend. It's dramatic  it's sappy  it's immensely dull. It does nothing to further a genre, tell an original story, or strive for ANY sort of newness. Prom Night shares this plight. Watching the killer poke holes in his victims, we sit silently as they slump to the floor with not a drop of blood spilled. It occurred to me that this was the cleanest killer in movie history.Our director is working with a fairly good-looking killer so he is forced to pour on the camera angles to make him appear creepier. Think about Matthew McConaughey coming at you with a knife. You'd probably go  ""OH! Good lookin guy is going to kill me? Naaaa."" Not scary even for a second, so the director throws Schaech into shadows and over the shoulder in the mirror. This mirror shot is repeated to the point of sickness as it practically becomes a fetish of the creator. You'll get 15 jump scares in this film, 2 of which made my date jump (I might mention she is afraid of EVERYTHING). I'd also mention she decided to take a nap halfway through the film and at one point threatened to leave me.As if this film were not disjointed enough, it appears to be cut to shreds. I'm not saying it looks like key points were left on the cutting room floor as the crew scrambled to salvage some semblance of a horror film; I'm saying as the film moves from scene to scene, you often get a jarring jump. This is the kind of thing you'd expect when a film catches fire and a projectionist is forced to splice ends together, cross his fingers, and hope for the best. The editor should be shot.With a plot you can pack into two sentences, one stray spray of blood, an emo killer, and the tension of a very special episode of ""Silver Spoons"", we're left with no reason to support horror this weekend  at least on the big screen. In fact, this is the sort of film that should be punished. Is it really that hard to make a scary movie? Was this crew even aware they were making a horror film??!! A complete waste of my time and yours. I bit the bullet to get you this review. Don't let my sacrifice be in vain. DON'T GO INTO THE MOVIE!!!"
1183,tt0926129,1,"Good grief I can't even begin to describe how poor this film is. Don't get me wrong, I wasn't expecting much to begin with. Let's face it, a PG-13 slasher flick is pre-destined to be missing the ummm... slashing, so no one should be surprised by the lack of gore. But it was the level of incompetence and cliché on display in all the other aspects of this movie is what really blew me away. We have a protagonist who is quite simply so completely useless that you find yourself rooting for the bad guy. And here's a turnup for the books... SHE NEVER CHANGES - hence breaking the cardinal rule of basic screen writing - character development. If you think by the end of this film the poor little girl is going to turn around and finally kick some arse then think again. On top of this, we're handed possibly the least intriguing (and definitely the least scary) killer ever to grace the genre. I'm not joking when I say that Dora the Explorer has scarier villains than this movie.Finally, because all the potential for tension or gratuity is removed by the inept (and apparently thirteen-year-old) director, what could possibly be left to fill up 2 hours of screen time? Closets, that's what. Lots and lots of closets: big closets, small closets, mirrored closets, closets to Narnia, so many damned closets you'll not want to dress yourself for another year. In fact this movie should have just been called ""CLOSET"", and had a picture of a big scary coathanger on the DVD case. On the back it could have had a photograph of the audience falling asleep and a quote by Roger and Ebert - something to the extent of: ""what the f*@! did we just waste our time watching!"""
1184,tt0926129,3,"In Bridgeport, the deranged high school teacher Richard Fenton (Johnathon Schaech) is obsessed by the teenager student Donna Keppel (Brittany Snow); she witnesses him murder her family to stay with her, but Richard is arrested and sent to prison for life. Three years later, the traumatized Donna is feeling better but is still under psychological treatment and taking pills. On her prom night, she goes with her boyfriend Bobby (Scott Porter) and two couples of friends to the Pacific Grad Hotel for the party. But the psychopath Richard has escaped from prison and is lodged in the same floor in the hotel chasing Donna, stabbing her friends and staff of the hotel that cross his path.The forgettable slash ""Prom Night"" is a collection of clichés with a total lack of originality. The stupid story is shallow and silly, with a bad acting of Johnathon Schaech in the role of an insane killer. The predictable screenplay is amazing since it is possible to foresee what is going to happen in the next scenes. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): ""A Morte Convida Para Dançar"" (""The Death Invites to Dance"")"
1185,tt0926129,2,"When I first saw the trailer for Prom Night, I have to admit, the trailer looked good and like this would be a fun horror movie. So my friend and I saw Prom Night last night and I have to say I must be growing up because this was such a ridicules film, not to mention I am so sick and tired of the typical horror slasher movies with the loud noises as an excuse to scare people. There was no tension, the characters, how was I supposed to care about them? They had no development what-so-ever, the killer?! Oh, my God, this was very possibly the most stupid serial killer that has ever existed, I know it's a film, but why would a man who never(or at least we know of) killed any one before, kill a girl's family and friends that he's just obsessed over? I mean, was he going to kidnap her or was he going to kill her? I have no idea, because this film made no sense and is too predictable and insulting to true fans of horror.Donna's family was just brutally murdered by her teacher, who has become very obsessed over her, he was captured and put in jail. It's been 3 years and she's just now getting some peace in her life, she's even going to her senior prom. But the killer has escaped and still has Donna on his mind, he follows her to her prom which means bad news for her friends, and the hotel maid, and the bell boy, because it is such a good idea to kill the maid and bell boy so no one become suspicious enough to check to see where these employee's are. Donna is in big trouble because also this killer who is clearly human can apparently get into houses un-noticed and can kill people so silently, just, wow.I'm sorry, I really did want to love this movie, we haven't had a good slasher flick in a long time, but this was just a stupid movie that I was not impressed with. Just the situations were unbelievable and the actors were obnoxious. I know that this was a PG-13 movie, but I just love how someone was brutally stabbed to death and they only have just a little blood on their clothes? Not to mention no stab holes? I wouldn't recommend this movie for anyone unless you're a teen, this movie was made for the teenagers, not adults, and not for those who know a real horror movie, no offense to those who did enjoy this film, but I don't understand how anyone could.2/10"
1186,tt0926129,2,"I'm not particularly fond of remakes, or to steal the modern jargon ""retellings"", but this film truly peeved me off. The original Prom Night, while not in my humble estimation a masterpiece, still realized what it was... horror. There are some simple things to remember when making a horror film. Suspense is crucial to maintaining the interest of the audience. Sorry folks, but a white knuckle film this was not! The scares were cheap, and foreshadowed terribly. (A good example of scare which has been done to clichéd excess now, is the cat jumping out of the closet, followed soon there after but a now unexpected appearance by the villain of the film) This film couldn't successfully pull that off, so how could I expect it to fulfill any of the other conventions of horror film. There needs to be a likable hero or heroine. This film doesn't have one. The person I most identified with was the head detective. His calm demeanor, but level headed approach to the escape of a killer was what more films of this ilk should have. Common sense approach to events that occur. (If you're running from an Axe wielding psycho, you turn and sprint in the opposite direction. Not jog, whilst looking back ever three seconds, gaging the killer's progress, only to trip over every branch and inanimate object in your path.) If you friend disappears, you don't go looking for them alone. And if you suspect foul play you tell someone, not investigate yourself. These clichés are tired and well overplayed. In the horror genre in general, and in this film in particular."
1187,tt0926129,2,"I am the guy who usually keeps opinions to himself, but I just got back from this movie, and felt I had to express my opinions. Let me start by saying that I am a HUGE horror fan. But what makes a horror movie? I sure like to see even a tiny bit of a good script and character development. I know they often lack in horror movies, but Prom Night looked like it didn't even put forth ANY effort in that department. Next, we all love suspense. That on the edge of your seat suspense with unpredictable surprises. Yeah, Prom Night had none of that! Of course, we like a terrifying killer. Prom Night have that? Nope, it has a pretty boy with a cute lil' knife. And when all else fails...at least horror has its guilty pleasure to make it enjoyable like gore gore gore, and the occasional nude scene! Yeah, well when you have a horror movie rated PG-13 like Prom Night, they leave that stuff out too. So with all of these elements missing, I ask....does this still count as a horror movie? Nope. I'd call it more of a comedy. People in my theater were laughing more at this then they were when I saw ""Semi-Pro"" that was supposed to actually be a comedy (which also sucked, but thats another story!). I think I am just going to have to give up on new horror. All the good horror movies of the good ol' days have been remade into garbage so movie studios can make money. The people I went to see it with didn't even know this was a remake! Which made me mad! I wonder what will happen when there's no more movies to remake??? Where will horror go next???"
1188,tt0926129,1,"Poor acting, no script, no plot, no convincing killer, no suspense, no original setups, it uses the same closet/under the bed/person-behind-you-in-the-mirror tactics over and over again making it repetitive and boring, and NOT in a foreshadowing way either, and the fact that NOBODY ever ""really"" gets killed (at least not on screen) , which in turn zaps any suspense it may invoke right out of it and makes everyone feel eve MORE cheated for spending money on their admission ticket....its a horror film w/o any horror LMAO. The MOST you see is what looks like someone having taken a ketchup bottle and spraying it across a plastic sheet.You have to be a teen who was sitting there screaming in the theater and scaring yourself to have enjoyed this, or you were high/drunk at the time.Honestly, I have a life and don't bother writing reviews that often unless I really really hated something, or enjoyed it tremendously.But this film is AWFUL and I feel I have a duty of sorts to warn you NOT to give your money to Hollywood and encourage this kind of filmaking ever again! It is one thing to rent a ""bad"" movie at blockbuster from the Weinsteins, its another when you have to sit through it in a theater.Also, in case you want some remake nostalgia, forget it! This is NOT a remake, nor is it a re-imagining. It is not scary, nor engaging, nor is it satisfying enough to be ""funny"" like others on IMDb have claimed...it is just stale and booooring.Here is what you will take away from this film: remembering the scar on Brittany Snow's head that stands out more than the plot, the fact that Jonathan Schaech MUST be having some sexual affair with J.S. Cardone of ""The Forsaken"" to have gotten another role as a killer(because he is as frightening as my poodle, and too cute to kill just about anyone) and that for some reason (duh) everyone who goes back to the hotel suite never comes back. What kind of person would NOT get worried at the prom when they decide to announce the candidates for prom king and queen and the fiercely competitive girl just somehow doesn't show up? This is my warning to you. DO NOT waste you're money like I did. The ""original"" sucks too but is more of a guilty pleasure for Jamie Lee Curtis fans, though no way near as bad as this piece of crap (sorry to sound vulgar or rude, but once you see this, you will understand why I say what I say)."
1190,tt0926129,1,"Prom Night is about a girl named Donna (Brittany Snow) who is being chased by a psycho killer trying to kill her at her prom night. And by doing so killing her family, friends, and her enemies. Now before I begin let me say have you been tired of PG-13 horror movies that haven't been scary lately. Are you tired of stupid girl dialog 'Oh my god' and talking about girlish things. And are you really tired of girls in relationships and then crying. And the last thing are you tired of the US remaking Asian, Japanese, and Chinese films. That pretty much sums up Prom night but I'm still not done with the review.The only reason to see 'Prom night' is to crack a laugh at the kills. If not, don't see Prom night. You never see the kills an only hear screaming and you see some blood on the wall. And by the way the deaths are repeating like 24/7. So not only aren't they scary but it's obnoxious. By the time I met the cast I think I was ready to hurl. Too much girl talk, too much guy talk, and lots of 'Oh my gosh. It's our prom'. I understand it's fun but seriously is it too much to ask not to concentrate. If I were to put Prom Night on the list of worst films of 2008 without seeing the other films I'd be the first one too. I'm not going to be surprised if it gets released on DVD for cheap and quick. Seriously don't spend your money or the time for dull acting, cheap scares, and a 'Night to die for' when watching the film.1 star out of 10. (P.S. If I could give the film zero stars I would)."
1191,tt1298650,5,"The BadI'm sure my surroundings had a lot to do with my enjoyment of the film, or lack thereof, but even without that it wasn't up to the high standard that I regard the first three Pirates of the Caribbean films. The plot was flaky and apart from Jack, the characters weren't that great.After seeing Ian McShane in Deadwood I was convinced he'd make a fantastic Blackbeard, but I think his Lovejoy character was more evil than he was in On Stranger Tides. At the height of his devilishness (is that even a word?) he triggered his ship's flamethrower to kill a mutineer and gave us doubts over his true feelings to a daughter he'd only just found out about. He wasn't a patch on the Barbosa/Davey Jones/Lord Beckett trifecta of evil from the first three films. As someone once said, Luke Skywalker was only as good as Darth Vader was evil.Speaking of the daughter, Penelope Cruz as Angelica was a character I felt very apathetic towards. The whole raison d'etre of her quest to find the Fountain of Youth was because it had been foretold that a one legged man would kill her father and she wanted to save him so she could have that father she never heard. I'm sorry but pass me the bucket - that sentimental dross deserves to be on Jeremy Kyle (Oprah Winfrey for anyone reading from the US) not as the main plot for the latest of one of the biggest film franchises of all time.The dilemma at the end of the film sees both Blackbeard and Angelica about to die and only one can be saved by the Fountain of Youth. At that point I didn't care if either died and why should I? Blackbeard is an evil man, or so they tell us, and Angelica has used Jack to get to the Fountain of Youth. If I were Jack I'd have left them both to die and the film would have been better off if he had. At least then we'd have some of the darker side of Jack which never showed appeared in this film. Instead our scoundrel played a goody two shoes who seemed to be motivated by his concern for Angelica's safety. Please, this is Jack Sparrow we are talking about, like he really gives a damn about anyone apart from himself, a characteristic which made him so appealing in the previous films. Yes, he does have a softer side that we've seen before, but to not this whipped extent.Don't even get me started on the Mermaids. They were great to start with, but as soon as it was just Syrena and her boring relationship with Philip the clergyman, all was lost as they gave us the dullest moments in Pirates of the Caribbean history, to date.My last major moan is about the part where Jack left Angelica on the island. Remember, Angelica's whole motivation was to save her father, and Jack had just condemned him to death. So why in God's name, when his back was turned, did she try to attack him with a piece of wood and not shoot him in the back with the pistol he had just given her? Yes she had some feelings for Jack, but surely not enough for her to get over the fact that Jack had basically just killed her father and destroyed what she had spent the whole film trying to achieve? Don't give me the old 'he saved her life' spiel – Jack let Blackbeard , her father, die - end of story.The GoodWhilst nowhere near as funny as in the previous films Jack was still a great character, in spite of his wimpy attitude change. The scenes where he escaped from the King and the clutches of the Spanish were a reminder of how great Pirates of the Caribbean can be at its best. It was great to see Gibbs back alongside Jack as their chemistry is great and a nice link back my beloved first three films.As always, the film looked and sounded great, though the 3D wasn't essential and I found myself taking the glasses off from time to time and it made little difference. In fact I'd go as far as to say that while you lose depth in 2D, you gain richness in colour.I'm struggling to think of much else to compliment the film for and at the moment I'm stuck in my post viewing disappointment funk. I really need to watch it again but after my horrific cinema experience I'll wait until it comes out on Blu-ray."
1192,tt1298650,7,"Law and Order: Special Victims Unit is one of my favorite television shows, even though its gone a bit downhill lately. Is it the cast? No, because they are mostly intact. What is actually happening is that each of the main characters, known for their superb chemistry amongst each other, are suddenly spending less screen time with each other and more time to themselves. This story actually has a point. On Stranger Tides suffers the same fate: fantastic cast that don't spend as much time with each other as we hope. Add some pointless plot lines, a calmer first-third of the flick, and you have yourself the fourth installment of Pirates of the Caribbean.That being said, its still quite entertaining. On Stranger Tides follows a variety of people searching for the fabled Fountain of Youth. Unfortunately for us, its not just Jack Sparrow. We have Blackbeard, the Spanish, the British (led by Barbossa), Angelica, and more doing the same thing. Subplots pertaining to this quest include Jack's past with Angelica, Barbossa's questionable change in character, some random guy falling for some random girl (I am serious, this part was totally pointless), and the pointless Spanish people that flock in and out of the movie.This is by far the weakest part of the movie, the script. For some odd reason, they borrowed far too much from the novel (whose pacing and themes far differ that of the Pirates brand) and forgot that sometimes simplicity is best---which is what made Curse of the Black Pearl such a great film. It was the easiest to follow, and On Stranger Tides didn't learn from the previous two installments. To add to that, the script utterly separated everyone, even those with the best on-screen chemistry. Barbossa was barely with Jack Sparrow, Sparrow was rarely with his ex-lover, and worst of all reliable Gibbs spent minimal time with Sparrow. When they are together, the humor, the banter, tension, and the charm works well. When they aren't, well, the movie drags a bit.Thank goodness the cast is still on their game. Johnny Depp once again breathes life into the pirate movie with his smart, unpredictable, and hilarious portrayal of Jack Sparrow. Despite what the reviews say, Jack Sparrow's shtick isn't getting old as he is still a delight to watch. Geoffrey Rush once again shines as Jack's best rival Barbossa, as his quiet intentions resemble that of Sparrow in earlier films. Penelope Cruz adds a layer of sexuality that we definitely did not have with the other Pirates of the Caribbeans--it's just a shame she didn't have much time with Sparrow. Director Rob Marshall was able to shell out good performances from everyone in the cast, but he definitely wasn't the man for this job.Almost all the chase scenes or action sequences were done with very low-lighting and poor camera angles. With the exception of the mesmerizing and chilling mermaid sequence and the opening chase, all the action moments were missing that special touch. While the bizarreness of Gore Verbinski will not be totally missed (although his style worked perfectly in Rango), his ability to crank out excellent stuntwork and fights was sorely missing here. At least we got to see plenty of it, from the opening chase to the final dramatic (and short) showdown. Say whatever you want, but there has yet to be anything that can top the infamous three-way sword fight/old mill showdown from Dead Man's Chest.Bottom Line: Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides is a mix of frustration and fun. There was plenty of potential that wasn't met because of questionable plot lines, pointless moments, lack of chemistry (once again: writer's fault. Good going Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio), and uneven direction. All that banter aside, Pirates is also plenty fun with several delightful moments, funny lines, and much more action than the last Pirates flick. Johnny Depp, Penelope Cruz and company keep the movie afloat, and prevent it from being a pure bore. But I think the franchise works better when Verbinski is behind the camera. On Stranger Tides is decent summer entertainment, but doesn't have the inescapable magic and charm of the first two."
1193,tt1298650,9,"Firstly, this review does not contain any spoilers whatsoever so read on. I had the privilege to watch this in the El Capitan theater advanced screening. Johnny Depp, the goofy pirate that we have grown to love, returns to his iconic role of Captain Jack Sparrow in an action-packed tale of truth, betrayal, youth and demise.The plot is when Jack crosses paths with a woman from his past (Penelope Cruz), he's not sure if it's love—or if she's a ruthless con artist who's using him to find the fabled Fountain of Youth. When she forces him aboard the Queen Anne's Revenge, the ship of the formidable pirate Blackbeard (Ian McShane), Jack finds himself on an unexpected adventure in which he doesn't know who to fear more: Blackbeard or the woman from his past.By being a fan this franchise, I can happily confirm that YES, it is as good as the first one! Be ready for an adventure and half! Brings everything from the classic bizarre comedy to the nail biting action scenes.The marketing for the movie have been intelligently subliminal like some other great film releases, like Avatar, or Blair Witch (the real vs fake) and the recent awesome film production The Artifice (the-artifice.com) and so on.This is not a film to miss, does not matter if you are a die hard fan of Pirates, or new to the series! I might be in trouble for writing a review of the movie this early, so please click Yes on the ""is this review useful"" as a thank you ;)"
1194,tt1298650,8,"As far as the Pirates of the Caribbean movies go, On Stranger Tides may be lacking in the rollicking fun of Curse of the Black Pearl, which I absolutely loved, though it's closer in spirit to it than those of the two movies before, but I think it is better than Dead Man's Chest, which had great effects and a brilliant Bill Nighy but felt overlong and ferentic sometimes, and At World's End, which had the cast giving their all, great visuals, score and final battle but rather convoluted and bloated on the whole.On Stranger Tides isn't perfect. I did feel it did have perhaps have too many moments of exposition and clichés, though the story if slightly rickety in places here is less bloated noticeably and better paced than the film released before it which is a good thing. I also felt the romantic subplot(s) felt underdeveloped and forced, and while there are some droll, bizarre and witty quips particularly with Depp, Rush and Cruz there is a bit of filler that could have been excised.However, despite these complaints, On Stranger Tides is a worthy instalment. Once again, the production values are impeccable, the cinematography is skillful, the costumes, sets and period recreation is authentic and the effects are superb. The opening twenty minutes is an example of the writing being at its funniest and wittiest, and the scenes with the mermaids are beautifully shot and intriguing.While not perhaps original, and not among his best, I did very much like Hans Zimmer's score, which was rousing and brought some much-needed energy. The characters are not the best developed, but they are fun and there aren't too many of them to interrupt the flow of the story, a big problem I found with At World's End, while the action sequences are both exciting and nail-biting on the whole.I wasn't so sure about Rob Marshall as director, but he does a far better job than expected, and the film is livelier in pace than Dead Man's Chest and At World's End. The acting is good enough for what it was. Johnny Depp plays lovable rogue Jack Sparrow with a voluptuous swagger and sly humour and nails it again, while the idea to omit Kiera Knightley and Orlando Bloom here proved a good one, without them for my money the whole adventure carried less of a dead weight.Instead we have Penelope Cruz, who proves a perfect match for Depp. She is feisty, beautiful, foxy and sexy, and also likable and fun. I was wondering what they would do for villains without Bill Nighy, but I needn't have worried. Ian McShane is a worthy addition as Blackbeard, who is charming in a grizzly way while committing acts of great evil. Geoffrey Rush is underused in a way, but he does have some great lines and a fun presence so he isn't a complete waste.In conclusion, On Stranger Tides is not a perfect film, but as an instalment to a decent enough franchise it is a more than worthy one. And you know, what I've said about this movie was not something I thought I would be saying, because judging by what I'd seen of the advertising/trailers, it looked as though it was going be the worst of the series, but actually for me it wasn't. 7.5/10 Bethany Cox"
1195,tt1298650,7,"I saw an advanced screening of this movie last night at the El Capitan theatre in Hollywood. I don't want to give away any spoilers, so all I'll say is that it was pretty darn good. By not having Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom in it, the film didn't feel like just a rehash of all the other PotC films. Penelope Cruz and Ian McShane really added a lot to the film, and I loved Sam Claflin's performance. But of course you have to have Johnny Depp, because it wouldn't be PotC without him, and Geoffrey Rush was spectacular as always. All in all, this has everything you'd expect from PotC: swashbuckling, sea creatures, sword-fighting, and lots of great comedy; but the new cast members keep it feeling fresh."
1196,tt1298650,7,"After a four-year hiatus to regroup and determine the future of the franchise, Disney and what was once its surprise mega-hit ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" series have returned in ""On Stranger Tides."" Hard to believe that this franchise evolved from the once-lambasted concept of a theme park ride being turned into a successful motion-picture blockbuster. After exhausting the ""Pirates"" world with two back-to-back sequels of titanic and rather disappointing proportion in 2006 and 2007, a break in the action to recalibrate Captain Jack Sparrow's compass was much-needed. The ""new"" course set by ""On Stranger Tides"" uses worn sails, but with a fresh wind of characters and more importantly, a more direct purpose.As promised in the end of ""At World's End,"" Jack's looking for the Fountain of Youth if for nothing more than ships and giggles. First, however, he must take a side trip to London to rescue his old pal Gibbs (Kevin McNally) and subsequently the palace of King George (Richard Griffiths in a lovely cameo). There, he learns that his old pal Barbossa (Rush) has lost The Black Pearl as well as his leg and sold out to His Majesty's Royal Navy. He is to help the English find the Fountain before the Spaniards do. Jack, of course, knows the way there, thus continuing his ongoing role as an indispensable pestilence.After a familiar improvised escape, he crosses paths with an old lover, Angelica (Penelope Cruz), who he once deflowered before she was to take her vows at a convent. She mentions she has a ship he can borrow, only it turns out that it's her father's ship, the Queen Anne's Revenge, captained by none other than Blackbeard the Pirate (Ian McShane), a feared and soulless scourge with a minor in black magic. So much for smooth sailing.As overdone and cliché as the Fountain of Youth may be, it's perfect for the ""Pirates"" franchise and helps keep things very simple, something the last installment had more than a fair deal of trouble with. Only a few character subplots threaten to convolute the story, but all motivations lead to the Fountain regardless the reason. In fact, ""On Stranger Tides"" marks the first film to truly focus on Captain Jack. With Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley's characters out of the way, the franchise can keep the spotlight on the reason it's gotten four films deep. Depp has nothing new in store for us as the true center of attention, but by continuing to underplay the trademark quirks and mannerisms, he continues to prolong the deterioration of the Capt. Jack act. Some might disagree, but it depends how much you liked him the first place.In terms of new faces, Ian McShane is impeccable as Blackbeard. Rush gave a wonderfully theatrical performance as the main villain in the first film, but McShane introduces the first true quantifiable force of evil the franchise has seen. Although his voodoo abilities and reputation for killing his men and bringing them back from the dead to serve as his zombie slaves are never entirely realized, he's the merciless villain this film needed. He never fully crosses into scare-your-children evil, but he could've at any instant and that feeling radiates from his performance. In general, this film aligns itself more with fantasy and traditional folklore than the supernatural like the previous film.Among other new faces, Rob Marshall as the franchise's new director does serviceable work. The ""Chicago"" filmmaker chews the scenery well and creates effective moods and tones, but the action could have been a bit more inspired, especially considering the series' reputation for sword-fighting ingenuity.Marshall's best work and the film's best sequence deals with mermaids, not the singing and seashell bra type, but seduce you with their looks and then try and devour you with fangs type. Quiet, suspenseful and culminating in a full-on action sequence, the mermaids constitute the one completely fresh element of the film. Their cove is the lone stop on the journey as well, so it's the only aspect of the plot that creates that classic seafaring adventure feeling akin to Homer's ""The Odyssey.""Not much else deviates from the formula, so those hoping for a resurgence in the series or something as good as the first film, ""The Curse of the Black Pearl,"" will remain wishful thinkers once again. It's hard to imagine where the series could go next without retreading over old ground or just introducing new characters for the sake of it, but Captain Jack Sparrow remains one of the few reliable comforts of blockbuster cinema, and any adventure with him at the wheel will struggle to be a total waste of time. ""On Stranger Tides"" makes just enough adjustments to the series to make for a successful installment.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com"
1197,tt1298650,5,"So after a 4 year hiatus Disney decides to bring back Captain Jack Sparrow. A huge fan of the first one and moderately enjoyed the second one and confused by the third one I was ready to see a fresh crew for the this new installment. The films opening scene was fantastic. It was fun and creative and really captured the essence of the Jack Sparrow that we love. It kept going for a bit. The first 20 minutes of the movie were the most exciting and fun parts of the movie except for one scene which I feel may be second best scene in all the Pirates films. The infamous addition of mermaids was the best part in the entire film. It was very reminiscent of the powerful underwater march of the dead from the first film. Lets move onto the acting. Most of it was decently solid but Ian McShane as the villain, Black Beard stole the show. He actually seemed like the only one who cared to make the film interesting. Another newcomer to the series was Penelope Cruz. She was nothing fantastic but completely necessary to bring in a much needed sex appeal to the film. Geoffrey Rush returned as Barbosa, I felt he was very confused as to if he was a bad guy or good guy which caused his acting to seem very indifferent. There were a few scenes that you knew he was having fun but otherwise he was just a drag. And of course Johnny Depp reprized his role as the witty fun loving Captain Jack Sparrow. Again he had his moments just like Barbosa that were fun and creative but he even came up a little lackluster in certain scenes. The story was super simple, which I guess is understandable considering the convoluted mess of 2 and 3.There was an unnecessary sub plot that never got resolved, which I wish they spent a little more time on and made it a little darker. I am not going to spoil anything though, but you will see what I am talking about when you see the film. As you wait for the scene after the credits you want it to be the conclusion to this sub plot but nope. The climax could have been a bit more climatic and more exciting, but I guess they did what they could. Most of the action happens in the dark so I would not recommend the 3D transfer of it. I saw it in 2D and I thought the 3D wouldn't be worth it.Marshall did a mediocre job directing. It was nothing special and definitely not Gore Verbinski. The way the film turned out, it looked like the director was even bored while shooting. Positively though it is a summer blockbuster where your brain needs to be left at home and will be enjoyed by lovers of the series. It may not stay with you but for an hour and half of the movie out of the 2+ running time you will be enjoying yourself which I guess is not too bad.On initial reaction to the film I gave it a 7/10 because at the time it was enjoyable. Then I thought about it and the reason I almost fell asleep twice was not because it was late, it was because the story was boring and nothing was really happening in this lengthy piece of work. Therefore on second reaction it gets a 5/10. If they continue the series, which I am sure they will seeing as how this film will make bank over the weekend, they need to trim out the unnecessary sub plots that do nothing for the story except let it drag on and if anything bring back the gorgeous and creepy mermaids. Also have a little faith in the audience, you can make the plot a little bit more thought provoking instead of laying all the pieces in front of us and then watching you put them together after we already know how to do the puzzle in our head.

1198,tt1298650,8,"Boy, the way some people are acting on the web, you would think that Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides was the devil. I saw this movie opening day with pretty good expectations, because I love the Pirate movies, even if the third one is too complicated at times, I really enjoy these movies. Let's face it, we wouldn't have been brought back to the pirate genre if it wasn't for these movies. I agree that the plots should be more simple, but I don't mind a movie that challenges you along. I actually did love On Stranger Tides, even though it's not as good as the first one, I give much kudos for giving us something very fresh. Not to mention that it's shorter so I would think that more people would be pleased with that. But I think the cast still has it, Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow is always such a pleasure to watch on screen. He and Penelope Cruz really lit up the screen and brought life into the series. This is a fun summer blockbuster with scary moments, funny characters and a swash buckling good time.Captain Jack Sparrow travels to London to locate a person who has been impersonating him. The imposter has been recruiting a crew to search for the legendary Fountain of Youth. Jack is brought before King George, who wants him to guide an expedition to the Fountain of Youth before the Spanish find it. Heading the expedition is Jack's old nemesis, Captain Hector Barbossa, now a privateer in service to the British Navy after having lost Jack's ship, the Black Pearl, as well as his leg. Jack escapes, and is found by his father, who warns Jack about the Fountain's tests. Jack's imposter is Angelica, his former lover and daughter of the ruthless pirate Blackbeard , who possesses supernatural powers and practices voodoo magic. Jack is forced to join Blackbeard's crew and to lead them to the Fountain.When I was a kid I absolutely adored the old movies, especially pirate movies like Captain Blood or Jason and the Argonauts. So these movies bring back the good ol' days and the magic of seeing these effects back on the big screen. While I do think that they are a little much for some children, I think any adult could get into these movies. Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush have great chemistry and bring the pirates to life, I could only imagine the type of fun they have during these films.I know that not everyone is a fan of pirates, I don't know if maybe it's due to the fact that the films were released so closely together that people got sick of it, I'm not sure. But I think if given the fair chance, you'll really enjoy this movie. This one has mermaids in it and the actual way that the myth is told, Disney had softened it up with The Little Mermaid and now brought it back to the truth. A warning in advance, that is a very scary scene I'm pretty sure most kids wouldn't be able to handle. But I thought it was extremely cool and very well done with the special effects. I'm also glad that they didn't go the safe route with the love story between Johnny and Penelope. However I really got bored easily with the Christian missionary and his love story with the mermaid was predictable and I think was their way of trying to replace Orlando Bloom and Kiera Knightly. But I had a good time watching this movie and I'm pretty sure if you're looking for a good time going into it, you will have fun. I'm honestly looking forward to the next pirates movie.8/10"
1199,tt1298650,1,"Jack Sparrow, Barbossa and Mr. Gibbs are by far, the best combinations, they are the real comedians of this movie. I missed the rest of the Black Pearl's crew.Angélica doesn't show her role clearly and she has a pointless quest (save her father from death, who was predicted to be killed by one man that has a wood-leg ), somehow she could be lovely for some people and totally annoying for others.Blackbeard doesn't show his role also, he has a great first entrance and ""that's it""....then he moves between being an evil man and a scared old man.The cleric and mermaid's love story is totally forgettable and bad acted by the cleric mainly.The real problem of this movie is the lack of detail explanations... the Blackbeard's sword seems to be an important item, but its origin was never described (this role was played in the anterior movies by Pintel and Ragetti, giving details over every mythic character or legends) the same fact with Blackbeard , the lost of the Barbossa's leg just has a couple of lines without any image showing the event, even in ""racconto"" mode.In general lines, the movie lacks of story and details."
1200,tt1298650,1,"I have enjoyed most of the other Pirates of the Caribbean movies, but decreasingly so. Now, it seems with 3D, you do not have to have a movie which has a story, just a bunch of fight scenes, people fighting to win a race to get to the fountain of youth.Mr Rush was the only enjoyable thing about the movie. I am disappointed J Depp would sink to this kind of rubbish. There is LITERALLY no story, so it is hard to comment about it, but it is Hollywood in a very bad state when crap like this gets churned out as an excuse for entertainment.Special effects and 3D does not excuse having no character development/theme/intrigue etc... there just was nothing there other than 3D and FX trying to puff itself up into a worthwhile entity. MASSIVE FAIL."
1201,tt1216475,8,"I keep reading reviews for Cars 2 and I am kind of surprised. Some people went as far as comparing it to the Star Wars prequels. Sure, Cars 2 definitely is no ""Finding Nemo"" or ""Toy Story."" But it sure was fun, at least for me. The plot was an obvious reference to James Bond and Mission Impossible. I enjoyed the spy gadgets and political overtones. It was action-packed and not only enjoyable for little kids, but for older kids and adults too. Why all the hate? Heck, even Roger Ebert and Rolling Stone liked it!In my opinion, Cars 1 was a little slow. It dragged a little too long in certain parts. Cars 2 suffers from no such thing.To sum it up; Cars 2 may not be Toy Story but it sure is FUN and ENTERTAINING."
1202,tt1216475,7,"(Flash Review)Cars 2 switches tracks a bit from being based in a small town to world-wide jet setter and oddly Mater seems to take center stage in this film. This film plays out like a Bond film and Mater sort of like the Pink Panther (if I understand that character correctly) as someone who inadvertently gets in the way of criminals and their plans and sort of helps the secret agents along the way, while McQueen competes in worldwide races. As an automobile and racing fan, I loved this film as there were a plethora of fun, foreign and classic cars all mixed in along the way and the races mixed NASCAR, Formula 1, Rally, and other endurance sports cars; pretty neat. From a parent of a small child perspective, it was a little advanced for kids as there was a theme of big oil vs alternative fuels and a lot more guns and peril for a G Rated movie and from the first Cars. Overall, it was fun and exciting and amusing humor of Mater the rural bloke vs international high scale people."
1203,tt1216475,7,"We all know that Pixar makes incredible movies, I personally have never disliked a Pixar film. The first ""Cars"" film, was a great movie, not a perfect film. It was one of the least better films, Pixar has made, but that's like saying, Insomnia was one of Christopher Nolan's worst films. I had high expectations when coming to see the film, like I always have before I see a Pixar film.After my viewing of the film, I have to say Pixar never fails to produce a great, entertaining film. Although it doesn't reach the heights of Wall-E, Toy Story 3, etc. It still stands by itself pretty high up there. The animation is extremely well done, the look of the film is amazing. The voice actors are great, I miss Paul Newman though. Although the film is not perfect. The movie is not perfect though, the story is not great, but not bad, the movie does not have the emotional as other Pixar films, but it is definitely not a heartless film. But the film is definitely entertaining and a great beginning to 2011 Summer movie season. Take your whole family to see this movie, it will probably not disappoint. It will not only satisfy kids, but also the adults, this film is for everyone. Fun for kids, but the adults can also connect with it and will have a great time watching this movie in theaters. It is quite an adventure and I will be glad to give it a second viewing."
1204,tt1216475,3,"16 years ago, Pixar Animation Studios released the first feature length computer animated film in history, Toy Story. What followed was an incredible run of success, an 11 film hot streak that yielded dozens of awards (including 11 Oscars), billions of dollars in box office receipts, and the admiration of audiences and critics everywhere. Year after year Pixar was a company you could rely on, and while not all the films were perfect, they all were at least of decent quality, and light years ahead of their competition from the likes of Dreamworks and Sony. So therefore it's heart-breaking to say that Pixar's hot streak has come to a crashing halt in 2011. Cars 2 is not just the weakest film in Pixar's catalogue, it is the worst high-profile animated release for some time.If there is one Pixar film that divides opinion much more than any other, it is 2006's Cars. While by no means a bad film, it just didn't hit in the same way as films like Toy Story, Finding Nemo, or The Incredibles. It did middling numbers at the box office (by Pixar standards) and currently sits with a 74% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, the only film from the studio below 90%. For director John Lasseter (also head of Pixar), Cars is obviously a very personal film, a nostalgic story about the loss small-town American values in the face of increased modernity. If it's not a complete success, credit must be given to Lasseter for at least trying to say something meaningful, and in typical Pixar fashion the film stands out in the increasingly crowded computer animation film market for at least attempting thematic depth, and it's ability to reach audiences both young and old. Cars 2 on the other hand is completely devoid of depth and subtlety, and will more than likely annoy adults while at times being arguably inappropriate for children. Returning director Lasseter takes the worst character from the first film (in my opinion the biggest reason for Cars' failure), and structures the whole story around his infuriating exploits. Imagine George Lucas, upon seeing the negative feedback following The Phantom Menace, making all of Episode 2 about Jar-Jar Binks. That's the kind of thing we're left with in Cars 2. Compounding the story problems is the troubling amount of guns and violence in the film. To make the argument that 'it's OK because they're just cars' is inexcusable. This is still supposed to be a children's film, and while the espionage sub-plot does have potential, there are elements that seem shockingly unsuitable for young kids.This brings up a question: why would Pixar choose to revisit the only film they have produced which could conceivably be called a failure? Lasseter is on record as saying that the company would only explore sequels to their films if a good story could be developed, and the level of quality of the two Toy Story sequels seems to back up this sentiment, but it's hard to believe that anyone would think the script of Cars 2 is worthy of that high standard. Interestingly, there is one other way that Cars stands apart from other Pixar films: the estimated $8 billion merchandising revenues. While all Pixar films have profited from merchandising, none have had the global appeal of Cars. It's upsetting to think that Pixar, a company who seemed previously to place greater importance on the quality of its films than the bottom line, have gone for the easy cash grab, but there really seems to be no other reason for the existence of Cars 2. Everything about the films seems designed to increase the potential for selling merchandise, whether it's the films global locations which pander to international audiences, or the increasingly ridiculous characters and set-pieces, tailor made to be toys and video games. It's a cynical opinion, one which I had hoped I'd never feel towards a Pixar film, but it is undeniably true: Cars 2 is a film created not as an artistic endeavour, but to feed ancillary markets.Pixar's golden run had to end sometime, and one bad film is a small price to pay for 11 good, with two or three being genuine masterpieces. What is most unfortunate is the catastrophic level of Cars 2's failure, and Pixar will undoubtedly lose a lot of respect for making such a soulless film, unworthy of the studio's name."
1205,tt1216475,5,"We hoped it would never happen, but no one is perfect. Even the best can stumble. This had to happen eventually. Even the string of terrific Disney's classic films and the 90s Disney Renaissance didn't last forever. I'm afraid that, yes, Pixar has made a bad film.Cars 1 was their least ambitious film. The story was predictable and character development obvious making it their most mediocre film. It was good but it lacked that little extra touch that made their films great. However, they had some great side characters, a heart, and wonderful scenes that elevated it up beyond most other films. But ever since this film's announcement I always wondered why. McQueen had his story and there's not much else to tell. Like Finding Nemo, where else is there to go? And I'd rather see sequels to better movies like The Incredibles, even Bug's Life seems to have more potential. It's easy to see why they made a sequel to it, since all you need to do is go to Disneyland or any Disney Store and see it covered in McQueen and Mater, which happened to be two my of three year-old cousin's first words. Off all the Pixar films, Cars made the most with the merchandise.The biggest problem is the story. Cars 1, while predictable, was touching. Cars 2 has almost no heart or character development. The focus shifts from McQueen to Mater. McQueen had his story in the first and there's little to tell here. He has one character moment that's essentially the same realization as the first film's. The problem with Mater is that he's such a simple character. Everything about him is on the surface for all to see. He's the same person throughout the movie, with one predictable realization which goes no where, that he doesn't warrant his own film. He's like Kronk from The Emperor's New Groove. They're both terrific side characters but lack enough complexity for a full story. And Larry the Cable Guy has always been better with the other Blue Collar guys rather than on his own.While Cars 1's highlight was its side characters, this movie almost abandons them. They do nothing. McMissile is a moving plot device and little more. Shiftwell is supposed to be a love interest but lacks any interesting moments. The rest of Radiator Springs basically sit back while McQueen and Mater have all the fun. Their stories and character are pushed aside so Larry can have fun being Mater. Because of this, there are almost no funny little side scenes where characters just have fun being themselves. Instead, most of the humor is derived from seeing Mater do silly things.The look is impressive but not more than anything else Pixar's done. With each movie, the studio has pushed the graphics into new levels. Each movie has had some wow moment where audiences can't help but be amazed by what they're seeing. There were times in Cars 1 when it looked almost real. Cars 2 lacks any wow factor. One of the most impressive sets, Tokyo, were already spoiled by the Tokyo Mater short. This more than anything makes me wonder if Pixar was even trying to up the ante or if they were just using what they had to make a movie a year.Spies and Cars seems to work well together. After all, any Bond or Bourne film will easily demonstrate why the two go together. Indeed, the opening scene on the drilling platform is easily the best with the fast chase and cool gadgets. But they weren't able to properly combine the racing and spy elements, almost as if you're watching two movies at once. There's too much spy stuff for the racing to be interesting, which becomes pointless against the overpowering and overly clichéd spy story. Perhaps Pixar should have set it as simply a spy movie set in the Cars universe and had McQueen and his friends in cameos or as a background story.Another lousy spot is the music. Cars 1 had a terrific soundtrack with excellent uses of popular songs like Life is a Highway and Route 66. But there's not one memorable song or music cue in this movie. Giacchino usually does terrific work like with The Incredibles, Ratatouille, and Up. But he too fumbles the ball here. Perhaps he was just uninspired by what he had to work with.Cars is Lasseter's pet project. But I think he's too close to it. He's got that Lucas Star Wars prequel trilogy problem. The people around him either were in awe of the man who made Pixar and Toy Story or they were afraid to hurt his feelings since he loves the Cars franchise so much. Pixar efforts have been so well done because they were collaborative efforts, each fixing each other's problems to make a better project. But with Lasseter off working more directly with Disney, he really should have had a co-director or perhaps given the reins to someone else like he did with Toy Story 3.I almost rated this movie higher. It is fun while you're watching it, even if as soon as it's over it becomes too easy to pick apart the problems. But this is Pixar. They've dominated the animation market since Toy Story and have been pushing the boundaries at the Academy Awards ever since. To see them stumble with a not-so-great film would be one thing. But they're coming off from two Best Picture nominees to a movie that's simply flashy but with little substance. Kids will love the bright colors and silly antics, but parents will hate having to then buy twelve new Mater toys. Cars 2 is stalled and in need of a tune-up."
1206,tt1216475,6,"Espionage, assassinations, sabotage of renewable energy, propaganda, corporate cover-ups, media manipulation and The Mob...James Bond? Nope. Jason Bourne? Nope. Disney/Pixar's CARS 2. Wow. This movie wasn't at all what I was expecting. In the second serving of Lightning McQueen and his pals, they take their show to the international stage in a world championship race-off sponsored by oil-alternative manufacturer, Allinol. But turmoil behind the scenes pulls the gang into a world of spies, the Mob, Big Oil, evil German scientists and hit men. Now they have to save the world before it's too late. Oh, and they race too. The animation is amazing. Water, large balloons, backgrounds during races...pay attention because the quality of the graphics in this one are world-class. There are some goofy, funny moments and some nice one- liners for the older crowd. The themes of being true to yourself and bonds of friendship run strong throughout this film but it's the remainder of the message that worried me. There were non-stop put downs throughout and some other questionable topics. I was beginning to question the G rating when the villain ordered his henchmen to ""kill"" several other cars. Thinking back to the innocence and the good spirit of the first movie, I began to wonder how we got from there to here. Adventures in racing take a back-seat to the more mature plot of an espionage thriller. Looking around the theater, I could tell that kids younger than 4 or 5 were beginning to get lost. Even my ten-year-old had a hard time understanding the socio-political messages. On top of all that, I'd be willing to bet that Cars 2 is a contender for most guns, explosions and bullets fired in a G-Rated movie. This movie had much more violence than the first one.Aside from the appropriateness of the movie, it wasn't bad. All the likable characters from the first movie were back with bigger roles like 'Mater & Luigi and there were many new characters added that also brought their own personalities into the mix. To me, this was an espionage-thriller so the added bonus of some comedy made the movie move right along at a good pace. It was engaging for me, I enjoyed it, but the entire time I couldn't help but wonder why Disney/Pixar chose to tell this story through a kids movie."
1207,tt1216475,7,"It is true that this film is not like others Pixar films.But it is not acctualy so bad.Many review-writers is telling that this film is huge disappointment,and I think it is not true.I think that expectations was too big.So,this is story about cars.About one friendship.They are completely different,but they are best friends.There is lot of nice,simple humor in the story.The scenario is ""smooth"" and it is easy watchable.There are much of action,surprises,cool techniques,like in James Bond. Yes,we could not expect that,but it is really OK .The characters are in many different places and they are meeting a different people.Characters are 3D,they have feelings and we feel empathy about them.But,there is a ""dark side"" of film,which is not like Pixar.Enemies,propaganda and that stuff.These problems confuses and my 10 year old brother.It is not ugly or violent,it is just confusing to kids.About animation,I will not discuss.It is still Pixar;great animations and visuals and everything about it.This is family film and it is really relaxing and enjoyable.Maybe sometimes is confusing,but it is not acctualy so bad.Because of action and messages that film gives: 7/10"
1208,tt1216475,7,"Cars 2 wasn't the worst thing I'd ever seen, but on the other hand, it was nowhere NEAR as good as the original.It was a cute movie with some pretty funny scenes, but it didn't have a memorable story, or anything really to let you love it.I barely even watch it, in fact. If I am bored, it's a cute movie to watch, but it's not very intriguing.It's more of a comedy, honestly.The first one to me, meant finding yourself, who you truly are, and taking time to settle down. It was memorable, it was beautiful, and it had funny jokes.This one is just a silly movie hiring a country boy as a spy to defeat a guy who is called a lemon.Not much to this one as the first one, but honestly, if you want a action spy movie with a not-very exciting plot, you can watch this."
1209,tt1216475,8,"Sometimes you go to a Pixar movie and get a deeply insightful, heart-tugging classic that sings to the deepest corners of the human condition.And sometimes you go to a Pixar movie for some uncomplicated fun and adventure.""Cars 2"" is unapologetically the latter; it never reaches the emotional depths of ""Up"" or ""Toy Story 3"", but it never tries to be. Instead, this is a family-friendly action-packed adventure movie, the kind of movie you watch because you just want to sit back and enjoy the spectacle. Whether it's the gorgeous scenery, the breakneck chase sequences, or Finn McMissile's never-ending arsenal of cool gadgets, ""Cars 2"" is a movie that simply wants you to have fun as you follow along with its whirlwind escapades.Some might feel this is a disappointment from Pixar, but I think that's being unfair -- after all, no one begrudges Steven Spielberg for producing both ""Schinder's List"" and ""Indiana Jones"".""Cars 2"" isn't high art, but it never tries to be. Even the best creators deserve to cut back and have fun once in a while."
1210,tt1216475,6,"Cars 2 is the Pixar movie you think you hate but it is actually kind of okay. I wasn't ""very disappointed"" as a lot of other people were, but I wasn't amazed. The animation is great but the story was poor. It had all of this spy nonsense and Mater was the protagonist. That's what I didn't like about the movie. The Tokyo race was a lot of fun despite those ""crashes"" from the cars. I'll say that it was an ""average"" movie."
1211,tt1204342,7,"I must admit, I usually write reviews when i am angry, however in this case, I am writing this review because of pure love for the movie.I went to this movie expecting few laughs and an enjoyable night. My expectations were met and more. the songs were great, the plot was classic Hollywood plot but they made fun of it so it didn't bother me at all. I laughed at all the jokes without exception. I didn't know the whole cast so the surprise appearances affected me emotionally. most importantly, I felt that the people who are doing that movie didn't acted on that movie for the money, for the box office or for the fame, they did it for pure love for the Muppet's(most of them anyways) and I felt that. I was asking my self why I loved this movie? and this is was the answer I got. As long as these kinds of movies being made, there is still hope for Hollywood."
1212,tt1204342,1,"The Muppets is essentially flawless. I know this is a weird way to start a review, but I feel I should just forego formalities and cut to the chase. This year has been a fairly disappointing year for movies, but The Muppets just about makes up for it all by itself. It's an absolutely life-affirming tribute to beloved characters and memories that should have never been allowed to fade into obscurity, and if you care at all about movies you need to see this, as soon as possible. Jason Segel, along with co-writer Nicholas Stoller and director James Bobin have made a film that is just absolutely bursting at the seams with affection towards the Muppets, and that love and passion has instantly rocketed this movie to the very top of the list when it comes to long history of Muppet shows, movies, and even viral videos. The film is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time and accomplishes this without being crass or cynical; it's smart, witty, and most importantly, completely heartfelt. Jason Segel with his obvious and undying love for the Muppets is, by all accounts, the most deserving person to be given creative control of the Muppets since Jim Henson himself. The original Muppet Movie will always be a timeless classic, and it's charm and legacy will likely never be topped by another Muppet movie. However, The Muppets is the closest it has ever come, and, due to the timeliness and poignancy of the story, I would argue that right at this moment it is more relevant and moving than even the 1979 classic. I was unable to stop smiling during the entire running time of the movie, even while tears were coming to my eyes. I know I'm not really reviewing the movie right now, and I'm more just beaming about how much I loved it, but really, I feel it would be a disservice to go into details about this movie. Simply put, you need to see it, and if you don't you're robbing yourself of a truly extraordinary film experience. This is the most sensational, inspirational, celebrational, Muppetational movie of the year. Go see it. Right now. I mean it, go buy tickets for this weekend, and you can thank me later. A+"
1213,tt0401729,1,"John Carter is an unjustly dismissed sci-fi masterpiece...grossly unjustified. What was wrong with it? Specifically, what was wrong? Pacing? It was intense!!! Coming from someone who uses this word sparingly, this movie was ""EPIC"". I am almost certain that time will enable objectivity, and objectivity will redeem it from the stinging taint slapped on it due to a predictably simplistic aversion to what is ""mainstream"" by film critics. If a studio other than Disney could have created the same film with half the budget it would have been heralded as a cinematic achievement within the sci-fi genre, but its budget was viewed as ostentatious and its production studio as childish, so it became ""cool"" to hate on it before anyone had even seen it.Who makes something and how much they pay to have it made has nothing to due with the quality of what is actually produced, it may be indicative of quality or lack thereof, but the final product speaks for itself. Reviews of John Carter tell us more about film critics than the critics told us about the film. It was practically perfect. ""Incomprehensible plotting""??? They laid the groundwork for the presumed sequels by deliberately leaving a few questions unanswered, which I hope they still make and answer because I loved this first one! Mars was epic, and then in the end we are reminded that the story began on Earth and the film ends stronger than I could have hoped for! An excellent story masterfully told on screen."

This movie should of been more successful and despite what most of the critics and viewers are saying about this movie, ""that its a lot like Star Wars and Avatar"", that is not true. I have found John Carter to be an amazing movie visually, and the story was actually great. Don't get me wrong, Star Wars and Avatar were great movies, but I believe that John Carter was far much different and slightly better. I saw John Carter in the theaters the week that it came out and I had a lot of fun watching this movie!. So the hell with the critics, in my opinion, John Carter kicked ass!!!!."

Just a super fun movie.I'm not going to spoil it for you, the less you know the better. I will tell you that John Carter was written by Edgar Rice Burroughs, the man who wrote Tarzan. But unlike Tarzan this is science fiction. If you liked Star Wars, if you liked Willow, if you like adventure and action movies then check this one out. I might even buy it, which I almost never do any more. This was SUCH a pleasant surprise.I just wish I had a 3D TV, because it comes in 3D also."

This is not a wham bam in your face Avengers movie, but a grand epic with a tribute to one of the greatest American writers of his time: Edgar Rice Burroughs.Thank you Disney for your bold efforts. Sales might be the standard of today, but in the hearts of John Carter fans this was a great movie. Put to the screen with taste, class, and detail that will let this story live on. May your efforts be rewarded with continued sales as this movie finds its way toward cult status."
1217,tt0401729,9,"This is not going to be a long review, there are some great reviews on here and I think they have said all I wanted and more. The thing to hold onto is that despite all the negative hype in the worldwide press, this is one heck of a great movie. I have no idea why any film studio would want to distance themselves from this film, it is fresh in a time when fresh is a very rare thing in the movies. Avatar managed it in heaps and so does John Carter. The story is grand and intriguing, the characters are solid and believable, and the CGI is so good you forget about it. This will become one of my favourite all time movies, it is up there amongst the very best of the genre. Don't believe the hype.. this is a must see movie!!"
1218,tt0401729,1,"I have so much to say about this movie but I guess I should start with what or who is John Carter.John Carter (Kitsch) is an American Civil War soldier who is transported to Mars. He first encounters the green skinned warlike nomads known as the Tharks and, due to his superhuman powers (Mars gravity and all that), quickly becomes embroiled in not only the political issues of the Tharks, but those of the red skinned, humanoid Martians as well. The humanoids control Mars through a series of city states with Zodanga annihilating everything in it's path. Helium is the last free state. Helium also has a beautiful and feisty Princess (Collins) and a political marriage to save all has been arranged. Then she meets our handsome hero.yep you guessed it. The two fall in love and are now fighting for not just what they love and believe in but who they love and believe in.This movie is based on the book Princess of Mars, the first in a series of 11 novels written by Edgar Rice Burroughs 100 years ago. They are also known as The Barsoom or John Carter of Mars series. A lot of what you have seen in these types of movies up until now has drawn, in some way, on this series of novels. Star Wars, Avatar, Babylon 5, Flash Gordon and even some Indiana Jones. I am sure the list is endless but Sci Fi is not my genre. When you watch John Carter, you will be able to pick the similarities immediately.If you are aware of this movie's existence, then you are probably aware of the negative attention it has garnered. I saw this movie over 2 weeks ago and have had to watch as people all over the internet trash it. They have laughed at Disney for spending $250 million on an obvious dud. They have said Disney has distanced itself from the movie before it's release. They have criticised everything from the trailers to the posters to the casting of 2 unknowns as the leads. Oh and they have done all this without having seen the movie! These people are best ignored and sent back to their mother's basements!! Now, I will say that Disney has done itself NO favours whatsoever with the posters and trailers for John Carter. This I will concede. But I have found the best trailer on You Tube and it was made by serious fans of the books thejohncarterfiles.Please, if you are going to watch a trailer for this movie, make it this one. It just gives you a much better idea of what the movie looks like.So what did I think? I LOVED it. I really, truly did. I wanted to see it because I had read so much about it over the last few years. Sci Fi may not be my thing but that doesn't mean I don't know what's going on in the land of movie making.This movie has all the blockbuster action we have come to expect from this genre. The CGI is spectacular. The Martian characters are fantastic. The stand out Martian is without a doubt Woola, a pet that adopts John Carter and is as ugly as he is adorable. An ugly slug like animal that will melt your heart. Trust me :) There is good vs evil. There is Martian vs Martain. There is human vs human. There is serious stuff. There is fun stuff. A stand out scene I just cannot resist mentioning.When Carter does arrive on Mars, his introduction to Tars Tarkas is absolutely hilarious. The mistake with his name becomes an ongoing gag throughout the movie and to great affect. Even our hero gives up, smiles and just shakes his head. Oh and yes, there is a very easy and believable reason why they all speak English.This movie is for everyone who likes Star Wars or Avatar. It's for everyone who ever wished they could go to Mars. It's for everyone who likes a love story between a handsome hero and beautiful, spirited Princess. It's for everyone who wants to see a great movie and escape, literally, to another world for 2 hours. It's for everyone who likes a simple Sci Fi story. It's for everyone who likes a layered story they can think on a little later. It's for little kids (although at over 2 hours running length it may just be a tad too long for our littlest movie goers) and it's for big kids.Ignore the critics and go see this movie. I think you will enjoy it. I saw it in 3D and I usually think 3D is a waste of money (sorry studios) but for this movie, fork out the extra $5 and see it in 3D.Mars never looked so good."
1219,tt0401729,8,"I did only have modest expectations of this film as the trailer reminded me a bit to much of Dune. Really surprised to find a film which had a good plot line (albeit cynics will liken it to Avatar-lite), well acted, reasonable characterisations, brilliant visuals and a surprisingly good hero figure in Taylor Kitsch. I saw the preview screening this morning - don't really care how much it cost to make - what I found was a big budget film that I really enjoyed from start to finish. My advice - don't follow the cynics and naysayers - see it for yourself. I will normally not go see 3D films (they give me a headache) but the 3D wasn't too intrusive on this one."
1220,tt0401729,1,"In today's culture there's no place for fairy-tales. There's no place for simple but highly imaginative stories with a clear moral message. There's no respect for visionaries, no credit given to those who created fully-blown worlds out of nothing. Everything has to be 'dark', 'gritty', 'real' and morally ambiguous, even dubious. Or simply loud and dumb. There's no place for movies that embody the very thing cinema was invented for: the magical power of limitless imagination.From George Lucas's wonderful creations to Avatar, from very original tales like The Golden Compass or Stardust to John Carter, movies that do not fit in today's bitter world are bashed endlessly, or outright bomb at the box office, as John Carter did. However, if you, like me, refuse to bow to this lack of imagination, and liked the aforementioned movies, then you'll probably fall in love with John Carter, too. It is truly amazing. As my friend put it, 'It's the best Star Wars since Avatar'.(Note: I admit, I haven't read Edgar Rice Borroughs' Mars-series, but as far as I know, fans of the novels were pleased with the movie adaptation, as well.)"
1221,tt0401729,1,"It's a great movie. I'm not sure why it didn't make more money or get a sequel. It has a great storyline, good acting, beautiful visuals. It was well written and just altogether a great movie. You won't be disappointed."
1229,tt1222815,9,"This is the story of the baby chimp Oscar, and his clan of 35 monkeys , as they struggle to survive in the jungle forest. It contains truly incredible nature photography of the clan as they interact with each other, search for food, use tools when needed, and protect themselves from neighboring monkey troops.At first, I thought the story was fabricated and edited to where Disney wanted to go with the film. But when you see the filmmakers and what they went through to get the amazing close-up shots that they did I realized that was not the case. I believe this was the same crew that filmed ""African Cats"" which was another spectacular documentary.Without disclosing too much of the plot, let's just say a dramatic event happens to Oscar during the film, and what happens thereafter is stunning and I'm sure extremely unusual.Tim Allen narrated the film in a very lighthearted way. From what I've read this hampered the film for some, but for whatever reason it didn't bother me."
1222,tt0401729,1,"The most overwhelming feeling that prevailed with me after I saw this movie tonight, was incredulity! I couldn't -and still can't- understand why this movie has gotten such bad reviews?!? It most certainly isn't justified! I, for one, LOVED it! As did my good friend and movie connoisseur Jacarrino. I am going to BUY this movie when it comes out on Blu-ray 3D! I may even go and buy a Blu-ray DVD player and a stupendously large Flatscreen 3D TV so I can watch it over and over again! It is THAT good!To be clear: I am an ERB-fan (Edgar Rice Burroughs, the genius that over a hundred (yes) years ago wrote the original books about John Carter, Jeddak of Helium, Warlord of Mars and the incomparable Dejah Thoris!) I read the first of the John Carter novels out of curiosity a couple of years ago and was instantly hooked! ERB is one of the all time greatest Sci Fi writers to ever grace us with his remarkable story-telling talent and no mistake!This movie, and I would like this opportunity the express my warm and heartfelt gratitude to Disney for making this project a reality, has everything one could possibly want in an entertaining, believable, captivating movie. My only regret about seeing this movie, is that I didn't get a chance to see it on Imax 3D... I was too late for that! If YOU still have a chance to see it in an Imax 3D theater somewhere: GO! you will NOT regret it!Like I said, I'm sure ERB would be most proud of this wonderful and thoroughly enjoyable rendering of his story on the silver screen!"
1223,tt1222815,1,"I really liked Chimpanzee. Not a movie, but a true story, and a damned good one. If you're an animal lover or a nature enthusiast, if you enjoy perfect cinematography, if you've got a heart at all, you will probably enjoy it."
1224,tt1222815,6,"From the people that brought you the fantastic documentary—Earth—comes a documentary cut from an entirely different cloth. Unlike Earth, Chimpanzee is able to weave a storyline by following a specific clan of chimps, giving each one a name, and following a youngster as he learns the rough life of the forest. The personal touch is brilliant and allows for a heartfelt documentary. In the end, the only problems are in the way the movie is edited and narrated.One of the best things about Chimpanzee is the way in which it elicits empathy from the viewer. The movie focuses on features of chimpanzees that remind of us ourselves—using tools to get food, breastfeeding, and youth playing games while adults try to sleep. By the time the documentary develops a plot, you will honestly care about the characters involved. You will laugh time and time again.You will not cry. Despite the disturbing and depressing nature of the film, everything is glazed over. This points us directly at the core problem of Chimpanzee—the narration. First off, Tim Allen wasn't the right choice. He doesn't do the inflections correctly and often speaks far too excitedly. The other major problem with the narration is the script. When Tim Allen started speaking for the Chimps, I was amused. When it continued, it became rather annoying. The narration should have been used to support the documentary—not overshadow it.Chimpanzee was marketed as a children's film. We received the children's preshow and nothing but adolescent trailers. That is what stopped the documentary from being great. By skipping over the scenes that are too hard to watch and not diving into the real reason an Alpha Male would take in a young chimp, the documentary shortchanges itself. Earth was great because it wasn't directed at an adolescent audience. That freed the team up to build the best movie. The same was not the case for Chimpanzee.If you enjoy documentaries, you will enjoy Chimpanzee. Although the movie does not deliver critical thoughts, it is filled with incredible visuals and an intriguing storyline. If you are not a fan of documentaries, there is no reason to see Chimpanzee. I hope this movie does not show a trend for wide release documentaries. Documentaries are beautiful when they are not dumbed down for our children.reillyreviews.wordpress.com"
1225,tt1222815,1,"I work as a wildlife cameraman - but (sadly) was not involved in this film. When I watched it I realised a new bench mark has been set for these wildlife feature movies. Anyone who has worked in West Africa will agree it is one of the toughest habitats to film in - and chimps can be one of the hardest animals to follow. With that in mind, the achievement of getting a unique true story like this - one that brings us so close to the animals in every way - is quite remarkable. I don't want to put in spoilers, but the story is heartwarming and the characters so strong that you could almost believe this was animated - but it is much better than that. This is true life. A beautiful movie!"
1226,tt1222815,9,"The most striking feature I noticed while watching this film was the resemblance of these creatures to my neighbors. It's incredible how similar to us they are!Granted, Doña Carmen and Don José don't go as far as to deflea each other while carrying on a casual conversation on a sidewalk, but the similarities in body gestures and specially when persistently looking at the camera lens (it happened several times, whether intentionally or not) and we could see overwhelmingly human eyes looking at us, can be quite disturbing.Impeccable photography with so many close ups that one wonders constantly at how they had managed to take those shots without disturbing the animals. I'm sure Disney has the most sophisticated equipment in the World in order to present such splendipherous depth of lenses and superb sharpness all the time, even from long distances, but even so, chimpanzees have a very sensitive sense of smell and I'm sure they could detect human presence from afar, but apparently it left them unconcerned and they proceeded naturally with their daily chores.The forest, breathtaking, specially from the air, and the lushness of all that green carpet we see below seems to go forever on behind those far away mountains; when the camera goes down to ground level it's disconcerting to notice how very little sunlight reaches these animals.Since it was a Disney film, obviously thought out for children, the notorious lack of restrain among monkeys and chimps when it comes to bodily functions, including everything related to sex, which is so habitual to see in zoos in broad daylight, here there is no trace whatsoever of it, like in those old Doris Day films, where everything was squeaky clean. A good film for Eco-friendly fans. P.S.: I gave it a 9 because of the titanic efforts of the whole crew and the tenacity they put into the project, working under such harsh and probably dangerous conditions."
1227,tt1222815,9,"After taking my husband to see Chimpanzee last night (as I have no school age kids to drag) I have to give it two bananas up! We both loved it. What a refreshing change to see a film that almost any age could see together and have a great discussion afterward.Gorgeously filmed and just the right length to keep smaller ones from getting bored, I was amazed at the footage that the filmmakers got of these chimps. I am one of those who has trouble leaving the primate area of the zoo and it does make you marvel at their similarities with humans.You'll feel like you just went on a trip to the rain forest of Africa, and I can't imagine a child or teen not liking this. Or an adult for that matter."
1228,tt1222815,7,"What can really be said about this movie.... Its a fantastic documentary, and unlike other wildlife documentary's its not overly sad or graphic, so parents can bring their kids. The shots and views of the chimps and the rain forest, are absolutely amazing. All aspects of the lives of chimpanzees are shown, even the not so glamorous ones. However the filmmakers show the harshness of the lives of chimps while appealing to all ages, and not sacrificing content. For example: in one of the few scenes at can be perceived as violent, an obscured view of the chimps is shown, not enough to mask their actions, but enough to make it tasteful. Tim Allen does a fantastic job of narrating, being both funny and informative. He even makes a throw back joke or two. This film is inspiring, fun, and informative. Its fun for the whole family, and I am not just saying that. I left the theater thinking how alike humans and chimpanzees are, and would recommend this movie to any animal lover."
1230,tt1222815,7,"I walked into this movie not knowing what to expect. I am more of a ""serious"" moviegoer, and I generally don't see films geared towards children. I would describe this movie as half brilliant documentary and half cheesy kids movie.I had issues with the color timing in parts, which made the film look almost animated and artificial. I wasn't quite sure what to believe was natural footage and what was some sort of staged animal wrangling or CGI. As the movie progressed it became pretty clear that it was all authentic, but Tim Allen's narration combined with the almost-too-convenient dramatic story arc still kept me at arm's length.Ultimately this movie delivers a touching story of a young primate and his tribe. Though somewhat contrived at times there are many, many moments of genuine intimacy that tug the heartstrings and also make you wonder how in the world they got these shots. Thankfully there's a bit of explanation at the end.Do I regret seeing it? Not at all. Do I wish it had been made as a more traditional documentary? Yes."
1231,tt1222815,1,"There still are people on this earth who care enough to work hard, live in unforgiving climates to tell an amazing story of survival, friendship and love. The story, photography, location, narrating and the chimps were the real star's, especially our little hero Oscar. We attended the a.m. showing of ""chimpanzee"" in Kanata AMC. I will promote this movie with the hope parents will take their children to understand the beauty,friendship and caring of the chimpanzee world. We would have liked additional footage shown at the end of the movie on how the set-up and filming took place. I can only imagine how horrible it was when Oscar's mom Izza was attacked and succumbed to death from a leopard. Would love to have been there to see Freddy accept little Oscar.Thank you for all the hard work and beautiful story. I will be attending again before April 26th to help the Jane Goodall Foundation. Cheers, Cher"
1232,tt1222815,7,"Today I saw the latest DisneyNature release, Chimpanzee. While I thought it would be a lot like every other G rated Disney nature film, I admit it - I liked it. Although, I wondered through the whole showing if this was a scripted movie. Stuff like this doesn't really happen in true-life nature, does it?? So I came home and Googled it. This IS a Disney/Jane Goodall Institute Documentary about the life of Oscar, a very young chimp in the African jungle. It took 4 years to film. And the incredible turns of events are all true. The film makers lucked out in coming across a story that is fairly rare. My biggest caution is that Disney put together this movie in such a way as to get you very attached to the chimps they filmed. In this way, Disney leaves behind the detachment that should be present whenever a documentary is produced.This movie was made with children in mind, however they didn't gloss over too much real life in the jungle sort of thing. They show chimps hunting (for monkey meat) and they show different chimpanzee ""tribes"" at war. There are also some mothers nursing. And in true Disney fashion, a parent dies. The thing that stings a bit is that it really happened, so, as always, take into consideration your child's personality if you take them to see it. Disney did a good job of letting us adults know what was happening without being too graphic. While there is hunting for meat, there is no blatant devouring or ripping and tearing of flesh. And when the parent dies they talk about it, but she isn't seen shortly after she is separated from her group. And in the end, it isn't totally a story about warring chimp tribes but rather a story about one chimpanzee going against his nature to care for a helpless, orphaned youngster. There were several pre-schoolers in the audience when I saw it and none of them had a problem that I was aware of.Tim Allen narrates this movie with the style and voice of a typical Disney movie. In fact, at the beginning I was wondering where they got that guy from the nature films I saw in 1970! The film makers got extremely lucky to have the honor of catching on film a rare story that gives us a glimpse into a world normally hidden by jungle trees. The photography is amazing (how did they possibly get that close to wild beings to get the shots they did??). I was glad, too, that Disney has made a nature movie with children in mind. I loved Disney Nature movies when I was a child and I am glad that my grandchildren can see them too."
1233,tt2404027,9,"1. As an animation film....fabulous. Haven't seen anything of this level earlier from India . will truly put it on the international animation level . Reminded me of some of the classic animation films from the west. even though it was not like those giant expensive 3d films, in fact that is what made it refreshing. just the classic style and beautiful details. 2. As a story, loved it. while it spoke of something we are all so familiar with in India, it still managed to keep us glued and wait for whats next. Hats off for taking a known story and yet making it so interesting. Waiting for a sequel 3. After ages, some sensible , clean cinema...with no sleazy dances and loud abusive language. I didn't have to cringe while watching it with the family 4. Was so good to see that people are still trying to make clean beautiful looking films 5. And most importantly all age groups seem to have enjoyed it thoroughly!"
1234,tt2404027,1,"I loved the movie!! No doubt it deviates quite a lot from the epic, but I being in the animation industry, can clearly understand the animations are not ordinary, as pointed out by many. People who have absolutely no knowledge about animation, can please stay away from writing negative feedback for the movie.It was 3D in 2D animation, where the movie is released in 2D, but the background and contrast characters have a 3D feeling!! People who haven't noticed this will have a good time noticing it.If there's a sequel then I will surely look forward to this movie. But yeah, people who do not like darker themes in the movie, wherein the hero suffers but then rises, may stay away!! Because this is not exactly pertaining to the epic, but it's surely shown in a good way.!!"
1235,tt2404027,1,"One word Excellent.......I have watched many Indian animations but after Ramayan the legend of price Ram, Arjun is the only animated movie I really loved.The Animation is just out of this world and it can compete with any other animation movies of the world.Not only animation but the story telling was also very cool, I think it the best way to tell this story and its not lengthy at all, movie is just 2 hrs long I think, which is cool, I think children as well as Adults will enjoy it,and best part is everyone will take away something from it.Keep up the good work."
1236,tt2404027,8,"Excellent movie who want to see ""Arjun"" in 2 hours.I have seen other animation movies made on Indian epics. But this seems to be the best of all. Excellent Animation, Direction, Story, Sound track, everything. The songs and dialogs of the movie are excellent. The climax I thought could have been better as they build up nicely but did not led to expectations. This movie definitely seems to take the Indian animation movie to the next level and I have also known the way they made this movie that is the main reason I liked it and I gave 8/10.However, the movie sure differentiate a lot from the actual epic and must not be watched for knowledge purpose or to know Mahabharata. There are many mistakes in the movie and story line as well, which, If I start explaining, may take a lot of my time.Those who want to watch this, for entertainment purpose, for making their children aware about some hero in Indian history, for those who like animation and sound effects, for those who live abroad and want to see or show a glance of Indian ancient story to their family members, and for few others this is an excellent attempt by Arnab Chaudhuri.Those who knows Mahabharata, those who want to know Mahabharata, those who like more realistic and factual storyline, you all must no rely on this movie as this is purely a animation movie.Overall a pretty good attempt."
1237,tt2404027,1,"There were a couple of reasons that prompted me to venture for Arjun-The Warrior Prince. First significant reason was the trailer of the film, unveiled 4 years back, and which was spectacular. It was a time when there was an overdose of shoddy animated films, all based on mythical tales. But Arjun-The Warrior Prince stood out, because of its treatment, as evident from the promo. Secondly, my knowledge about Mahabharata has been extremely limited (never read the texts and was not born when B R Chopra's version was aired on TV). Just like I got my needed gyaan of Ramayana from the successful animated Ramayana – The Legend Of Prince Rama, I expected Arjun-The Warrior Prince to do the needful! Almost 100 minutes long, Arjun-The Warrior Prince has its flaws but at the same time has some dramatic moments that make for a great viewing! The story of the movie: The Pandavas have a bad time as they are compelled to co-exist with their cousins, the Kauravas in Hastinapur. Arjun, from the Pandavas, turns out to be a good archer but despises violence and is unsure if he's capable of being a leader. However, circumstances, perseverance, efficient training and words of his guru Dronacharya all lead to Arjun discovering the warrior in himself as he takes on an entire army single-handedly.Arjun-The Warrior Prince doesn't throw light on the great war of Kurukshetra. Nor does it show the humiliating vastraharana of Draupadi. The film, as the title suggests, is about Arjun and how he establishes himself as a firm warrior. The beginning portions were disinteresting but film gets damn interesting once the characters are firmly established. The swayamvar sequence, which was shown in the trailer as well, was one of the finest scenes in the film. The animation is 2D, unlike the 3D animation that is in vogue nowadays. Yet, it works well and after Hanuman, this is easily the second best mythological film of Bollywood! Director Arnab Chaudhuri has incorporated various panning and zoom-in shots that were like an icing on the cake in the film. Several scenes of the river and snow-capped peaks seemed straight out of life! The songs and background score too created the right impact. Besides, there's a parallel story going on as well which boasts of an excellent twist towards the finale. The climax was slightly rushed but nevertheless works well! Talking of flaws, the film has an erratic pacing at several places. The scenes of Lord Krishna could have been better. Although it's an animated film, there's not much humour in the film. In fact, the whole film has an undercurrent of tension going on. Also, the shuddh Hindi might be difficult to comprehend for kids who are the target audience of the film.The voice-over artists do a great job with the characters not sounding too childish or mature. The animation guys sketched the characters aptly, especially in case of Pandavas and Duryodhan – each one of them looked distinct. Shakuni Mama and his pony were easily the best ones! The music of the film is given by Vishal-Shekhar and has some very peppy foot-tapping numbers (Daanav and Karm Ki Talwar were the best). Even the background score was terrific and escalated the impact in many scenes. Arnab Chaudhuri's direction had its flaws but was neat overall. Mahabharata is long and complex and to narrate a significant portion from the epic in 100 minutes is a feat after all! On the whole, Arjun-The Warrior Prince is a rare animated mythological film from Bollywood that is well-made and boasts of an animation that's surely worth appreciating! Take your kids and they'll surely enjoy the tale of this mighty prince! The film faced plenty of films before it could get a release. Also UTV team could have generated a little more excitement about the film (although thankfully the awareness for the film was there pre-release). Fortunately, the film has done well in the weekend and should be able to recover costs. First Chhota Bheem and now Arjun-The Warrior Prince, animated Bollywood films are finally finding success at the box office!"
1238,tt2404027,2,"The movie 'Arjun: The warrior prince' is confused, its neither for kids nor is it for adults. And for a movie based on the greatest warrior on earth, it fails to capture the richness of the character. For me, this movie didn't work mainly due to not-so-good animation, truncation of characters and deviations from the original Mahabharata. Let me point out the details...Characters: Mahabharata has always been about the characters and their intertwined relationships. But this movie fails miserably in this aspect. Agreed that the movie is based on Arjuna, but that doesn't mean that the other characters could be tweaked at will. Characterization of Arjuna himself is pathetic and deviates too much from the epic. In the original epic, Arjuna is a master archer, who picks the Bow-arrow as his favorite weapon, and surpasses all at a very tender age of 18. He is the one who masters shooting arrows in the dark, and obtains the best of weapons for his worth. In the movie though, he is not able to summon up courage to fight or wage war until eternity... Here, Arjuna appears too weak as a warrior and his skills are almost nonexistent.There is no respite for other characters as well. Krishna, Bhishma, and Karna combined get a screen time of may be 5 minutes or so. And Bhima, that strongest and smartest warrior is used as a comic relief! Susharman, who is supposed to be king of a state is shown to be a animal-like wanderer of forest, with a bunch of thugs for his company. Yet, the award for worst characterization would go to Shakuni, who rides a pony to lead a war!! (unintentional laughs at best!). And oh well, Ashwatthama is absent from the cast, I wonder how Drona will be killed if there is a sequel!Animation: Animation of the human movements was jittery for most part and the physical attributes of warriors are not proportionate. In the final battle scene, when Arjun fights with Duryodhan, the latter actually looks twice the size of the former; which gives it a 'cartoonish' feel. There are a few scenes which are done better, like the swayamvar scene.And finally... The deviations from the original epic. Uncountable, but here are a few. (1) The famous bow of Arjuna is not even named in the movie! In the epic, Arjuna and the Gandiva bow are synonymous in battlefield. (2) How Arjuna learns to shoot-down targets in the dark is absent. For a movie solely based on Arjuna, this should have been included. (3) The scene of Rangbhoomi is done ordinarily and fails to capture the enmity between Karna and Pandavas. Here again, Arjuna seems to be a timid boy, but in the epic, he was already the most skilled and courageous warrior by then. In the epic, Superiority of Arjuna is highlighted by victory over Drupad, (father of Draupadi), which is not mentioned even verbally. (4) In the epic, in the Varnavat episode, it is Bhima who saves Pandavas from the burning palace. In the movie though, the pandavas are saved accidentally. Whats the need to truncate the elder brother's feats?? (5) The scene where Arjuna says 'This is the first time I have seen a person killed' is ridiculous. At this point, in the epic, Arjuna himself has taken part and won many battles!! (6) The movie does not mention any mythical weaponry which enables Arjuna to fight with an entire army single-handed. In fact, the very purpose of Arjuna going to Mount Kailash is to obtain these divine weapons. (7) Arjuna's journey to north and marriages are not mentioned at all. (8) The swayamvar scene is highly truncated, with no mentions of Kauravas who attended the same, and also the battle that ensues between Arjuna and Karna at the end of swayamvar (in which Arjuna defeats Karna). (9) The battle of Virata, which is the climatic scene in the movie, is the most ridiculous of them all. In the epic, this the book in which the jaw-dropping duels between each of Kaurava commander with Arjuna takes place, and Arjuna defeats all of them one-by-one. The duels are fought with bow and arrow with special arrows attacking and counter-attacking each other... In the movie though, the duels are fought by mini swords :) and to top it, Drona gains upper hand over Arjuna for no reason what-so- ever. Someone uninitiated would find it hard to accept Arjuna as the greatest warrior at this point. The other duels are not shown and finally Arjuna defeats Duryodhana. This is again ridiculous. As, Arjuna is always considered way stronger than Duryodhana (in fighting other than with mace), so no point in this battle. His true battles are with Karna, Ashwatthama, Bhishma and Drona, for they are the only ones with some chance of success against him!I could go on and on but I need to stop and return to work now... My opinion- Stay away from this movie if you are interested in the epic; an in case you want another action with Kung-fu sequences, there are many better Hollywood alternatives!"
1240,tt2404027,1,"I am very pleased with the movie. I went to watch this movie with my friends and family, the audience ranged from 7 year old to 60 year old. I have been watching animation movies from long time and have a knowledge about a 3d and 2d movie. Arjun the warrior Prince is par Excellence and the work by Walt Disney is indeed applauded. The story is not about the war of Mahabharat as mistaken by masses. Its the story about a war hero Arjun and how he reached to the peak in making history. It's the story about the journey and falling and rising back of Arjun. The graphics of this movie has broken all the records of previous movies and has set a threshold for future movies. Animators in India make movies from flash, and believe they make excellent Animation cinema, watch Arjun and you will understand what animation is all about.It's really unfortunate to know that this excellent work was a failure at Box Office, mainly due to Universal Studio and Walt Disney have problem in the production house.Not many theatres in India had it's screening and not much publicity was made.For all those who have not seen this class Movie, will urge them to watch it and then make your opinion. Also remember this story has nothing to do with the Mahabharat war, but it is a prelude to the war.Cheers, Manan Shah"
1241,tt2404027,9,"I was moved to see is because I know a bit about the Mahabarata - we saw the Indian TV version many years ago (it ran weekly, for quite a few months).The first surprise was the intermission, after only an hour!I don't know how involved the Disney company was in it. The character animation reminds me a bit of Disney's ""Pocahontas"", but the overall animation is unsurpassed. In one or two places, actual scenery is combined with the animation - but it is so well done you have to look for it. I think someone would enjoy this movie even if he didn't know the Mahabarata - but it certainly helps. The story glosses over some important details: why is blind King Dhritarashtra's wife blindfolded? Who is this Krishna fellow? And why is Arjuna disguised as a woman?There are at least two scenes that I remember from from the epic that are in the movie: one when Arjuna is learning archery from Bhishma [?], and sees only the eye of the bird in the tree (now we know he's going to be a great archer); the other when Yudhishthira loses his shirt in a dice game, run by the treacherous Shakuni. There may be others.The movie is a slice of the Mahabarata: it's Arjuna's story, how he grows into a true prince despite the best (=worst) efforts of the Kuru.Even if the story on the screen is hard to follow, the animation is superb. I have not seen better, even from Miyazaki. This is one movie I could see again."
1242,tt2404027,1,"One of the best movies in animation which is so awfully directed. Nice character.Superb actions and locations.Wow, it feels so proud to watch a superb movie created by Indians. When I saw Walt Disney name, I got an idea that this movie will be one of the coolest.Like Walt Disney, Indian companies should strive hard. Explore the creativeness to create exceptional animated movies. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.Thank you."
1243,tt1217209,8,"A true best of both worlds for classic Disney and classic Pixar fans. It had already been many years since the acquisition, but for me this was the first time Disney's buyout felt like a positive direction for the animation pioneers. Filled with possibly Pixar's most attractive environments, character designs (Side note: Merida has my favorite character design of any animated human character. I mean seriously her hair alone is a thing of beauty.), and easily its best score, the studio does a deft send up of classic princess movies while instilling the pure feeling of magic they are known for though Scotland's rich Celtic lore and cryptic mysticism. Brave is a criminally underrated installment in the Pixar cannon that I hope grows in stature over the years. If Wreck It Ralph is Disney doing Pixar, Brave is Pixar doing Disney."
1244,tt1217209,5,"Despite many negative views, I decided to watch this movie, mainly due to boredom but also I do love all things Celtic and mythical.I won't go into as much detail as I have with some reviews but just highlight the good, bad and in-between points as I saw themFirstly, the good: The animation is gorgeous as is the music. I love the backdrop and can related to the freedom of climbing cliffs and standing under waterfalls etc as I have done these things and felt incredible.As someone who loves nature and freedom I felt the main character Merida was not so unbelievable. I actually can relate well to the strenuous relationship she has with her mother and her father being stuck in the middle keeping the peace. The story line starts off very well and has a nice heartwarming and resolved if not predictable ending.There is a good sense of myth, moral and culture which is rare in movies these days. The story is simple but quite clever in a way that everything does still link nicely together if you really look at the imagery. I understand the original title was not ""Brave"" but ""The Bear and the Bow"" which is more what it says on the tin but hey. There IS bravery, physical bravery in tackling ones enemies in combat-but also the emotional-to face your own misgivings and admit you are wrong, to be willing to change your close and comfortable outlook on life and take risks,and to always stand up for what you believe in no matter what. Shame some people seemed to have missed this point.The not so good:I felt the story line was too predictable (good for kids maybe but adults will guess it almost from the off) and things just fall into place too easily,even the end ""battle"" is resolved far too quickly & easily. Also, sadly as time advance it becomes a little too silly & gimmicky in parts (Did we really need the naughty siblings- and did we REALLY need them becoming bears!?)or the stock neurotic overweight maid and clumsy,easily swayed but well meaning side characters? Shame because while bringing some comedic relief,all were quite forgettable and served as a tired cliché this movie could have soared without.It lacks the epic standing the trailers promised. Also, the men are depicted as blundering fools with no looks, sense,or charisma, the ladies- yep, the opposite.(However- it was refreshing to see this in a way as many animations have shown women as weak and feeble totally relying on men and princes- Merida not only does not rely on her version of Mr charming-she shuns the very notion of losing her freedom!)SO,to sum up- Slightly lacking substance but still a very good family movie.Aesthetically striking,nice and light hearted but with some more moving lesson on attitudes and the value of your friends and loved ones."
1245,tt1217209,3,"This film is very beautifully done, the artists, great job. The storyline was terrible. It was another balled up Disney movie that seemed like it was just trying to fit in every single cliché and Disney trademark as it could. It starts as it should, epic. Then out of nowhere the epic Celtic music begins and the female vocals come in. I immediately wanted to leave. The girl I was with, also seemed exhausted with this as well. It didn't need that, it made the film go from really cool to chick flick.Little did I know, it was going to get worst. The trailer explained the movie as a hero rising, and the changing of fate. Who doesn't like that. So she rides off mad at her mom, finds a witch and requests her fate to be changed. She is granted her wish and her mom is turned into a bear. Yes, a bear. So the entire movie, basically is the main girl trying to mend her moms relationship and turn her back into a human. Well, that's not hard, because the love is already there. She basically apologizes and is sad about everything. and obviously, in the nick of time, the sun, which could consequently keep her a bear, shines light on the two and magically she turns back into a human (which isn't as cool as I'm making it seem). The plot was a total deviation from the trailer, it made no sense, and it was more for little kids than the usual Pixar film, which for the most part is usually made for a wide audience.After the film, I couldn't leave fast enough. I hope people enjoy the film, I just didn't. Nor would I recommend seeing it. I was throughly disappointed, but I'm curious on what others think. So feel free to email me at ryanhartford86@yahoo.com"
1246,tt1217209,1,"I love The Incredibles, Up, Shrek, Toy Story, Monsters Inc., Despicable Me and Megeaman. I thought I was going to see something that amazing, but with a female protagonist. But no. It was the same old Disney princess movie: a princess having problems about who she is or is not going to marry. We saw that in Snow White, Seeping Beauty, Cinderella, The Little Mermaid. Apparently, that all females ever do: fret about who they are going to marry.Spoiler alert.The movie starts out great: funny characters, great scenery, Scottish accents, and a promising protagonist. I'm sucked in and expecting something amazing and interesting, like the other Pixar movies. Then, of course, since it is the Dark Ages (and Disney, not ""really"" Pixar), the hand of the princess will be the prize in a contest. Been there, done that. Of course she doesn't want that, so she runs away and finds a witch and asks the witch to change her . . . her . . . fate? Like the trailers said? No. She wants to change her MOM. The princess does not want to grow and mature, she want's mom to quit bugging her. Mom has done everything she can to give the princess a wonderful life and educate and prepare her for a life of queen-ship. But that's not what the princess wants. The princess wants – what? She really has no viable alternative. It's not like she can go and get a career. The movie implies that if she gets married, she can't ride her horse or shoot her bow any more. Why not? So they parade out the three husband candidates and of course, even though they are the sons of great chieftains, they are all worthless. Predictable, boring plot. What if one of them was handsome, charming, and a good archer, then she might not have minded getting married and we could have seen the wedding in 3D.Back to the witch. Well, the witch only knows ONE spell: change it into a bear. That's a big help. The last person who bucked conformity and wanted to do his own thing, he got changed into a wild, destructive bear too. Is that one of the lessons in this movie? Conform or you will become a wild, destructive, shunned animal? When her mother eats the magic cake and begins to feel sick, all the princess can think about is if she still has to get married. What if the magic cake killed her mom? The princess doesn't seem too worried. Is this one of the lessons of the movie? If your parents are trying to do the very best for you, and it's cramping your style, just drug them to get them off your back. After mom turns into a bear, there was no plot any more. It was just running around like Bugs, Daffy and Elmer in the forest and the castle until it was time for the movie to end. BORING.Then there was the big speech the princess gave in the banquet room about ""Can't we all just get along?"" What was that about? Everyone was partying and getting along just fine. Lame.So the princess cries and tells mom that she's sorry (of course she is now that everything's a mess), and mom turns back into a person. But who has the character arc? Not the princess. The princess still does not want to get married. MOM is the one who changes, and she had better! After all, she knows that if she leans too hard on her daughter to do what's best, the daughter will drug her. So is that the lesson in the movie? Don't pressure your kids to do what you know is best for them, or they could get punitive. So mom caves in and says the young people can chose by falling in love. There's a ground-breaking moral. News flash: western women have not been getting betrothed for centuries.And why did they call the movie ""Brave"". The Princess didn't do anything brave in the whole movie. In fact, she had a hissy fit, ran from her responsibilities, and turned to drugs to solve the problems.I don't care if it was 6 years in the making, or how amazing the 3D effects were: the story was a dud."
1247,tt1217209,5,"I knew Brave was in trouble from the first few words spoken in voice over as the film began. Merida (Kelly Macdonald) uses the words ""fate"" and ""destiny"" interchangeably. This muddle is at the heart of the film's problem.What's the difference between fate and destiny? Philosophers through the ages have distinguished the two based on choice. Fate is something that happens TO you. Destiny is something that happens BECAUSE of you.Fate is at the root of such words as ""fatal"" and ""fatalistic."" It implies LACK of choice. Philosopher Rollo May says fate is what we are born into, something that cannot be changed and that we have no control over, such as race.May says destiny is what we create based on what we were given. Destiny is all about CHOICE. It's what we choose to do with what we have.Merida is born a princess. She can't change that. Her mother, Queen Elinor (Emma Thompson), is grooming Merida for a role as future queen. After a long series of wars King Fergus (Billy Connolly) has united the four clans. Merida's duty is to help keep the clans unified though a judicious marriage.Merida is a wild rebellious child with special talent as a rider and archer. The demonstrations of her skills are absolutely breathtaking. She is unique and extraordinary and initially looks very much like a Power of Idealism character.These kinds of characters are driven by their passion. They abhor what they consider to be a mundane, boring, or mediocre life. They want to seize some grand destiny that is uniquely theirs.Well-drawn female protagonists in this vein are: Paikea (Keisha Castle-Hughes) in Whale Rider and Jess Kaur Bhamra (Parminder Nagra) in Bend it Like Beckham. Unlike Paikea or Jess, Merida doesn't fight for what she believes is HER destiny. Merida, instead, decides to change her mother! Perhaps this is because Merida has no clue about what she is really called to do.Now the story gets even muddier. With the help of an old witch's spell Merida does indeed change her mother — into a bear.Instead of figuring out who she is and what she uniquely is called to do, Merida must again deal with who her mother is. In the struggle over the middle part of Brave, Queen Elinor becomes the protagonist.The definition of a protagonist, in my book, is the person who makes the biggest emotional sacrifice in the story. It is the person who undergoes the most profound transformation. This is clearly Elinor on every front.Queen Elinor is a Power of Conscience character. She is a strict and demanding taskmaster, a perfectionist, and is driven by a strong sense of tradition and duty. Over the course of the story she recognizes her daughter's uniqueness and fully appreciates Merida for who she is.The first important glimpse of Elinor's change of heart is the brawl in the great hall after Merida has disappeared. When Merida strides back into the hall it is Elinor who puts words in Merida's mouth. Elinor speaks through her surrogate about going against tradition and marrying for love. It is Elinor who makes an eloquent plea for choice and following one's heart. Merida is just her passive interpreter. At the end of the film Elinor is willing to sacrifice her own life in a battle with the ancient cursed bear, who one would assume, was the monster who took off her husband's leg. Or not? Who knows?Even more confusingly this monster turns out to be the legendary brother, it would seem, who destroyed the ancient kingdom so long ago because of his pride and selfishness. How how did he turn into a bear? Was it mother love or something else that breaks his curse?When a legend and curse is set up so carefully it should have a pay-off having to do with Merida or her destiny– if the film is really about Merida.And what does Merida do that is so brave? She scurries around looking for the witch's house after her mother turns into a bear. She stitches up (with big clumsy childish stitches) the tapestry she slashed separating her from her mother. She does a lot of running away and running around. She is ineffective in battling the monstrous cursed bear. And she collapses in tears remembering her mother's loving kindness as the second sunrise threatens to make her mother's bear curse permanent. In other words, she acts like a child– or worse a girl.At the end of the film, Elinor has changed but not Merida. Merida is the same galloping wild child as she was in the beginning. It is a sinking back into carefree childhood rather than striding toward an adulthood based both on duty and and an individualistic sense of self. If you are a young woman, what is the lesson here?Brave offers no alternative vision of how Merida might help unify the clan in some way that is uniquely hers. It provides a very unsatisfying resolution. How has Merida changed or grown? What happens when King Fergus and Queen Elinor are too old to rule? What is Merida's role going forward? What exactly is her destiny?For the full review go to my website ETBscreenwriting."
1248,tt1217209,3,"I felt compelled to write a review to counter all the excellent reviews that this movie has received.It is not excellent, in fact it is dull, celebrates disobedience and feels like two completely different stories taped together to make up the time.I can't really see the point of the movie, young girls in Scotland today (or the USA or even South Africa)are not forced to marry, in the tenth century when they were it was accepted and not the great drama made out in the movie.The whole movie reeks of feminist fantasy- wanting to live in a romantic Scottish medieval setting, sorting out mother issues and having modern rules and standards.I found it disturbing that every male character in the movie was portrayed as at best, big stupid and loving, (King Fergus) at worst violent and evil (the bear). They only males given any intelligence in the movie are the triplets, who are constant thieves, conniving, ruthless, destructive and very small! The basic story and message was if you are a young woman with serious mother issues, don't worry. Do something really nasty to your mother, then say you are really sorry then your mother will change her mind and you can have it all your own way! Don't worry about any men involved as they are too stupid to understand what is going on.A lot of this I could have forgiven if the movie did not feel so disjointed, and in the second half frankly boring. This is not ""How to train your dragon"" with a female lead (that would have been great) this is a feminist Disney ""Mother bear"" done very beautifully by Pixar, with great voice acting but ultimately very unsatisfying."
1249,tt1217209,4,"Pixar execs used to say that the story was indispensable in their filmmaking. They were right. It is too bad they didn't follow their own advice in making Brave. As a formulaic Disney movie, it would be average (though with above average visuals). But our family (kids' ages from 10 to 18) doesn't bother seeing formulaic Disney movies anymore. We saw it yesterday, and everyone was disappointed. ""Cliche,"" one of our children said. ""Easily the worst Pixar movie I've ever seen,"" said another (though none of us has seen Cars 2). I chuckled once.Even though the moral of the story is that we're free to change our fate, the stock Disney characters were firmly locked into their roles and we could see the ending coming less than halfway through. I'm sorry I saw it at all.In a wonderful documentary called ""The Pixar Story,"" John Lasseter tells the story of how Disney suits almost ruined ""Toy Story,"" which had to be remade radically in order to be saved. It feels like this time the Disney suits succeeded.Is this a sign of things to come? Has Pixar been domesticated? With tickets so ridiculously priced, I'm not going to a theater next time to find out. We'll wait and rent."
1250,tt1217209,3,"Animation is spectacular, great setting in the Scottish Highlands. Voice acting is above par. However, this movie is not among the top Pixar films, by far. I felt the sickening presence of Disney all over the film -- weird politically correct preaching, overdone action scenes, and generally random and weird plot.The story is really disappointing. What exactly makes her 'BRAVE'?? They should have named the movie 'PETULANT'. She's selfish, and the entire plot is about how she can get out of the results of her selfishness while remaining selfish. The magic feels out of place, lots of wasted scenes, and the whole bear thing was just plain annoying after a while.Not a lot of funny moments, and generally boring! I was really looking forward to this movie, and I did not like it."
1251,tt1217209,4,"Mix Brother Bear with almost any princess film and this is what you get. The characters (surprisingly for Pixar) were poorly developed; this is especially true for the mother, where I was expecting some kind of back story, or at least a more believable development of the mother-daughter relationship. But no, apparently you're best buddies again and the mother will just change her mind on everything she believed previously, through a single fish-catching montage. ...Really? And don't get me started on 'the bad guy'. This 'evil bear' appears in only two scenes - one in which they escape from him, and one in which he returns and then gets squashed by a rock. In fact, the story would have been almost identical had the 'bad guy' been cut out of the script entirely.Perhaps you could blame the complete underdevelopment of the plot and characters on the relatively short runtime (100 minutes, minus the equally disappointing 'short' at the beginning). But that wouldn't make sense, as Toy Story 3, a brilliant film, had the same running time.I suspect that they are cutting back their effort on all fronts (writing, production time) bar animation, knowing full well that people will pay for their films regardless, so 'why bother?'.Following the equally mediocre Cars 2 with this, it's clear that Pixar really needs to step up their game.So please, do not support the decline of a once great film studio."
1252,tt1217209,1,"What a fantastic film that has gotten such a terrible backlash.Reasons for backlash:1)People hate princess films and according to them it is the same as the others. Well anyone with an iota of intelligence will tell you that each princess film has a different story, a different message and a different but ever so present soul. We live in a society where two characters who have the same hair color and different faces and different personalities are viewed by the masses of people to be identical and the same person because people are superficial and so this film has a princess and that one SINGLE fact makes the film the SAME as all other princess films. Oh how intelligence has plummeted.2) This is story about tradition and myth. That is part of the core of the tale. We live in a society with no tradition or real culture other than pop culture. So obviously the turmoil of the leads will go over the heads of the masses. I have friends who have been in situations where they were forced to marry someone and refusal to do so would have ghastly consequences for their families. It is real and heart breaking. In our society however people sleep with a hundred people before and even after marriage and can marry and divorce as they please without giving a rat's ass for their families who could suffer the brunt of their decisions. We live in a selfish society so obviously putting ourselves in the shoes of or even imagining what Merida and her mother go through and their reasons will not register with millions. No one will understand how breaking tradition could have disastrous consequences. They have no idea how in other countries how tradition and culture is a backbone of societies other than ours. people cannot in our society put themselves into the shoes of others as we are too selfish. And that is the truth.3) This story has legends and stories, myths, tales that guide our heroines. In a society without stories that date thousands of years, cautionary tales and tales of truths to guide us, i doubt the impact of that will reach the minds of the public. Though abroad many and i mean many nations have tales, legends that date back thousands of years before our country received its name. These tales would guide people and be sources of moral and brainy wisdom for the children and adults. So obviously that went over everyone's heads. People in other countries hundreds upon hundreds of years ago used these legends and myths, these tales, to grow as a people.And to this day people in such countries still tell these tales to their kids as a moral message, teaching and preventing history from occurring.4) Apparently it has no humor and people want humor over substance. I mean anyone seen The Hangover trilogy. Well people loved it as it shows what society is all about and that is public mindset.5) It is about a mother-daughter story, it has moral messages and a lot of deep meaning. Apparently that means it is 'cliché'. What an overused word by the pseudo intellectual pretentious idiots who lack profound sense and think substance and sweetness is cliché just because they are sick douches. Half the time they don't even know what it means. I mean these days the word cheesy is used to describe anything with substance, sweetness, kindness, soul and love. And so something with profound wisdom and sheer lovely heart is considered cheesy while on the other hand depraved psycho disgusting buffoonery is considered amazing. Oh how far moral and substance has fallen in this society and how pretentious pseudo-intellect has taken over. Wisdom and profound thought and substance is dead or according to the depraved superficial and supposedly know it all generation 'cheesy'. Our society is so egoistic and full of itself that it cannot be educated or told great messages since according to them, they know everything and no one should dare question that by putting a real message in a movie. Even if these people know nothing they still must be considered to be the greatest and smartest. People hate their families or have been so poorly raised and some in favor of pets or vice versa where pets are considered better family than people so obviously their hate for the real meaning of life and family and love which they look down upon is 'cheesy' and 'cliche'. Well that is society for you and i hope that great movies with substance don't get the boot in favor of what such people want."
1253,tt1462769,7,"When I first saw the previews for this film, I was on the fence about seeing it. To me, it looked like it could be a pretty good movie, or an absolute train wreck. Then I read the reviews, which weren't very good, and I was less sure about seeing it. A few days ago, I saw it out of boredom at a cheap movie theater. As I began to watch the film, I realized that the movie was very uplifting and emotional, with lots of other feelings. I can admit, I cried during the film and I think everyone else in the theater did too. This movie wasn't all perfect though. It was very predictable, and when something happened in the middle of the film, I could basically tell how it would end. All in all, I walked out of the theater feeling good, and I hope to see it again soon.A word of advice, DO NOT LISTEN TO THE REVIEWS OF THIS MOVIE. The Odd Life of Timothy Green is a great family movie to see, and it really gives you that warm feeling when you leave the theater."
1254,tt1462769,1,"What a wonderful movie! Because you can read the summary, I will just tell you our reaction to it. We were lucky enough to receive tickets to a pre-release screening of this moving. We took the whole family, 5 boys ages 5-16, and my husband and myself. Everyone loved it. Even the 5 year old, and that is no small thing. This movie will make you laugh and cry and then laugh again. And the laughing moments range from chuckles to totally surprise you as they burst out of your chest howls out loud. Though we have our boys, we are waiting to adopt a girl, so the theme of parents who want a child that they can't seem to have, and the theme of taking in a child that you didn't give birth to and/or adoption really hit home for us. I sat at the end of the movie and cried, and they were tears of laughter and sadness and hope all mixed up together. Even if you're not interested in adoption, this is really a touching show. I wish Disney made more movies like this. Totally clean, nothing even remotely possibly offensive, and yet it wasn't just a kid show. It was interesting, engaging, witty. As noted above - good for everyone from ages 5 to 40!"
1255,tt1462769,7,"I like Peter Hedges' other films. I wish I could have liked this more. Its' heart and message are so in the right place, but it plays like a schmaltzy movie of the week. Jennifer Garner, whom I have really enjoyed in other roles, overplays this one and is very disappointing. The kid who plays Timothy is good enough. His young female friend Odeya Rush is the best in the cast. Joel Edgerton is perfect for Lifetime movie of the week. They are all really likable. So I just wished I liked the film more. And the message is terrific. I cry in schmaltzy films but I think it says much about this film in that the only time it brought any tears was in the final scene which was grounded in reality. When the fantasy was going I just wasn't sucked in.7 may be a generous rating, but this is a solid family film with a strong positive message. There is a big audience out there for this film. I don't really want to discourage them from seeing it."
1262,tt1462769,1,"Do not believe the positive ratings of this movie!!!Don't waste your time or money on it. It is beyond bad, it is an insult to intelligence.The screenplay is so naive (typical wishful thinking... literally) it's painful to watch. Even someone equipped with a bottom IQ can predict what will happen at any time and the characters are so clichés that it made my eyes roll in disgust. It also goes right into the same category as Benjamin Button, banging head first into the wall of unacceptable temporary suspension of disbelief. One can never get into the story because the particulars that one has to take for granted are not only delusional (which just might be accepted with some airtight explanation, fantastic or not), but also summarily and very naively dealt with. I also wish to point out that nowhere on the planet would you be authorized to obtain a child in adoption with the kind of story given to the government agency in the movie. Stay away from this one. It's sheer lunacy... not for intelligent people."
1256,tt1462769,7,"Something is missing from this movie. By all means, this should had been a great, entertaining and heartfelt, modern fairy tale, for the whole family to enjoy but the movie handles certain themes poorly and make some odd choices with its story at times.And honestly, I still foremost really liked the movie. It's harmless and cute enough still and the movie has its moments. But that doesn't take away anything from the fact that this movie still is being a bit of a missed opportunity.All of the right intentions were there, it just didn't always worked out successfully. The approach they were going for was a heartfelt family movie, in which a mysterious young boy brings people together and changes their lives for the positive. It just happen to do it all in a wrong way, for most of the time. First of all; it does far too little with its mystery/fantasy aspects. They accept the boy for who he is and where he came from pretty early on- and easily. Besides, it all seems like the boy is doing very little special actually, as if the movie was afraid it would loose some of its viewers if it was going to be more heavy on its fantasy aspects.That perhaps was the movie its biggest problem; it wasn't heavy on its fantasy. The movie rather picks some uninteresting plot developments instead. It prefers to be about pencils, as opposed to something more heartfelt or bigger than life. It seems like the movie still wanted to be about morals and wanted to teach you about life but it mostly does so by inserting stereotypical characters and some forced or formulaic dramatic moments. It's not as warm and emotional involving as this movie required to be, in order for it to let it all work out.I am also still a bit confused about it who this movie was aimed for. It seems to be a bit too slow and uninteresting for young children and not convincing enough for adults. It's a bit in between of being an entertaining children's movie and a modern fairy tale for adults. I did wished they had balanced certain things out a bit better, so the movie would had been better and more fun to watch for both adults and youngsters. The movie is still being fine as it is. I mean, all the things I had problems with didn't ruined the movie for me in any way and I could certainly still enjoy and appreciate it for what it was. It's cuteness factor and innocence still make this a recommendable film. Just don't expect to be very taken- or blown away by any of it.7/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
1257,tt1462769,1,"Okay,so this movies is about this couple who can't have children but one day they discover that a boy grew in their garden and they decide to adopt him.At first this may sound pretty harmless,but trust me,it's not!First let me tell you the thing which bothers me the most at this movies-the parents are awful,they barely interact with Timothy,they won't appreciate him unless he comes out as a winner in the front of their families and bosses and they won't even let him have any friends!I really can't blame this on the actors,hell even the kid tried his best,but this script is so dumb and the worst part is:the parents didn't learn anything from this experience!I'm not kidding,they even tell the adoption center that they didn't really learn from their mistakes but will make new mistakes instead!And still,the adoption center gives them a kid!Seriously people,I do understand that you have a different opinion,but I really don't get what's so heartwarming about this movie,it says that bad parents should be allowed to have kids too as long as they will do different mistakes,not learn from their previous ones!"
1258,tt1462769,6,"Although this movie is not much of a box office success, due to the heavy load of drama, sensitivity and all the mushy-mushy stuff, I still say it is nice to see things go well sometimes, makes you feel that the world is not that bad.Walt Disney still brings a little magic into our lives trying to make you feel the world is not that much of a sad place. Peter Hedges the director and co-writer of the film did a nice job with this movie, which doesn't have lots of special effects but delivers the hallmark family fun that Disney is known for, Peter finds a way to draw your sensitivity out and make you develop an emotional attachment to the characters from the movies first scene of parents struggling to have a child to when a naked kid shows up and then all the way till the end.The odd life of Timothy green is about a couple Cindy and Jim Green (Jennifer Garner and Joel Edgerton), who couldn't have children. The couple has done all they can to get pregnant but all to no avail, so they began to dream about what their child would be like, they wrote down all they wished he would be, achieve and become, placed it in a box and buried it in the backyard.One stormy night young Timothy (CJ Adams) shows up on their doorstep and calls them mum and dad.CJ Adams was exceptional in his task as Timothy Green, child actors seem to have a difficult role sometimes when they have to convince you, but CJ did a good job and I was impressed by his acting.As Adams plays young Timothy who sees life differently; hey! He has leaves growing on his ankles, he likes to spread his hands in the sunlight, he is naïve and truthful to a fault.The movie's story had some loops here and there, but it was fun to see how things planned to turn out, although some can boast that the movie was a little predictable but it was also lovable. I won't burst the kids from school to go see this movie, but if you do catch it on TV gather the family around for a fun time."
1259,tt1462769,9,"If you remember the good old days when the story was in the forefront and people dedicated months and years into character development then yes this film is for you. With the way Hollywood has become a sci-fi shoot em slash em industry films with heart and simplistic storytelling get lost in the fray but are very necessary. It starts out slow and on the nose but once timothy shows up the film shines. You find yourself engulfed into the couples life and not wanting the show to end. When you feel like you know the story and the characters then that means you watched a great film. As film makers and critics and people with the option to voice that instantly its very easy to forget that hey the reason you arnt rushing to see the film or tell people about it is because they did their job so well you felt like you knew them. It is easy to see a film and break down cuts, and fades and length of scenes but this film was one of those ones where you didn't care if it was formulaic at parts or if it was too heartfelt and sappy in others. It was such a joy that simple and deep character development still happens and its an artform I hope we never lose."
1260,tt1462769,4,"This Disney fantasy is way too sugary sweet and predictable for my tastes. It stars Jennifer Garner, Joel Edgerton, and C J Adams, as Timothy.Garner and Edgerton are a married couple living in the small town of Stanleyville. The town is idyllically beautiful and it has as its' main enterprise a local pencil factory. The factory has been owned for generations by the Crudstaff family.However, due to the economic times the factory is in danger of closing. Edgerton works at the factory while Garner is employed at the Crudstaff House and Pencil Museum as a guide.The film is told in flashbacks as the couple are being interviewed to be adoptive parents. They are relating their magical experiences with Timothy Green to the counselors.Having been told by their fertility doctor that they cannot have children, they decide that night to write down all the wonderful qualities they would have liked their child to have. They put the papers in a metal box and bury it in the backyard. During the night, a huge rainstorm hits and suddenly a young boy--Timothy--magically appears in their home.Guess what? He possesses all the characteristics that they had written down and will follow the path that they had envisioned for him. However, there's one big caveat. He has leaves attached to his legs and in time as the leaves are shed one by one you can guess what will be the end result.I'm puzzled why the makers of the film decided to make many of the supporting cast such unlikeable characters. Garner's sister, portrayed by Rosemarie DeWitt is self-centered and fairly obnoxious while Edgerton's father, played by the wonderful actor Robert Morse, is basically a macho bully. Also, pretty much the entire Crudstaff family (Dianne Wiest and Ron Livingston in particular) are quite mean-spirited.Not all the supporting characters are unlikeable. Odeya Rush plays a young girl who befriends Timothy when no one else will. She shows him what is apparently a large red birthmark on her shoulder, which has caused her to be kind of an outcast as well.All in all, this film may appeal to youngsters, who will ignore the schmaltz, a lot more than it appealed to me. Also, possibly to adults who like these type of complete sweet fantasies."
1261,tt1462769,1,"The whole feel of this movie is annoying, the acting is sub par, the humor uncomfortable. Jennifer Garner is obnoxious and simple, she seems to just accept this dirt boy as normal and allows him to just do normal things without even checking if he as something wrong with him or carries diseases. The father is an absolute dolt. Why is the girl, who is so much older than Timothy in the same grade? The scene with him drawing the mothers boss is just silly. The music scene with the WAR song is incredibly stupid. The soccer scene made me want to pull my hair out. These overbearing moronic parents are unwatchable. Everyone at the pencil company meeting just accepts that he has leaves growing out of his legs without question. Worst line of the movie....""If this boy can have a leaf on his ankle, then we can make a pencil out of leaves, lets get to work!"" That makes no sense and neither does this film. Then they get to adopt a child even though they tell this insane story.This pointless waste of time may be the worst movie I have seen in a decade."
1302,tt0093748,9,"I'm not sure who is responsible for bringing Steve Martin and John Candy together,but they are a genius in my book,and they were brought together with just the right material.This comedy from John Hughes is without question his best work as a director. I look at this film as a modern day Laurel and Hardy romp,which, incredibly was not included in the AFI's Top 100 comedies.It will cause you tears,both from laughter and it's touching ending.It is about two very different ways of life,clashing in the beginning, but slowly coming together from the realization they we are all human,despite our differences.It is becoming a tradition at the Williams household to view this movie every Thanksgiving.It is a must see,must own film. Thumbs up."
1263,tt1142977,7,"Judged as a comedy, Frankenweenie isn't really that great. The humor is rarely more than mild. But the movie actually did a pretty good job with the story, which is well paced and has moments of genuine - if mild - suspense. It's also - and this is to be expected from any Tim Burton movie - really good looking, with stylish black and white animation and a cast of creepy looking kids.As someone familiar with the original movies, I appreciate the way it pays tribute to its source material. It is also wonderfully imaginative, most notably in the first resuscitation scene.One criticism; even by the standards of kids cartoons or old horror movies, this thing makes zero sense. The lack of any sort of logic is, however, so in-your-face that I accept it as purposeful and thus just accept that this is a movie that's not supposed to make any sense."
1264,tt1142977,7,"With its cute, yet, decidedly creepy-looking characters, and all, I thought that Frankenweenie was a pretty darn good ""Mad Scientist"" story that's sure to be a hit with audiences of all ages.Containing some very nice touches of warped humor, grotesque horror and several arousing moments of pathos (cleverly injected into its weird, but oddly wonderful, little tale), Frankenweenie has proved, once again, that director Tim Burton still has the master's touch when it comes to making stop-motion, animated films that seem to emerge from the very depths of the dark-side.If nothing else, Frankenweenie certainly turned out to be a lovingly-charged homage to a variety of classic horror, monster, and Sci-Fi pictures from those glorious days of yesteryear.All-in-all, Frankenweenie certainly had its share of flaws, but, just the same, I certainly hadn't expected to enjoy this film as much as I did.Appropriately filmed in b&w, thank goodness that it didn't contain any musical numbers."
1265,tt1142977,6,"If anywhere there was a braver ending needed, it's here. Kids could have learned that life is but fleeting, we all suffer heartbreak sooner or later, say goodbye to the ones we love... This is an important lesson indeed. But, no. In the interest of a few mums and dads having to tolerate some waterworks on the way home from the cinema, Burton decides to go for what is essentially a cop out. Rather cowardly, if you ask me.The whole film has the feel of an old B movie (but is set in the present day) as it is shot entirely in black and white and contains more than one horror reference. Spookiness pervades the atmosphere, as Danny Elfman's Gothic score meanders in the background like a funeral march. Poor Victor loses his dog, and his mourning and subsequent resurrection of his pet carries real emotion weight.This doesn't last though, as the plot stretches to Victor's classmates experimenting on other deceased creatures, turning them into freaks of nature that invade the town. This is an arresting spectacle, but a betrayal of what transpired before... turning the movie from a personal tale about a boy and his half-dead canine, into an OTT monster movie. It feels like a different film, and not one that matched up to the poignant first half.Not for one minute would I suggest I could tell Mr Burton how to do his job. But I think less action, and more storytelling would have improved the final reel no end... As well as a more courageous conclusion. Oh well, everyone's a critic (Most don't enunciate their thoughts as well as I do, though)... ;) 6/10"
1266,tt1142977,1,"Tim Burton has been a very hit or miss director for me,for the most part I prefer his earlier films,but then this comes along and changes all my expectations. I'm a giant fan of monster and universal classic horror flicks, and also an animal lover,so this film just hits all the marks for me,like nothing else he has done. I adore all the characters,the Science teacher in particular just lights up the screen,but Sparky overwhelms them all,in the best way possible. Few films have managed to truly capture the sense of love and family between a dog and owner,this beautiful film just nails it. The wonderful,awe inspiring climax left my jaw on the floor,which is then combined with genuine emotions,it really is hugely satisfying,I truly love it."
1267,tt1623205,6,"Well, let's start with... The Good:The visual effects are 2nd to none. Raimi and his team have given their audience a bright and colorful world of wonder in a much more 'wowing' Land of Oz than that of the original film, and possibly even one that's more visually attractive than any other film to date. A very fun and crafty Rachel Weisz takes the role of Evanora and grips the audience with charm and viciousness in all the right doses. The supporting cast also performs pretty well, sometimes capturing that original 'Wizard of Oz' magic.The Bad: Going into this film with high expectations for the dialogue, & acting is going to leave you very disappointed. Two of the most featured roles of the film, Oz (played by James Franco) & Theodora, (played by Mila Kunis) are surprisingly and inexcusably portrayed very poorly. Franco's Oz is written to be about how you would expect him to be - complete with charm, wit, & deceit. However, the depth that you would expect to come with such an anticipated resurgence of a character is missing, & you can tell that Franco is having trouble buying into the role himself. The character quickly becomes stale at about 45 minutes in, and doesn't ever fully recover. Kunis feels the same - bored & devoid of passion for the lackluster lines given to her. Her character also has an issue with development, and is rushed from high to low so quickly that the audience doesn't have the opportunity to invest in her. The performances aren't the worst thing you'll ever see, but the lifeless script & awkward dialogue make it hard to stay focused. Even with a great script though, I feel as though Franco & Kunis weren't the best choices for their respective roles. The Ugly: The worst part of this movie is the story. It leaves you waiting for some kind of clever & unexpected plot twist, a little divulgence of the characters motivations, or even just some depth for the main focal points of the story. It's also somewhat obnoxious that this film takes elements of the original film that should have been left alone because the original film portrays Dorothy's entire journey as a dream in the end. (Such as transferring characters of ""the real world"" into characters of The Land of Oz) Without saying too much, I can tell you that this film is stuck somewhere between being a fun and family friendly revitalization of the original story and being a serious and intriguing fantasy film for a wide movie-going audience - and the formula just doesn't work. Having said all of that, I do not regret having gone to see Oz: The Great and Powerful, as the visuals do a great job of making up for everything that didn't work. I will warn you though, that the films run time of just over two hours can be difficult to sit through at times. Don't be afraid to take a bathroom break when it gets dry, you probably won't miss too much."
1268,tt1623205,8,"Oz the Great and Powerful tells the story of how the great wizard Oz from the Wizard of Oz came to be. It follows the young Oz (James Franco) as he is swept away to an enchanted land ending up in the middle of a power struggle between three witches. The young Oz is a trickster who deceives those he wants and/or needs for his own ends. This attitude has consequences and those consequences are what drives the story forward.James Franco plays the young Oz brilliantly. The character is a shallow small time magician and the story shows how he comes full circle to be the Great and Powerful Oz from the Wizard of Oz. Unfortunately, his change happens after taking a grievous toll. The three witches who Oz comes to affect are Theodora (Mila Kunis), Rachel Weisz (Evanora), and Glinda (Michelle Williams). The three play their parts and give great performances to add to their resumes. For those who watched and loved the Wizard of Oz in their childhood, this movie is the perfect prequel. Watching it as an adult was a treat. The writers did well to adapt the script to make it a worthy prequel. In addition, the movie does well to entertain both children and adults. It slots in perfectly as the precursor to the Wizard of Oz. The film didn't have the best reception but I encourage you to ignore this. The directing is probably the weakest link in this movie, but the story and actors more than makeup for this. The character development is amazing and shows exactly why things were they way they are in the Wizard of Oz. Simply stated Oz the Great and Powerful is truly a prefect prequel."
1269,tt1623205,9,"I went into this film prepared to be disappointed. Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland felt a bit lifeless to me (except for Johnny Depp's Hatter) and I couldn't help but compare this movie to that one in my head. So, I went and saw this one with reservations.I'm a huge Oz fan. I love the original books. I love the movie. I love Wicked (book and musical), Tin Man, Return to Oz, The Wiz (the musical more than the movie), and even Geoff Ryman's oh-so-depressing novel Was. There's no such thing as an ""official"" version of the story anymore, so I don't mind a little pastiche here and there. After all, Baum's Witch was short, wore an eye patch and a very tall hat, and brandished an umbrella, but Margaret Hamilton effectively erased that version in favor of the glorious green-skinned villain we all know and love. So talk of ""the real version of the story"" is pretty much moot at this point.This movie didn't disappoint me at all. Yes, it had some issues, but I didn't really mind overall. I left the theater with a big goofy grin and I'll probably go see it again. It was an enjoyable romp through a gorgeous landscape with enough insider references to merit multiple viewings. It rarely takes itself too seriously, and never tries to step on the toes of any other version of the story. There are references to events in the books which, before now, have never made it into any other adaptations (such as the China Girl), as well as many familiar visual cues from the 1939 film (the guard's outfits, the spiral where one fork of the Yellow Brick Road begins, and even a shot of the Kansas horizon with a scraggly grasping tree seem comfortably familiar). There was even a visual cue that, while it may not have been taken from this source, certainly suggested a character from Tin Man. I felt that Mila Kunis came across as a bit flat. Her character arc seems too forced and we don't really get to see much progression. I didn't mind James Franco, to be completely honest. He was appropriately sleazy when he needed to be and charming in a goofy way when needed. I think he could have invested his character with a bit more depth, but it never really turned me off his character at all. Superficiality is a huge part of his character, and I thought it worked, overall. The side characters were a delight, with some of the best comedic lines coming from Oz's traveling companions. And, of course, Rachel Weisz steals the show with a delicious performance, embodying a great number of classic villains from Snow White's Evil Queen to Star Wars' Emperor Palpatine.Visually, the film is a delight. Sam Raimi turns Oz into its own wonderland without it ever seeming predictable or tired. One criticism I had with Burton's Alice was that it didn't really give the audience a chance to luxuriate in the bizarre landscapes of Underland all that much. It had great character design, but the landscape seemed a bit low- key. Raimi, on the other hand, gives audiences exactly what they're looking for. Gems, flowers, waterfalls, mountains, rock formations, sunsets, etc. that are completely breathtaking. Not only that, but the CGI is crisp and clean.Danny Elfman's score was...OK. One thing I've noticed with him lately is that almost everything he does now sounds less and less unique. We've got the requisite haunting waltz and the spectacular pounding swirling opening credits theme, but other than that, I found almost everything to be a bit forgettable, which is sad because Elfman is one of my favorite film composers. The music isn't bad, but it just doesn't add as much as it could have. But overall, I really enjoyed this movie. It's a delightful romp through a colorful wilderness that asks nothing more from its audience than a chance to have fun. This isn't a thoughtful, complex Oscar-winner nor is it a gritty realistic fantasy a la Lord of the Rings or Game of Thrones. It's a kaleidoscopic portrait that seems at once familiar and new. Children will love it (though very young children may be scared by a few of the antagonistic creatures) adults will enjoy picking out all the loving homages to the books and the 1939 film. It's a fun way to spend an evening, and you won't be disappointed, just don't go in expecting deep, complex high fantasy. If you liked Burton's Alice, you will definitely enjoy this film (and you'll probably enjoy it more, if I may so myself)."
1270,tt1623205,4,"I'll keep this short.The movie was pretty average and the casting of Mila Kunis and James Franco was the nail in the coffin.Mila Kunis is just plain bad, wooden and awful in the role of Dizzydora or whatever. One of the worst performances I've seen. Really shockingly bad.Every time she opened her mouth I couldn't stop thinking ""Shut up Meg"".James Franco, as other reviewers have said, comes across as an unsympathetic, slightly creepy Oz. His performance is uneven to say the least. Over the top in some places, half asleep in others.Franco's ""likeable conman"" Oscar Diggs, entirely misses the mark, you won't hate him, but you won't give a crap what happens to him.The dialogue isn't strong, some of the visual effects are a bit dodgy and there are flaws in the direction. A strong performance from the leads could have easily saved this movie. Sadly, the terrible casting decisions rendered this film pretty much unwatchable for me."
1271,tt1623205,6,"Sam Raimi's prequel to L Frank Baum's Series of children's books plays greatly into Raimi's strengths as a director. A strong imaginary world that is covered in light and darkness and characters that inhabit that world with a quirky feel of childhood imagination. Raimi literally puts his heart and soul into this production and it shows, giving a festival of the senses with the viewer's imagination. While Raimi is working over time to make all of this work, a weak script and bad casting of two very important key roles set him back. The only thing that puts this film back on track is the game performances by two of the film's other actors, one in particular whose performance keeps this film from sinking from its own lack of depth.For what does not work, look no further than the script, which is not very well put together. Yes, it is a kid's film but kids are a lot more sophisticated than some of the dialog here and some of the kids in the audience I was with moaned a bit while hearing it. Moreover, yes, it is a prequel to a story that many people know, so there should not be any real surprises but that is no excuse to be lazy with the script and the scriptwriting is lazy here. What makes the problems with the script jump out here is some of the casting, which is just bad. A good actor is able to make a bad script some how work for their character; a bad actor only magnifies the scripts problems and makes their character look worse. Unfortunately, we have two actors completely wrong for their roles here and it only makes this movie even a bigger chore to sit throw. The first cinematic offense is the main character Oscar Diggs, who is not only the weakest character in the film but has an actor who just not believable in the role. James Franco can be a decent actor when he tries and he can be infuriatingly bad when he just stands there and not care about his performance, which he does here in this film. The character of Oscar Diggs is supposed to be the anchor of this film, a man that has to see the error of his ways in order to be the man that he is destine to be. However, thanks to Franco's lazy performance and the weakness of the script, we really cannot see the good in the character and is not impressed with his changed of heart when the time came to prove himself. Oscar comes across more as a sleazy opportunist than a man conflicted with his inner self and we cannot root for him at all. The character is wasted opportunity and really does not add to the story and thanks to Franco's inability to show sincerity with his role, we really do not care at all about poor Oscar or his problems. Another character we end up not caring for is the character of Theodora, who (Come on, the cat has been out of the bag for a while) becomes the Wicked Witch of the West. Thanks to the script and Mila Kunis inability to show range or any emotion outside of anger, we do not care about how this character loses her innocents to become the evil witch and we do not care what happens afterwords. While both Kunis and Franco fall flat on their faces performance wise, not all the actors fall by the waste side and some of them are able to transcend the weak script in order to gives performances than is able to salvage the good Sam Raimi tries to give to this film. The first one belongs to Michelle Williams, who plays Glenda the good witch and manages to give off the right kind of goodness and decency that her character needed to be believable with out the added fake sweetness. She is genuine and believable and is able to make her character work despite the weakness of the script. It also helps that Williams is an amazing actor with a lot of range and is able to tap into her strengths to achieve this feat. The best performance however belongs to the great Rachel Weisz, who almost single handedly saves this film from all of its shortcomings with a performance that not only transcends its weak script but also manages to be even better technically than the film as a whole. When the script keeps moving south, Its Weisz that keeps moving the film forward. She gives a fun and sassy performance that manages to make the character of Evanora much more than the standard fairy tale villain and manages to give off a level of understanding and complexity that does not talk down to its audience. It is a brilliant performance with a weak script and only the best actors manage to accomplish that feat with out breaking a sweat and Weisz does that effortlessly.While the script is weak and some of the performances pretty bad, it is the efforts of Weisz, Williams and Raimi that keeps it from falling off a cliff. For them only is the reason you should see this movie."
1272,tt1623205,9,"Unbalance prequel to the classic ""The Wizard of Oz"" has a lot to offer thanks to the directorial grace of Sam Raimi and the game performances of both Rachel Weisz and Michelle Williams. Unfortunately, their efforts are almost torpedoed thanks to a bland script that needed a lot more heart and the shocking miscasting of two of its major roles.First we should start with the look of the film, which is to my surprised tame considering the gluttony of CGI in today's films. Sam Raimi gives an old school feel to this film that manages to balance the right tone of epic nostalgia and childlike intimacy with a hint of Raimi's signature manic style of energy. It is a beautiful film to look at and it is very inviting. The character's looks all represent their personalities and the CGI animated effects for the imaginary characters match the feel and look of the film. From the childlike wonder of China Doll to the scary fanged flying baboon, Raimi manages to let them connect on a visual level with their environment and not for once that they over power the seamless look of the film. It is a beautiful, visual affair and that is all thanks to the grace that Sam Raimi and his ability to let the audiences feel their way around this beautiful world. Unfortunately, while this movie is beautiful to look at, not even Raimi's efforts are enough to cover over the fact that the movie's script is as bland as a stale cracker and some of the performances are just flat out bad. The story lacks punch and its barley passable as a narrative. The character's motives are flimsy at best and a hint of irony and complexity could have added a lot more to the film. It is only through the efforts of the movie's best actors (Rachel Weisz and Michele Williams) that give this film the fun, irony and complexity that the script does not manage to even give itself. Unfortunately, while Weisz and Williams are bring more than humanly possible to their perspective roles, both James Franco and Mila Kunis look like they rather not be there are all. The bad part is that both Franco and Kunis are so miscast that it makes you question the mentality of the casting agent who though that they were good choices for their roles.This leads me to the acting of this film, which is disjointed to say the least. James Franco has done good work in past films but here he just looks like he just does not care about his fellow actors or his performance. He looks like someone who just wants to cash a check and just cost by on what little he can do. He lacks charisma, charm and presence in the role of Oscar Diggs and the bad part is that he is the movie's lead character. Franco's attitude is well displayed on screen and it hurts the film and you end up wondering on why he was even cast in the first place. The same goes to Mila Kunis, who tries a bit harder than Franco on her performance but ends up almost as bad. She just does not have it in her to pull off the role of Theodora, who becomes the Wicked Witch of the West and her performance on screen shows that she is well aware of that. Therefore, she just gives up half way and leaves both Weisz and Williams to fend for themselves. This is not a bad thing when you think about it because both of them manage to hold the film above water while the script just falls flat, Franco continues to not care about anyone but himself and Kunis just does not bother.This leads me to the best parts of the movie, which are the performances of Rachel Weisz and Michelle Williams, who both should get overtime pay for keeping the film from self-destructing. Both actresses are probably the best we have working today and in this film, it shows. Weisz plays the oldest sister Evanora, who is the villain of the film and let me tell you, she is so much fun that its criminal and her performance is the best of the film. She gives the character of Evanora such a sassy, fun presence that you do not need Kunis to transform into the Wicked Witch of the west to get a charge, because Weisz does more with less and gets the job done. Her performance keeps the movie afloat and the viewer is more than happy to follow her, which is strange because she is the villain of the film and has more charisma and charm that the hero himself. The second best is Michelle Williams who plays Gilda, the good witch and manages to keep her character from going way too far with the sweetness and have a bit of an edge as well. Williams brings humanity to her performance and the film and gives a perfect foil to Weisz's evil Evanora. If Disney had any sense, a sequel or prequel to this film would have just both Weisz and Williams and leave out Franco and Kunis but I seriously doubt it.You should follow this yellow brick road just to see Sam Raimi give his all to this beautiful world and see on how good actors Rachel Weisz and Michelle Williams are in their roles but this road has potholes (Which are the script and the performances of James Franco and Mila Kunis) that cannot be avoided. Let's just hope you have good wheels to go around them to get to the good this film has to offer."
1303,tt0093748,1,"John Candy was a comic genius. He really was. Never was his talent on display better than it was in this film. John Hughes and John Candy went on to develop what I can only surmise was quite the friendship because Candy appeared in many Hughes films either as the star ( this one, Uncle Buck, Great Outdoors ) or with a cameo ( Home Alone, Vacation and a few others that I can't think of right now, but check the IMDb and you'll see that he did ). But of all the films that Candy did, including Stripes, I don't think he has ever been as good and as funny as he was in here. If there was any justice in the Academy ( and we all know that is an oxymoron, Academy and justice ) then Candy would have at least been nominated for best actor in 1987. I think Douglas won that year for Wall Street and he deserved to but Candy was brilliant in this film. It was a shame to see his career cut short because even in his bad films he was good. This is his best and most complete role. He will be missed but at least we have great roles like this to remember him by.Planes.... is a film about one man trying to get home for the American Thanksgiving. He is Neil Page and he is played with perfect smugness by Steve Martin. He is a work-a-holic and his lifestyle is that of many John Hughes family men that live in suburbia Chicago. He lives in a huge house, much like the one in Home Alone and Weird Science, and his family is a beautiful one that consists of a lovely wife and three kids. But he is never home and for all of his success professionally, it is the kind of family that although is together now, it may not survive the fast approaching 90's if Neil Page continues his ways.John Candy plays Dell Griffith. He is a jolly man, much like Santa Clause but without the beard and the old age. This is a man that carries a giant trunk around with him and is a constant chatter box. He is the kind of man that you know is good at sales, but on a lower level. He is too much of a slob to really be a corporate sales guy. Of course this Laurel and Hardy pair cross paths and from here on out Neil's simple task of getting home to his family for Thanksgiving is going to be a journey from hell.First of all he loses his cab in New York rush hour to Candy who unwittingly steals it from him, then he is bumped from first class and ends up sitting next to Candy on the plane. Then they are delayed because of weather problems and what do you know, they end up spending the night together in not only the same hotel, not only the same room but the same bed. This presents all sorts of comic possibilities and Hughes doesn't miss one of them. His comic timing and development of the two characters is brilliant. Some of the best scenes are when the two are bantering and Candy is verbally assaulted by Martin. Martin goes off and says that he is annoying to listen to and then he says this: "" You know I could sit through an insurance seminar and still look happy and the others would say how do you do it? And I would say, because I can take anything, I've been with Dell Griffith, and they'd say, "" I know what you mean. Whooooo, shower curtain guy! "" And as funny as that scene is, Hughes goes for more than the quick payoff of laughter. He then reminds you that this isn't just a comedy but a film with many layers and substance to it. Because the next scene has Candy delivering a monologue that almost makes you embarrassed for laughing at what Martin said.But truth be told, first and foremost, this is a funny, funny film. And if anyone has scene it, they will tell you about the airport scene where Page has lost his rental car and he comes back and does what we have all dreamed of doing ourselves, he goes ballistic on the person behind the desk, who subsequently is Grace, from Ferris Bueller's Day Off. She must have been fired by Ed Rooney and now rents cars at airports for a living. She plays a desk clerk that has decided to take the Thanksgiving holiday a little sooner that she is supposed to. Martin comes in and she starts by saying, ""Can I help you?"" Martin replies, ""You can start by wiping that f***ing dumbass smile off your rosy f@**ing cheeks. "" From there he goes into an F-Word filled tirade about how her company left him in the middle of f***ing nowhere with f****ing keys to a f***ing car that isn't f***ing there. It is one of the funniest moments that I have seen in any film because you don't expect it from a Hughes film.Planes... is a heart warming film about family, friendship and good will towards men. It is also a wickedly funny movie and it will stand the test of time and I think in 30 or 40 years from now, it may be looked upon as Hughes best film. Candy and Martin are wonderful in here and it is really a treat to watch them work together.10 out of 10"
1304,tt0093748,1,"The greatness and pure genius of ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"" is that, while it is uproariously hilarious, it also reveals great hurt and truth - unlike any comedy I have ever seen before or since. Scenes such as those in the Bravewood Inn are classics. The argument between Neal and Del is the turning point in the film, and it is the first time that the audience realizes that they are in for more than they thought they were. There are certain elements of tenderness, heart, agony, conflict, and heartfelt emotion in ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"" that make it transcend the genre. Steve Martin and John Candy don't just act; they embody themselves so deeply in their characters that it almost sets a standard for how comedic pairings should be. Line them up next to Chris Farley and David Spade and the differences are astronomical. Watching Steve Martin is like acting a comedian at the top of his game. Just watch his reactions. The facial reaction from Steve in response to Del's comeback in the Bravewood Inn is perfect; we understand what Neal is going through, and Steve Martin lets us know this by placing himself in a recognizable area. We also understand Del, and that is really the key to this movie: Being able to identify with both characters almost equally. How often can you say that about buddy pictures? I don't ever feel much sympathy for Chris Farley, if that means anything.John Candy remains one of the most underrated and underwritten film comedians of all time. Offered constant mediocre scripts during the eighties and early nineties, all the way up until his death in 1994, he could make the material something more, something watchable. I recently viewed ""Funny Farm,"" a painfully unfunny film to sit through. I imagined what John Candy could have done with Chevy Chase's role, and I found myself laughing. Why? Because John Candy can make anything watchable. Just how many times would you watch ""Summer Rental"" or ""The Great Outdoors"" if the lead actor was Jim Carrey?There's some important content in this film, but it is never overpowered by laughs, nor vice versa. They go hand-in-hand. I come back to the Bravewood Inn argument scene. After the hilarious, ongoing insults Neal throws at Del, Del responds and says, ""You wanna hurt me? Go right ahead if it makes you feel any better. I'm an easy target. Yeah, you're right, I talk too much. But I also listen too much. I could be a cold-hearted cynical like you, but I don't like to hurt people's feelings. So you go right on and think what you like about me. But I'm not changing. I - I like me. My wife likes me. My customers like me. 'Cause I'm the real deal. Whatcha see is whatcha get."" It's creepy how much dramatic, emotional and truthful subtext sneaks into this film, and yet it only makes it all the better for it. ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"" is my favorite Comedy, yes I know that I have said it before. But, it is a serious comedy that has both heart and is hilarious at the same time. Entertainment at it's best. And isn't that what movies are all about? 5/5 stars."
1273,tt1623205,5,"Mildly entertaining look at the origins of the characters from 'The Wizard of Oz"" has everything down pack. From great visuals to imaginative set pieces, this film has everything. Its does not have however a single interesting character outside of the film's main villain and her good witch sister. Not to mention the fact that its script is as thin as a sheet of paper and the plot reeks of a Star Wars prequel but with out the light sabers. Its main hero Oscar Diggs (Played by James Franco) is not interesting at all and it does not help matters that Franco is miscast and while Oscar is supposed to be a bit of a conman with a heart; Franco comes across more as a degenerate deviant with his performance. While Franco is sputtering out of control performances wise, it falls on his co-stars to pick up his slack and one of them is Rachel Weisz, who plays the oldest witch sister Evanora, who rules Oz with a velvet iron glove. She is manipulative and cunning and in my mind the best thing about this film. While most of the things in this film are mostly kids stuff, Weisz infuses her character with a wickedly sassy seductive charm that elevates this film past most of its problems. Her showmanship with the material is greatly appreciated, especially when after a while; you are getting quite annoyed with most of the characters in this movie, especially the computer generated ones. Another actor who picks up Franco's slack is Michelle Williams, who is very charming in a good girl kind of way and is the only actor in the film who can hold the screen with Weisz performance wise. The movie could have worked much better if it just had Weisz and Williams as the leads but unfortunately, its not and we have to suffer though Franco trying to be charming in a squirmy kind of way and suffer though probably the movie's worse offense, which is the character of Theodora played by Mila Kunis, who redefines the word ""Miscast"". Theodora is supposed to be innocent in this film and gradually lose her innocence to become (Spoiler) the iconic ""Wicked Witch of the West"". Unfortunately, Mila comes across as interesting as a block of wood in this film and her transformation towards the climax ends up being more funny in a very bad sort of way than revealing. It does not help matters that Mila looks as disinterested in her character as the audience is and a better actor with more range could have brought more to it.All and all, it had its moments but its problems weight it down."
1274,tt1623205,7,"A magician finds himself transported to the magical land of Oz, where witches, flying monkeys and yellow brick roads exist. He is mistaken for the saviour of Oz and must decide whether or not to stay and be king, or leave and find his way home.I love Sam Raimi, the man and his invented work with a camera are what made me want to get into filmmaking in the first place. So to see him handling big projects like this (and Spiderman) was a joy for me to see. Oz the Great & Powerful is a CGI heavy film that demands a creative eye behind the lens. After his work on big budget films like Spiderman, it seemed like an easy choice for Raimi to be the one behind Oz and for the most part, it works. The films shortcomings keep it from being really magical and memorable, like the original from 39, but Oz has enough whimsy to keep the kids entertained and the adults smiling. The land of Oz is indeed magical, with vibrant colours around every corner, memorable spots like the poppy fields and the dark forest for us older viewers, but even in saying all that I can't help but feel how fake it all is. This film suffers from the same troubles that plagued Burton's Alice in Wonderland, the visuals, although great for the story, add no sense of realism to the image. I hate overly used CGI in films to the point of noticing the awkward placement of actors in front of the green screen. The first major offender of this is Star Wars: Attack of the Clones, none of the actors made me believe they were in the settings they were. Both Wonderland and Oz have this same feeling. While I'm getting the negatives out of the way, I must say that what everyone is saying about Mila Kunis is true, she was miscast in this role. I think she was chosen more for her beauty and star power than her acting abilities, which is sad cause it looks like she really is trying here. The story for her character here is a sad one and the second half I think suffers a bit because the threat from her is not really present. I don't really know why I'm tip-toeing around the issue because those who know The Wizard of Oz, know that Dorothy kills one witch with her house and the other with water, leaving Glinda the good witch in a bubble as the saviour. Seeing the Kunis character go in the direction she does didn't really effect me as much as I wanted it to. Consider that the failure of the script more so than the actors. Not enough time is really given to her for her transformation to affect the viewer.The film opens in black & white and and the transformation to colour had a smile on my face. Despite the ""fakeness"" of some of the scenes (not all) Raimi does a decent job of not letting the effects overpower the film. Raimi steers the film in the right direction, but it is James Franco's shoulders it has to rest on. He is the type of actor that comes off as not really caring. It works in some films like Pineapple Express and he does manage to turn in some great performances, look at 127 days or Freaks & Geeks for that. Unfortunately I don't know if he has enough charisma and power to command a film like this. At times it looked like he was in the role, other times it felt like he couldn't care. Maybe it's his acting style, I can't really put my finger on it, but clearly Raimi sees something in him because he has worked with him previously on the Spiderman films. Where the acting does work, marvellously and in every scene is Rachel Weisz and Michelle Williams. Two polar opposites that look like they actually enjoy the characters and the movie they are in. They elevate the material a bit to make the drama more tangible. Whereas without them I think the film would have fallen more flat. The drama and character choices didn't really bring me into the story. The film didn't feel like it took chances, or tried to have complex situations for the characters. It had mapped out beats, hit them and marched on. It was nice seeing some nice Raimi touches in the final product. More than 25 years later and I still smile when I see Bruce Campbell getting hit in the face, knowing full well that it is Sam Raimi on the other end of the camera hitting him. Surprisingly, moments did indeed feel Evil Deadish to me, with the flying witches holding out their hands in a deadite possession form. But I digress. Oz is a good film, with weaknesses that bring it down. Raimi and two witches try their best to elevate some bland material and in the end we are left with a film that is neither great, nor memorable....just satisfactory enough."
1275,tt1623205,1,"I saw ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" in theaters on it's opening weekend and I loved it. This movie had heart, a good storyline, a well-written script, emotion and some intense moments. It's not as much a prequel to the 1939 classic ""The Wizard of Oz"" as much as it is a reboot of the ""Oz"" franchise that acts as a prequel to the novel ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"" by L. Frank Baum (not that I've read the novel). As a reboot, I think it did the source material justice. As a prequel, it actually answered some of my questions. I think the reason some people were disappointed by ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" is because they had high expectations for it. I actually had very low expectations going into it and I was surprised by it. I thought it was going to be ""Alice in Wonderland"" but set in Oz and without the only reason to watch it (Johnny Depp). From the trailers and TV spots, it looked like it was made to cash-in with ""Alice in Wonderland"". It was so poorly marketed. But I thought the movie was one thousand times better than ""Alice"". I've seen ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" three times now and I don't see why some people may hate it. Sure it's almost all CG (but then so were ""300"" and ""Avatar"" and no one gave a crap) and the cast consists almost entirely of celebrities (but then again, Judy Garland was a celebrity) so I can sort of understand why it may feel like a turn-off. However, I can't name a bad thing about the movie and most of my friends who have seen it really enjoyed it like I did. While James Franco wasn't the best choice for the Oz character, I think he pulled it off very well. I think it's a much better prequel movie than ""Star Wars: The Phantom Menace"" was. And I like ""Star Wars"" better than ""Wizard of Oz"" so I think that's saying something. ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" may not be a masterpiece or better than the classic but It's a ""great and powerful"" movie and if you haven't seen it, I highly recommend it. Don't listen to the haters. You're opinion is all that matters. I give this movie 10 stars out of 10."
1276,tt1623205,6,"Sam Raimi's excursion into the Land of Oz is somewhat of a sight to behold, with great sets and wonderful use of CGI that does not over power the senses or your cinematic tastes. Too bad for this film, bad casting decisions on two of the characters and a way too simplistic story sets it back somewhat. Raimi does not throw up too many computerize affects and a great deal of Oz is old school charm with grand sets and costuming. That benefits this film greatly and makes Oz a real cinematic treat. The performances are for the most part spot on with great turns by Rachel Weisz (Weisz has the most fun in her role) Michelle Williams, who gives a noble performance as Glenda the good witch and the third best belongs to the voice over of Zach Braff, who gives a funny performance as a talking monkey sidekick. With these performances and Raimi's technical savvy, the film almost takes off, almost. What keeps it from being any better is the story, which is fine but flimsy and predicable. Yes, it is a sort of prequel and you know what is going to happen but there are no surprises to be found here and most of the so-called surprises are ruined thanks to the marketing if you have been following this movie. Another factor that keeps this movie from soaring to better heights is some of the other casting, which is baffling to say the least. Mila Kunis is disappointing as the younger sister Theodora, who of course becomes the Wicked Witch of the West. No flare in her part and just looks miserable through out the entire film. The biggest casting violation is James Franco who comes across as sleepy and somewhat creepy as the main character Oscar (Oz). He overacts in some parts and under acts in others and is with out a doubt the weakest member of the cast.While there is a lot to admire with this film, the problems it has (Mainly the story and the miscasting of Kunis and Franco) keep it from achieving a better grade from me.B-"
1277,tt1222816,1,"I saw this film earlier today when I could find nothing else worthy to watch. It was on NETFLIX of all places. I thought it may be educational, so I turned it on.The camera-work was amazing as were the sights and sounds. Beautiful colors and landscapes backdrop the world of flowers and how they are pollinated across the world, from deserts to lush grassy areas. One of the best documentary films I have ever had the chance to see, and I have seen all of the Disney True-Life Adventure films of the 1950s and 60s.The directing was wonderful, however, the narration could have used some work. Rated 10/10 because it is a beautiful film."
1278,tt1222816,6,"*Advanced Warning!* - I strongly recommend that you watch this DisneyNature documentary without the truly irksome ""I-am-a-flower"" narration (spare me!) from veteran, Hollywood actress, Meryl Streep.I suggest that you turn off Streep's droning voice and turn on some of your favourite ambient music and enjoy watching Wings Of Life (WOL, for short) in that much more pleasant mode.With Streep's preposterous narration aside - I guarantee that the images you are about to see in this 80-minute documentary are, without question, a truly fantastic and wonderful feast for the eyes.When it comes to WOL's visuals - It was so clear to see that absolutely no expense was spared to present to the viewer some of the most vivid and astoundingly beautiful imagery imaginable.Believe me, had it not been for Streep's annoying narration, then I would have not hesitated giving WOL a full 8-star rating, no questions asked."
1279,tt1222816,1,"I have heard of Disneynature before but, it was a trailer for ""Chimpanzee"", but back then I thought it was going to be just another documentary about creature's lives, formed into a story. At first when I looked at this documentary, ""wings of life"" my first impression was it was going to be about butterflies, and birds and bees and all those flying pollinators. but I was in for a surprise. That surprise was what got me hooked up, the documentary was literally turned into a story, like a nature ballet and the ""star actors"" are the flowers, inanimate and slightly motionless yet ""given souls"" as though the flowers were talking themselves, whereas the pollinators are more like supporters in the play. Disney has earned credit for that many times (if you still remember ""Flowers and Trees""), turning objects into actors with souls.Even though Disneynature is just a division of the major company, its documentary still carries that surreal magic, its a great movie, I would recommend it to anyone."
1280,tt1222816,5,"On a positive note - Wings of Life is certainly a dazzling, vividly-photographed, nature documentary from Disney Studios. It tells the viewer a story about pollination, which is continually being carried out (by the insects, birds and bats) from all corners of the Earth.If nothing else - This colourful, 80-minute documentary is certainly well-worth a view, solely for its excellent, state-of-the-art photography.But, on the other hand - Wings of Life is also yet another somewhat heavy-handed warning to all of us human Earthlings. It clearly tells one of the short and long-term effects of man's destructive nature. Here we are told quite frankly how man's environmentally-reckless behaviour is seriously affecting the vital importance of pollination which, if not corrected soon, will spell certain disaster for the overall survival of this entire planet.This DVD presentation also lost itself some serious points due to the annoyance factor of Meryl Streep's unwelcome narration."
1281,tt1222816,6,"Strictly from a visual perspective - I was quite impressed with this nature documentary (concerning butterflies, bees, hummingbirds, bats, and flowers) from Disney Productions.Yes. ""Wings of Life's"" frequent use of awe-inspiring high-speed filming techniques certainly succeeded in holding my rapt attention throughout this colorful and educational 80-minute presentation.But, on the down side - Unfortunately, ""Wings of Life"" was seriously marred by its dreary and downright demented ""I-Am-A-Flower"" narration that was lifelessly recited by veteran Hollywood actress, Meryl Streep........ Like - ""WTF!!??"""
1282,tt1453405,8,"I adored Monsters Inc, it was one of those surprise movies you go into with no expectations and are blown away by. It took years for me to get round to this due to my endless watchlist but I'm so happy I can say that it's worth of the the franchise.Charming, well written, full of laugh out loud moments and undeniably loyal to the original movie with tie-ins around every corner.I especially liked Helen Mirrens character, part monster, part bat, part centipede? I like centipedes, I wanted to be an entomologist once upon a time, obsessed over bugs, learnt all about them then learnt about these things called university, qualifications and effort and thought against it. I'll leave entomology to those with motivation, you enjoy your bugs and I'll enjoy women, movies, video games and various other fun stuff.I digress, Monsters University is a sweet heartfelt movie and makes me hope they make a final part to make a monsters trilogy. Maybe touching upon certain events that happened in this as opposed to it's sequel.Sadly I don't see this happening, I think we have more likelihood of a Princess Bride 2, Brave 2 or a movie where Zac Efron doesn't play an arrogant douche who likes to take his shirt off."
1283,tt1453405,8,"The cruddy trailer hardly filled me with hope for this belated prequel to Monsters, Inc., and the relatively laugh-free first thirty minutes did little to change my mind; however, once Mike and Sully and their Oozma Kappa fraternity brothers enter the Scare Games, the film really picks up and the laughs start to come thick and fast. By the time the end credits were rolling, Monsters University had given me lots of giggles and even a few genuine belly laughs and I'd completely altered my opinion: the oft-used 'under-dogs do good' plot may not be as fresh as the original, but overall I reckon the film is well worth watching.Some of the best moments are clever one-liners and subtle fleeting visual gags which could go unseen, or over the head of younger viewers, but that gives the film repeat value; I hope to catch even more funny stuff the second time around after I proudly add the DVD to my Pixar collection.A very respectable 8/10 (If there had been more funny moments in the first half-an-hour or so, this would have been right up there with Pixar's finest)."
1284,tt1453405,9,"The first Monsters Inc. came out when i was just 7 years old and immediately became one of my all time favourites from the day I saw it. With extremely high expectations in mind and excitement especially for Pixar's close attention to relevance (as I am actually at university now myself) I went to see the new one as soon as it came out.The film is a prequel following closely to our much loved earlier Characters, Mike and later Sully as they present to us their lives prior to the first movie. As well as an adorable new cast of monsters which are equally lovable as the old ones.To my delight, the film exceeded most if not all my earlier expectations. The plot is well written, funny and most of all extremely heart warming especially to long time fans like myself as well as those younger viewers that might not have even seen the first one.The nostalgic element of the film is perhaps the most well written. Every twist and turn reveals a huge or tiny explanation to the events and habits of the characters that I previously saw in the first film. Questions I never even asked myself, like why Randall's eyes are so squinty or how Sully and Randall's rivalry originated. Although i absolutely loved the movie, perhaps its because I've waited for 12 years but at some points it left me slightly unsatisfied and I'd have loved for some parts to be explained more thoroughly. Regardless of my only criticism, the movie made me laugh, cried with tears of joy, almost actually cried and was both heart warming and action packed. What more could you ask for? I urge those fans of the first film as well as anyone that just wants to have a good time at the cinema to see it. It'll be well worth your time!"
1285,tt1453405,8,"Of all the Pixar movies Monsters Inc. has always been my absolute favorite. The incredible story of the remarkable friendship between Sully, Mike and Boo made me watch the movie more than 10-15 times already. When it was released on blu-ray I was the first one to buy it. So when Pixar announced another Monsters movie I got concerned. How could Pixar make a better movie than the original? Or even one that equalled it? But having seen the movie last week I can ensure you all: Pixar is back on top. Monsters University is great fun and it's Pixar best since Up!.Monsters University, a prequel to Monsters Inc., begins with a young and very little Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal) still in primary school. After a field trip to Monsters Inc. he has only one dream: to become a scarer. Years later he arrives at Monsters University but soon learns he still has a long way to go. His main problem? Mike isn't scary at all. He befriends his roommate young Randall (Steve Buscemi), who at that time is an unimportant loser (and later gets seduced by the dark side). The first night he makes an enemy out of Sully (John Goodman), a freshman who thinks that his family name (of legendary scarers) is enough to get him through school. A personal vendetta is born.Things go wrong when Mike and Sully accidentally destroy a sacred item that belongs to the devilish Dean Hardscrabble (a brilliant Helen Mirren). They get expelled from all Scare Classes and will not graduate as a real Scarer. Luckily Mike comes up with a plan, a bet with the dean. If he finds a team to compete in the Scare Games and if he indeed wins, he's allowed to follow the Scare Classes until the end. Dean Hardscrabble approves. Now it's up to Mike, Sully and his team of losers to work as a team and go the distanceIn Monsters University the Scare Games are very well done. I can see both kids and adults laughing their socks off when Mike and Sully, in the same team but still enemies, are doing their first race and try not to step on the items that make their body grow. Bizarre, but hilarious! Their next assignment, when they have to steal something in the library, is also a winner. But what really works in Monsters University is that the story is mainly about friendship. We not only see how Mike and Sully turn from big enemies into big friends; they become soul mates for life. To join the Scare Games Mike must find five extra members to form a team and the only ones left are a bunch of nerds that no one pays attention to and a big blue monster that he absolutely hates (Sully). Still Mike succeeds in making it work. Even when you know that Mike and Sully will win the Scare Games (that isn't a spoiler, is it?), this film isn't predictable at all. It doesn't end with Sully holding up the Scare cup but it takes one more great scene to bring Mike and Sully definitely together. I will not spoil it for you, but it involves a door to the human world and a little green monster that's depressed. Monsters University is a great film. It's both funny and sentimental in all the right places. Fans of the first movie will see a lot of cameos in this one (Yeti!). The story ends when Monsters Inc. begins. I will even advise the next generation to see Monsters University first and then go on to Monsters Inc.Yeah, my faith in Pixar is restored. Although I must confess that with Planes coming up, things can change very fast in the wrong direction. But maybe that's because I have never liked the Cars movie.9/10"
1286,tt1453405,8,"When Mike Wazowski is young, he visits the Monsters University in a tour of his primary school. A senior student gives his hat to Mike and he plans to become a scary monster.Years later, Mike joins the Monsters University and on the arrival, he receives a flier of the Scare Games that will take place soon in the campus. Mike also befriends his roommate Randall. When the lazy student James P. ""Sully"" Sullivan, who belongs to a family of famous ""scarers"", breaks in his room, they start a competition in class. Their dispute ends when they accidentally break the pride and of joy of Dean Abigail Hardscrabble, a cylinder with her greatest achievement – a powerful scream of a boy. They both are expelled from the scare classes by Hardscrambble that tells that Sully is lazy and Mike is not scary, and they become enemies. When Mike recalls the Scare Games, he sees his only chance to return to the scare course. He makes the application to participate, but he learns that he needs a fraternity. Mike joins the Oozma Kappa that is the only fraternity available with four losers, but he is informed that the fraternity needs to have six members. Sully offers to complete the team and Mike has no other alternative but accept Sully in his team. Then he bets with Hardscrambble that if he wins the games, she will accept them in the scare classes. Soon the game begins...""Monsters University"" is a pleasant story of friendship and a prequel of ""Monsters Inc."". The plot is based on the American college life and despite the lack of any identification with my country, with fraternities and silly parties of American college students, the plot is funny and entertaining. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Universidade Monstros"" (""Monsters University"")"
1287,tt1453405,8,""" Monsters University"" is a new film from Pixar that is a prequel to their film ""Monsters Inc."". In addition to the two main characters, a whole lot of new characters are introduced at the college that Mike and Sully attended. The plot involves Mike trying to become a 'scaring major'—something quite unthinkable since he isn't the least bit scary. There's a lot more to the film than this, but I won't spoil it by saying more about the plot.My daughter was lucky enough to go to the debut of ""Monsters University"". She liked it but also felt the story was disappointing since it lacked original characters and the story reminded her of too many college films (like ""Revenge of the Nerds"" and ""Animal House""). My wife saw it with me and she said that the film put her to sleep! This is all very odd, as I am usually the most difficult to please in the family when it comes to films—yet I thoroughly enjoyed the film and nearly gave it a 9. While I would agree it lacks originality, it did make me smile. It was a nice, gentle film—one that I didn't mind just watching without picking it apart (like I usually do). Much of this is because the CGI was simply gorgeous and It was a pleasure watching such a beautiful filmas well as such a nice and enjoyable film."
1288,tt1453405,8,"Monsters University is the prequel to Monsters inc., a wildly popular animation by Pixar. It's basically a college movie set in the monster world, but with a nice deviation from the standard.The good. Still the same incredibly interesting world with all its colors, fantastic creatures, and quirks. Interesting story, especially for the twist. Great animation, as usual. Easily enjoyable by adults. Perfect ending. Excellent voice acting.The bad. Lots of college movie, underdogs, and jocks versus nerds clichés.The ugly. Nothing.The result. If you liked the first one, you'll like this one too."
1289,tt1453405,9,"When I first heard about this and saw trailers, I felt like it would be OK, a good laugh but not enough to really challenge other Pixar films. I can safely say that I was wrong on that score, for it manages to not only be successful prequel to the original film but also a great film in its own right. Billy Crystal and John Goodman slip effortlessly back into their roles as Mike Wazowski and Sully despite playing younger versions of themselves. The other main highlight of the voice cast is Helen Mirren's intimidating Dean Hardscrabble, who is a menacing presence and I'm sure the design of her character was modelled on Maleficent from Sleeping Beauty. Steve Buscemi's Randall also returns and although I felt that he would have a stronger part in the movie, the seeds are sown for his villainous ways in the original.What astounded me was the creativity throughout the film, the effort that had gone into the university environment and the monsters that inhabited it (there's one monster who has university down pat in a hilarious moment that all students will understand!). The new characters that become Mike and Sully's friends, the Oozma Kappa gang, are all adorable and memorable, providing a lot of the film's humour as well as one of its most touching moments towards the end. The film is consistently hilarious but also remembers that it has to develop the initial rivalry then friendship of Mike and Sulley. The world set up in the original is also included more than I thought it would (a couple of trips to Monsters Inc. itself) and there are some brilliant cameos from two memorable characters from Inc.Although the friend I was watching it with said that the film was low stakes, as you knew how it would end, I found that the film still managed to feel fresh despite dealing with underdog clichés and the problem of being a prequel. In a Q and A after the preview screening, the director and producer said that this was about when your dreams don't come true: a strangely anti-Disney philosophy in many ways but one that is honest and teaches kids reality about the world of work, none more so than a delightful montage of pictures explaining how Mike and Sully ended up in their respective positions in Inc. I haven't seen Cars 2 (not sure I want to) and although I enjoyed Brave, it is definitely lesser Pixar fare whereas Monsters University sees them back at the top, creating a touching and hilarious story that will hopefully see them get back to dishing out the quality every time.I am a bit confused as to some of the critical reviews, and why this film currently has 75% on Rotten Tomatoes is beyond me. I sincerely hope this will go up, because it should be nearer 90. I watched Finding Nemo in 3D in April and although Nemo isn't my favourite Pixar, MU is easily as good as that. One critic argues that this film is too similar to The Internship...well that's the Internship's problem, as this film will have been longer in the making undoubtedly and judging from IMDb score doesn't seem to have anywhere near the same creativity and imagination behind it. This may not scale the heights of the Toy Story trilogy but it most certainly is not forgettable and the fact that I nearly shed a tear at one point (and it was NOT for the main two characters funnily enough) proves that the film gives more than just 'how did Sulley and Mike become friends'. If everyone keeps expecting Pixar to produce a Toy Story every time and if they leave a film having not experienced that and express their disappointment/outrage as a result, that's unfair. My favourite Pixars are Toy Story 1-3, Monsters Inc and Wall-E (10/10), then Incredibles, Up, Finding Nemo, Bug's Life (9/10) and I would place Monsters University just after A Bug's Life but in many ways it's probably better.9/10 (RT had better follow suit)"
1290,tt1453405,8,"One of the more understated strings in the bow of animation giant Pixar are the moral lessons that their films provide to audiences. In 2001 Monsters, Inc. introduced us to Mike and Sully, two monsters that were part of a corporation where monsters could travel through teleportation doors and into bedrooms of children to scare them so that their screams would power their operations. Children were also seen as dangerous outsiders until the business learnt that laughter is a more successful for increasing production. Overcoming our fears, risk taking and laughter are lessons that the animation studio itself taught us and embraced on its own. Pixar have again upheld this optimistic, moral outlook because Monsters University is a celebration of diversity and learning your specialist skills. The film is a prequel to the 2001 film, with Billy Crystal and John Goodman reprising their roles as monsters Mike and Sully, who are not friends but college rivals learning the trade of scaring and hoping to be accepted into the Monsters, Inc. The film will give parents an opportunity to talk to their children about the subject of college in a positive outlook. In American there has rarely been a more important time to have this conversation. The Huffington Post wrote in April that there had already been thirteen college shootings this year. In 2007 thirty-two people were shot dead at Virginia Tech. Though never short of funding, the American education system also still produces consistently subpar performances. Countering these pillars of fear and tension, Monsters University captures the emotions of college life and then gleefully subverts them. The core of the film is the friendship of Mike and Sulley, who represent contrasting attitudes in college study life. Mike is hardworking, ambitious and by the book but also small, an outcast and a loner. He wants to be the sole leader. Sulley is unprepared, lazy and coasts off his family name as a Sullivan. He's bigger, more intimidating and popular than Mike and expects everything will come through his natural ability and that he doesn't need to study. After making a bet with Dean Hardscrabble (Helen Mirren), they're thrown together into a Scare Games contest, where they reluctantly band together, along with other loners, to complete a series of challenges to stay enrolled in the college. Each game played against the other rival fraternity houses gives the film a story structure that is not dissimilar to The Internship. Unlike that film though, you actually care dearly about the characters. This is one of Pixar's greatest strengthens, not just as animators but as filmmakers. Each of the hilarious characters, including a middle-aged student and a two-headed dancer, helps to understand each other's strengths and how to use these in the tasks. It could be viewed as a generic 'be yourself' message but in the context of a college setting its thematically sensible because college should be a place where people learn their own skills and can take unexpected detours and still succeed. For those assuming this is a derivative underdog story, there is a huge point of conflict in this film, coupled with Pixar's trademark lump in the throat moments, as the story shifts into its darker unexpected final act. The director of the film was Dan Scanlon, who worked as a storyboard artist for Pixar on Cars. He graduated from Columbus College of Art and Design with a Bachelor of Fine Arts and in his first Pixar film as director he has used these visual skills exceptionally. The film is hysterically funny, partly due to the wit but also the number of sight gags on display. Monsters University itself resembles a proper college, with lecture rooms, dorms and orientation stalls, and uses this detail to reference old college films and campus stereotypes. I liked the variety in the monster designs, like how one of the students had a moustache shaped like a vampire bat or the Gothic monster that had spikes coming out of the microphone she was holding. Dan Scanlon also controls the beats of the story so that there are breathing spaces between the challenges and that action sequences are brisk and never overlong. Hollywood films now are bigger and louder, but with little to say. Monsters University is a rare blockbuster that could teach audiences something. The film is about learning to accept fear and failure, while remaining hopeful about change and growth through our different skills. Pixar's personal talent is that their films are still as simulating as they are funny and creative."
1291,tt1453405,1,"With Animation industries overproducing computer-animated films for either sequels or prequels, expectations from critiques and longtime cartoon lovers who grew up with classic Disney movies are pretty high. For this reason, It has been a while since I get to be surrounded by parents who like to bring their kids to let them enjoy bright and comical scenes. After coming to the theater with low excitement, not only does this movie exceed my expectation but it also proves that Pixar is not a sort of company that tries to take audience's wherewithal by making a mediocre prequel based on the reputation of an original one. As usual, Pixar consistently unleashes intriguing, unique, and appealing characters with flexible movements and simplified traits that attract a wide range of audiences. Especially when it comes to presenting different breeds of monsters with extraordinary looks and abilities, followed by an absolute storytelling skill that moves everyone's emotion. As the setting takes place in the old days before Mike and Sullivan get to work together in Monsters, inc., you get to find out how they meet and grow their friendship. The story consists of both internal and external conflicts that college students can unanimously relate to. Pixar does an amazing job on capitalizing as much college-related elements as possible to emphasize the importance of corroborations, personal identity, and working hard to achieve your goal. There are also tons of humors that make you laugh periodically. In a nutshell, this is a sincere and endeavored film that sends us various messages to help us progress in many different ways. I strongly recommend this to all the students out there who are struggling with their school life. It is such an inspirational movie and Pixar still rocks!"
1292,tt1210819,8,"You know the plot; you also know who is in this movie so lets get to it. Gore Verbinski has delivered a film that moves leisurely along peppered with rousing action sequences, comedy, villainy and pathos. It is solid entertainment. I would place this movie alongside Waterworld, The Last Action Hero, and John Carter as unfairly panned films which deserves to succeed in the cinema halls.It is too bad that there appears to be a hate on for this movie simply because it seems that a lot of money was spent in its making. But look at it this way, when you hire real stunt persons, construct and destroy real trains and stage many stunts for real, it is not going to be cheap. I would rather support this type of movie-making any day instead of the tired CGI based effects laden yawners. Every penny of the budget is on screen in a beautiful shot and staged movie. I found it to be an enjoyable 159 minutes of entertainment."
1293,tt1210819,9,"The early signs were not good, tales of production problems galore and early critical notices wading in to kick the film before it had even had a run at the theatres. The Lone Ranger seemed destined to be a blockbuster stinker. Yet in spite of it noticeably alienating original Lone Ranger purists, and some Western lovers as well, for a rollicking action fun packed time then Gore Verbinski's movie delivers in spades. It's awash with the serial silliness of adventure films and TV shows of yore, pitching good guys against bad guys with buddy buddy shenanigans pulsing away at the core. The stunts are outrageously enjoyable, the landscape photography as beautiful as it is respectful in homage to past masters of the Western genre, while in Depp's Tonto there's a bona fide hero to root for just as much as he makes you laugh out loud. This is an origin story, a tale of how John Reid (Armie Hammer) became The Lone Ranger, and of course how the noble steed Silver and Indian side-kick Tonto became integral to his villain fighting ways. Tom Wilkinson and William Fitchner file in for polar opposite villain duties, the former is the weasel business man trying to mould the West in is own image, the latter a repugnant psychopath with a penchant for eating human hearts! Then Helena Bonham Carter wanders in from some Grindhouse movie for a couple of cameos that are resplendent with sexual energy. It's all very wacky and wild, and rightly so, but this is not at the expense of very good story telling. Some parts of the narrative could have been trimmed, but as the bromance builds between our two heroes, and Silver gets up to all sorts of comedy horse escapades, there's nary a dull moment here. Producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Verbinski throw all the action staples into the pot. Chases, fights, swinging from ropes, shoot-outs, people dangling from speeding train (pic is bookended by awesome train sequences), grisly deaths and on it goes from start to end. There's caustic asides to the machinations of organisations of the time, from railroad magnates to the cavalry, while the catchphrases and legends of The Lone Ranger TV series are deftly inserted into the tale. It was interesting to see Depp come out and defend the movie against those damning early critic reviews, it's not something he does, being as he is very much a guy who sees acting as just a job. Bruckheimer, Hammer and Verbinski backed Depp up, stating that some reviews were written before the film had even been released, the big budget and production problems clearly making this a big stinker Not so, it's certainly not flawless, and those seriously into anachronisms are likely to have kittens. But if you haven't seen it yet, if you was put off by the venomous early reviews, then give it a chance, you may just be surprised at just how entertaining it is. It also looks and sounds brilliant on Blu-ray, where repeat viewings even show Hammer to be better than first thought as that masked man. 8.5/10"
1294,tt1210819,9,"I agree with what the other guy said. ""ignore the critics"" that's certainly all. This movie is much better than it's rating makes you believe, what a shame!"
1295,tt1210819,9,"Just got back from seeing it and we were thoroughly entertained. Depp and Hammer were fantastic in their roles and the action was over the top, as expected. Be advised, this film is told from Tonto's point of view based on his recollections of what transpired. This is not an Oscar contender, nor was it ever intended to be, but it is a great popcorn flick. It is violent in certain scenes and may not be suitable for smaller children, but for adults and tweens, it is about right. I did think that the first 10-15 mins or so were a little too slap-sticky for me, but once it gets going, it gets good. To all of the naysayers out there, what did you think you were going to see? It is essentially a western Pirates of the Caribbean, and Depp portrayed his character with the usual humorous persona he always does."
1296,tt1210819,1,"I tend to side with critics often, and usually find they are on target - case in point- Man of Steel - which I had the highest of hopes for, and felt it was mediocre at best. So, I went in to Lone Ranger with low expectations based on reviews I had read from the so called experts. I was a fan of the series as a kid. Was not sure what to expect from this. Well, This is the Lone Ranger movie for the 21st century. It was fantastic. What movie did these critics watch? It set a perfect tone. Depp was terrific. Hammer was pitch perfect - he became grew to be the Lone Ranger. It left me wanting more, and movies rarely do that for me. Spread the word of mouth - we need this movie to have legs so we get a much deserved sequel. Trust me, its GREAT. And my 7 y/o son loved it just as much."
1305,tt0093748,1,"When jittery advertising executive Neal Page (Steve Martin) is trying to go home for Thanksgiving, he gets stuck with boorish shower ring salesman Del Griffith (John Candy). Their experiences over the next two days are some of the funniest moments ever to grace the silver screen. The best parts are the ""pillow"" scene, the car rental scene, and the freeway scene (warning: you may very well laugh yourself to death). But overall, the reason that the movie is so good is because we come to understand why these two men are like they are.I can't do ""Planes, Trains & Automobiles"" justice by trying to describe it. You have to see it to understand how hilarious it is. You won't have a dull moment in it."
1297,tt1210819,9,"It wasn't hard to outdo the preachy contrived plot of the 2003 Ranger movie, but this one took a step beyond to become a mainstay.First, it is an adventure film, a Western adventure. The Lone Ranger is a mystique character, and part of the challenge is that he tries to bring men to justice alive. Same for Superman. If they didn't have this challenge, they would have no conflict whatsoever. It makes for a puzzle.Tonto takes center stage here, but unlike the 2003 disaster, he is a character instead of a symbol of a godlike race. Here, no favorites are played. The most evil ones in this story are a pair of white men, and other white men they enlist, but we aren't given sermons about this.Depp is great as Tonto. The museum scenes are a bit too much for me, but it is good for the kids. The out of sequence bits work, partly because they aren't emphasized too much. Depp, as Tonto, craftily plays this with a subtle humor, and that is just what is needed for this.There is the magic and mystique of the Ranger, but also an explanation given for it, as ""Nature out of balance"". We are dealing with a supernatural chain of events which do allow the Lone Ranger to ride a horse through and on top of railroad cars.Great blend of humor and adventure, and at the same time a crafty blend of Shakespeare and Indiana Jones. This is better than what meets the eye, and what meets the eye is extra special in itself, with plenty of eye candy for men and women."
1298,tt1210819,7,"Is The Lone Ranger a great movie? Not really, but it is relatively entertaining.Is the movie slow in the middle? A little, but not as bad as most critics would have you believe.The Lone Ranger is a bit long and does ask you to be patient at times, something that seems to be lost in the modern video-game world we live in.The strength of the movie lies squarely with Johnny Depp and his portrayal of Tonto. I seriously doubt that any other actor could have pulled it off. Depp deadpans through several one-liners, which gives us much of the movie's humor. In Depp's capable hands, the character of Tonto is both admirable and witty, with a charm all his own.The first part of the movie definitely gets us started with a bang. It does jump around quite a bit in the first few scenes, which seemed a little disjointed at times, but things are tied together well enough as the movie progresses.The middle of the movie is slower, but we are provided with many of the answers as to the back history of the characters, especially with Tonto and the villains. I will agree that the movie could have accomplished the same with five to ten less minutes, but that is certainly not an adequate reason, in itself, to skewer the film.And the last few scenes are the non-stop action sequences that most modern audiences love, although they do almost come off as cartoonish at times.As stated, Depp's performance is the single biggest selling point for this movie. I thought William Fichtner was very good as Butch Cavendish, the film's main villain. Tom Wilkinson, James Badge Dale, Ruth Wilson, and Helena Bonham Carter all lend excellent support.Of the movie's title character, I'm not sure that someone else other than Armie Hammer wouldn't have made a better Lone Ranger. That being said, the interactions and dialog between him and Depp's Tonto are enjoyable and occasionally laugh-out-loud funny. In many ways, this is a buddy movie, albeit with a bit of a twist.Perhaps, one of the main reasons critics dislike the movie is its title. For all intents and purposes, this is really a Tonto movie. It is more his story and told from his point of view. It probably should have properly been called Tonto. But I don't see that as being a bad thing at all.If you take it for what it is, The Lone Ranger is a reasonably entertaining film, with a very strong performance by Depp. And that was enough for me to give it a 7 out of 10."
1299,tt1210819,1,"IGNORE any bad reviews of this movie. Here's another great summer comedy (also see The Heat) but without the R rating so it's a good family movie. I laughed and laughed at this movie. I was thinking it was going to be a serious take on the Lone Ranger (yeah, yeah I know...even with Johnny Depp). But very quickly as the movie progressed I was laughing and having a great time watching these two.Johnny Depp is a master at facial expressions and this type of comedic timing. Sort of like Jack Sparrow but without the flamboyance. I was totally entertained the whole time he was in a scene in this ""long"" movie which went by very fast. The other actors also did a good supporting job with just enough drama to add to this movie rather than distract.The scenery is awesome and the action scenes are beautifully photographed or green screened, CGI'd or real...whatever. I have nothing negative to say about this one...funny, no gratuitous sex, violence or language, imo. Just fun. What a nice break...I do believe I'm going to see it again!"
1300,tt1210819,1,"The Lone Ranger presents a new take on the classic characters the Lone Ranger and Tonto. This film is exactly what a summer movie should be and one fun ride that you most defitenly don't want to miss.The plot is as follows: An American Indian spirit warrior, Tonto recounts the untold tales that transformed John Reid, a man of the law, into a legend of justice. The two unlikely heroes must learn to work together and fight against greed and corruption This film is from the team that brought us Pirates of the Caribbean that includes director Gore Verbinski, producer Jerry Bruckheimer, screenwriters Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio, and composer Hans Zimmer.The film stars Armie Hammer as the Lone Ranger and Johnny Depp as Tonto, these two have great chemistry that really shows, The Lone Ranger also stars Helena Bonham Carter, William Fichtner, and Tom Wilkinson.The Lone Ranger rides strong for several reasons that include direction, cinematography, casting, screenplay, special effects, pacing, acting, and story. Due to these reasons the Lone Ranger can gain a new younger fan base while still appealing to older fans or casual moviegoers.The bottom line is watch this movie and enjoy its incredible action and comedy that will surly rope you in.... And watch out for some throwbacks to the classic show. 10/10: Hi-Ho Silver!"
1301,tt1210819,8,"I saw a screening of this last night with a friend and to be honest I wasn't expecting much. From the previews I had seen, I wasn't going to spend money on this. So Time Warner offers me two free tickets, I invite a friend and we go and watch this. I was presently surprised after watching this. I remember some of the Lone Ranger comics and remember seeing small clips and my dad telling me stories about it but I never actually saw a show. I enjoyed this movie, it reminded me of fun action with the family. The violence wasn't ridiculous where you couldn't bring children to watch it but authentic enough to know not to try it at home. I saw in an interview that Armie did all the stunts and you can tell. His work on making the character honorable, noble and pretty much a decent human being was very well portrayed. Johnny Depp steals the show with his one liners, a few times I just started laughing at the comments he would make. Overall i'd give this movie an 8/10. Well written, excellent character development, you actually care for them and a great job with the actors and the acting. What I really enjoyed about the movie was that the special effects didn't look too fake. Yeah a few scenes you may have been like yeah right in your head but unlike Fast and the Furious 6, the special effects people on this project do a great job keeping it looking realistic. Bring your family to watch this, a great story of an iconic character. Hopefully this is the start to more because I wouldn't mind watching a sequel or two."
1363,tt1698641,5,"The reason I give this a 5 out of 10 is that this movie is a good one for the kids. A movie with a simple lesson to accept the bad days and enjoy every good one. To be more positive. About the movie out of my point of view? Well, not that awesome, but you can't expect a lot of this kind of movies. Steve Carell didn't perform at his best, that is obvious, but that wasn't even necessary. After all, this whole movie was from the point of view of Alexander. Of course they did choose to make it a little childish. I believe the acting was also based on the viewer to be around 5 - 10 years old. Some simple jokes, not a lot of jokes where to use the brain, but more of the eyes."
1307,tt2294629,8,"This is really a lovely, enjoyable cartoon. And it's just that a lovely, enjoyable cartoon. And basically a fairy tale. One that moms and dads can feel happy to take their children too. Let it be that. Is there anything truly remarkable about it? Probably not. Are the songs particularly inventive or that much different from all the countless other Disney movies? No, not really, but they are catchy and pretty and fit the movie. And the ""In Summer"" song with the snow man in summer is pretty cute, if not a little jarringly placed! But, catchy.Having said that, some people on these reviews are taking this way too seriously. Why would you give it one star just because other people liked it enough to give it a 10? Is that too show how much smarter you are than everyone else? It really shows nothing but taking a carton movie too seriously instead of just going with the flow. It's not real. It's not a real story. It's a cartoon fairy tale.I give it an 8. It's not perfect but I enjoyed it."
1308,tt2294629,1,"When people speak of their favorite Disney movies, the big four of the Renaissance and films of the Golden Age of animation are likely to be mentioned. The past decade has seen Disney movies that were hit or miss. Some considered classics, some forgotten and some close to being classics but not there yet. Frozen changes this dynamic and creates a full fledged classic. Frozen IS not just a classic, it is THE Disney classic of the decade. It could position itself up there with the best of them. Disney returns to its roots with a vengeance. The best animated film of the past few years in my opinion. The story is heart melting, filled with the pure feeling and heart that has become a staple with the best Disney movies. It is a moving story that has family at its center. It is unpretentious in what it is trying to portray. The comedy hits right on the mark and the action packed adventure and thrilling journey make this a tale with a little bit of everything in the exact right amounts. It is a daring movie that is laugh out loud at the some moments and stunning and provoking at others. All achieved in balance. A true triumph in story telling that proves exactly what Disney does best and again proving that they are back to producing top quality films. This is an affecting human story, one that is significant. Startling and stunning, beautifully envisioned, emotionally powerful and relevant. Gorgeous visuals, stunning backdrops and intricacies like you have never seen before. The environments, the costumes, the character movements among other things make this film a gigantic step forward. The brilliant voice talents that breath life into this project need to be applauded and then some. The cast consisting of Kristen bell (Veronica Mars) and Idina Menzel(Wicked!)among many others bring winning charm, superior voice acting and magnificent vocals as well as heart to this tale. The sensational wit and humor, the arrays of different personalities, their emotions, their triumphs and falls make them some of the most interesting characters that people can relate to and some of the best i have seen in animation. The cast fully become the characters.The score and music is perfect. The score is grand. The sound, the texture, the harmony, the melody is in a class of its own. Above and beyond anything attempted by the animation studio in the past decade. I would place the songs up there with those of the 90's movies and 2000's Enchanted. A true all round musical triumph. Songs that will be stuck in your mind and you will be humming them and you won't even know it. And some you will be belting out at the top of your lungs because they are that good. Songs that progress the story and an essential part of it.So you have meticulously crafted breath taking animation, an affecting tale of the bond of family, romance, hilarious wit and humor courtesy of the characters especially sweet Olaf and heart stopping adventure. A true fairy tale that i would say could very well be The Little Mermaid or The Beauty and The Beast of this generation. FROZEN has that Disney MAGIC that has been missing for so long and it comes in full force here."
1309,tt2294629,5,"First of all, I strongly disagree with any assertions that Frozen hearkens back to the great Disney films of the late 80s and early 90s. The music is nowhere near that level, and the storytelling is not nearly as sharp. Even suggesting that this is the best *since* The Lion King rings false with me. I have not seen every Disney film of the past twenty years, but offhand I can say that Tangled, Bolt and Meet the Robinsons are all far superior examples well-written stories than Frozen. In my personal opinion, of course.Second of all, Frozen definitely skews towards the younger crowd, with little to none of the sophisticated touches or wittily mature humor that have come to be somewhat more commonplace in recent animated films. This one is aimed at the pre-teen crowd. Not that that is necessarily a bad thing, but it is worth noting.The overall story is an interesting one, but the execution is rather sloppy and the narrative meanders a bit too much. The dialog, in particular, is not a strength. Unlike the best films, in which every line and every scene feels both essential and perfect, Frozen is more of a loose joyride. Again, there is nothing inherently wrong with that approach, but in my personal estimation, it earns lower marks as a storytelling method.The songs are for the most part unremarkable, and some of the musical sequences suffer from not fully committing to dialog or singing. They just feel hastily-choreographed and not fully thought out. And do not even get me started on the troll song. Yikes.Two of the songs, ""Do You Want to Build a Snowman"" and especially ""Let it Go,"" do work very well. The latter ties into what is unquestionably the best scene in the film on every level. It provides the one glimpse of true majesty, the sort of quality that would explain all of the extremely positive ""this is the greatest"" reviews that are being posted by others. Unfortunately, the film descends most of the way back into mediocrity after that scene.On the positive front, however, Frozen offers a fantastic, gorgeous take on the visual elements of winter. Deep blue ice, snowflakes, white mountains contrasting with colored skies. It is an unspeakably lovely display of a subject matter than CGI animation has never (in my experience) turned its energies to before, at least not like this. Of course, it goes without saying that all of the animation in Frozen, characters and landscapes alike, is excellent.For me, Tangled was much more satisfying than Frozen. I applaud Disney for honing their CGI skills, and for finally adapting The Snow Queen to screen. I just wish that they would have spent more time on the script.With films like this one, a distinction needs to be made between loving it for the visceral takeaway (""it was sweet""/""it had a great message""/""it made me feel good"") and looking at it from a critical standpoint. Now, I understand that one needs to just ""forget about being critical"" and enjoy a film - for me, the best films take care of that themselves. It is the ones, like Frozen, that seem like they clearly could have been much better, that get me thinking about just that.This film is a fun one for kids, and great to look at for adults, but it is far short of being great, or a masterpiece. More focus on an truly excellent story, and it might have been."
1310,tt2294629,7,"Currently, ""Frozen"" has a very high IMDb score of 8.1. I was actually surprised by this, as I did enjoy the film but though it had some plot problems that prevented it from being among Disney's best in recent years. Apparently, other folks don't agree with me.The film is supposedly based on Han Christian Andersen's story ""The Snow Queen"", however little of the finished film seems to be related to this story...very little. This isn't really a criticism--I am just trying to clarify the film a bit.The story is about two sisters--one who eventually becomes queen and one who is her younger sister, a princess. However, the Queen, Elsa (Idina Menzel), has a huge problem that is never really explained in the film--she has magical powers to make things frozen as well as to create snow. While this seems great, it's also a dangerous power and one she cannot fully control--and she COULD accidentally kill someone. Once she becomes queen, the power is exposed--and she disappears into the mountains to live life apart from others.The younger sister, Anna (Kristen Bell), decides to do what any responsible lady would do in this situation--abandon her kingdom and give control of it to an almost complete stranger! Why she didn't just send some of her people out to find Elsa is beyond me. Regardless, along the way she meets a guy who is to become an obvious love interest and together they seek out Elsa and try to bring her back to the kingdom. After all, since Elsa's departure, the place has been bathed in perpetual winter! The film is glorious to watch--particularly on the big screen. The CGI is absolutely lovely as are the character designs. However, it's a film that looks great but whose story is less than stellar. Part of it is because the characters sometimes do inexplicable things (mentioned above), part of it is because parts of the plot are missing (such as explaining how everyone LOVED the interim leader yet hated him later--after he'd actually done a good job in regard to the people as well as why everyone suddenly hated the guy from Weaseltown) and part of it is because there were too many distractions when the main thrust SHOULD have been the relationship between the sisters (the reindeer and guys got in the way). Still, it is worth seeing--especially if you don't spend too much time thinking through the plot. Plus, many might enjoy the more Broadway style of the music, as Idina Menzel really pours it on when she sings (as do the rest, though she clearly overshadows them with her magnificent singing)."
1311,tt2294629,3,"Let me start this off by saying that I generally like Disney films, and that this is not some anti-kiddie flick internet geek writing this. Now that I have that out of the way, I would like to tell you how terrible this movie is. First of all, there is only one song that I think was actually good. The first song in the film is a fantastic number about the hardships of winter, with a great track, expert vocals and a grand, sweeping tone. The rest of the songs are not nearly so good, as they are all sung by the protagonists, which is fine the first few times but gets really monotonous by about halfway through. The movie also wasn't especially funny, which is a saving grace in some of Disney's other lackluster releases. The comic relief character was okay (in that he wasn't nearly as annoying as everyone else) but he was only there to provide some moderately executed slapstick comedy, and the only funny spoken line in the movie. While the script is fine for a TV special or maybe the first episode of a Nickelodeon series, it is definitely not right for a high-profile animated film. Let's just say, there are trolls. Singing, incredibly annoying trolls who show up basically just for the hell of it, and then disappear without a trace. And, while there was one character turn which was actually quite well executed, it is wasted almost immediately, because it changes absolutely nothing about the story. No events drastically alter because of it, there's no clever subtext, and the entire thing feels like it was just inserted so the screenwriter could show how clever he was. I mean, the trip to the cinemas wasn't completely pointless. There was a quite funny Mickey Mouse cartoon they played before the picture, and the trailer for the Lego movie looks like it could be worth something. Otherwise, this movie was terrible. Avoid it if you can, unless you have some kids you need to get out of the house. If so, make sure you bring a good book."
1314,tt2140373,9,"Saving Mr Banks tells the story of Walt Disney's battle to get the rights to make Mary Poppins into a movie. I wasn't expecting to like this but was completely blown away. It is beautifully put together, is hilarious in parts and very touching and emotional at other stages, but is not overly sappy or cheesy. There are some outstanding performances here. Emma Thompson plays Mrs Travers beautifully - a cantankerous and stubborn lady, yet you can't dislike her. Tom Hanks does a good job of playing Walt Disney - a tough role for anyone but he seems to suit it, so long as you can get past the terrible fake southern accent which is worse than Dick Van Dyke's attempts at an English accent in Mary Poppins. However the stand-out performance is, surprisingly, delivered by Colin Farrell as Mrs Travers' father. He brings amazing range and emotion to a character that is simultaneously a loving, sweet father and a man caged in by life and personal demons. Go see it for yourself when it comes out at the end of November. I'm looking forward to watching it again."
1315,tt2140373,8,"i attended a pre-screening of ""Saving Mr. Banks"" last night in Dallas. while i had been looking forward to the film, i had my reservations. after all, Johnny Hancock (director) was behind ""The Blind Side,"" which i found much too schmaltzy and watered-down for my taste. also, this was a movie about Walt Disney being produced by his company - so how honest would it be about the story behind the making of the masterpiece ""Mary Poppins""? would it settle for predictable mellow-drama (yes, i meant to spell it that way) and glorify dear Uncle Walt as perfect and demonize Mrs. Travers as a cold, soulless spoilsport? thankfully, the answer to that is a resounding ""no.""while it surely takes artistic license with history, the film as a whole is surprisingly great. there's not a weak moment throughout, not a second where i wasn't entertained and wanting to find out what would come next. this film (rated PG-13) surprises with many of the thematic issues it tackles, including alcoholism, loss - and we even get a brief glimpse of a smoking Mr. Disney (hey, it was the 60s).Emma Thompson has always been a strong performer though her screen time has waned over the last decade and a half, but here she gives a performance that is worthy of awards attention. As Mrs. P.L. Travers, she is an author as protective as her life's work as a mother is for a child and is dealing with demons nearly forgotten. Mr. Hanks too carries his own playing the iconic and visionary Disney at the top of his game, trying to honor a promise to his daughters while also add to his impressive repertoire of cinematic achievements.this is not really a film to take your Poppins-loving tykes to. this is the Disney film for mom and dad to enjoy. ""Saving Mr. Banks"" will probably be remembered as one of the best films of 2013, and for good reason."
1316,tt2281587,8,"Having read a few strangely critical reviews, I felt compelled to add my own for balance. I am not going to compare this to this Muppet movie or that. I already see too many people doing that.Having grown up with the original Muppet Show and seeing every movie and many TV specials, I have seen this bunch put together movies and shows with varying success. The return to the big screen a few years ago was very welcome, and very well done. With this movie, I think they topped that and quite a few others! To me, as a lifelong fan, this easily ranks near the top of the best Muppet movies made.Once I heard the opening number to the movie, I knew I was in for a treat. Every song in this movie was pure Muppet. Jim Henson always had a way of celebrating the best we all have to offer with a twinkle in his eye and a joke or two along the way. That spirit lives on in this movie. Whether it's doo wop, cheesy 70s music, or just a fun musical number, they cover a lot of ground.The plot, as you may already be aware, involves some creative switcharoo, which is played off very well. This leads to a number of interesting scenes on both sides. The movie is paced very well, and does a good job of switching back and forth between story lines. Just as you become reinvested in one, you're switched back to the other. You will most likely see your favorite Muppet at some point, although only a handful have significant parts. I always enjoy the familiar faces in the background scenes.The human/Muppet ratio was back where it should be. Any proper Muppet movie should always star the muppets, with humans being ""around"". This delivered that perfectly, but also picked the perfect co-stars. Ty Burrell is fantastic, and his time with Sam the Eagle is wonderful, and something I had been looking forward to. Of course Tina Fey is great as well. She's Tina Fey!There is a lot of well done will they or won't they at the end. You'll have to see for yourself if they do or if they don't!And finally, while the matinée I went to wasn't hugely attended, there were a number of kids in the audience, and they all seemed to like the movie very much, even clapping at the end. I personally enjoyed this movie quite a bit. I laughed A LOT. It's fun. It's silly. It's somewhat absurd at times, and that's what the Muppets are all about. And of course, they remind you how great it is to stick together with your friends and family. And any movie that can get the seal of approval from kids that includes clapping must be doing something right!"
1317,tt2281587,7,"So, I saw it last night... and as much as I enjoyed it, something seemed missing. For a devoted fan like me, I believe the missing piece was the emotional impact that many of the great Muppet movies have had. Don't get me wrong, MMW was definitely fun, and I highly recommend it to anyone with kids, to keep the legacy alive. There was plenty of in-joke meta humor, sight-gags, visual puns (Christoph Waltz cameos as himself, dancing the Waltz with a bear), like the last one (and so many before that), which I love. There were references to previous movies (including nice plot AND song callbacks to The Muppets Take Manhattan - one of my favorite Muppet movies ever), and characters (Rizzo and Kermit's nephew Robin get a fun moment). And maybe it's just because the first movie of the Muppets reboot was SO damn good, and contained such incredible levels of nostalgia, but for long-time fans like myself, MMW didn't connect with me quite as well.One big missing piece of the puzzle from the last movie, though, is Jason Segel. Even though this was written by Nicholas Stoller, Segel's writing partner in the first movie, the dialogue and the jokes sometimes fell a little flat. Segel's obvious deep-seeded love and fandom of the Muppets showed through in his script, and that same level of love wasn't here. Plus, Segel as Gary in the first movie, just brought a lot of on- screen fun with him. But of course, I understand that the Muppets don't typically have any permanent human counterparts, so if he had just continued writing on this one, I'd have been happy.The songs were cute and fun, but nothing here nearly compares to the last film's soundtrack. Nothing catchy enough to stay in my head, like 'Man or Muppet' or 'Life's a Happy Song' were. No emotional punch like 'Pictures in My Head' was. I'm afraid that Bret McKenzie will not likely be able to continue his streak of Best Song Oscars. One of the more fun musical highlights, though, was Constantine's (the villain - who was just basically Kermit with a mole and ... a frog in his throat *rimshot*) off-handed seduction of Miss Piggy in one of his (THREE!) songs, ""I'll Get You What You Want"".The human co-stars of the movie were Ty Burrell (Modern Family), Tina Fey and Ricky Gervais. All three shine in their scenes, and all seem to be up for all the fun of your typical Muppet movie, but Fey really stood out in her song ""In The Gulag"". She plays an over-the-top stereotypical Russian guard, keeping Kermit under lock and key for being mistaken for Constantine (the World's Most Dangerous Frog!), complete with Kermit, at one point, wearing a ""Hogan's Heroes""-style hat. The rest of the human cameos were really fun, too. Hobo Joe re-cameos in this one, a carryover from the first movie. There's a cute surprise cameo at the end of the movie. The other standout amongst the cameos for me was Danny Trejo, who at one point, late in the film, you realize is playing... Danny Trejo, the Russian gulag prisoner, which I found to be immensely hilarious. A lot of the cameos are 'blink and you'll miss 'em', though. So the movie does have some rewatchability value for me, at some point.The last thing I'll point out here is that there seemed to be a lot of Muppet cameos as well. MANY different older generation Muppets show up as background characters, so it was fun to play 'Spot the Familiar Muppet' throughout the film. My favorite was the Muppet Newsman, who unfortunately, had nothing bad happen to him.So overall, I think the Muppet legacy has a great chance at continuing their legacy, and I think the last movie gained a lot of new young fans of the franchise, who will all enjoy this one immensely (since kids don't really have the same sort of emotional attachment to the Muppets that I might). I enjoyed the movie greatly for what it was, but am slightly disappointed in the movie for what I thought it could be. I look forward to the next movie, and may actually go back and give this one another chance, to see if maybe I misjudged it the first time around. Sometimes Muppet movies are like that... they take a second viewing to really appreciate the more subtle humor elements, catch some of the sight gags you might have missed the first time around, etc.If any of you were planning to go this weekend, please don't be swayed by my review here to convince you otherwise. Go see it! And please come back and tell me how wrong I am. I'd love that, more than anything."
1318,tt2281587,3,"I'm a Muppets fan and really enjoyed the 2011 film, but I am very, very disappointed with Muppets Most Wanted. This film is just an endless string of clichés. Very rarely is it genuinely witty or surprising. The script wrings all of the effect possible out of heist film tropes, caricatures of non-Americans (stuff that probably would have been HILARIOUS if this was 1964) and of course, the Muppet cast wearing their well-worn roles.Easier for me to summarize are the good points. Ty Burrell was born to play a French Interpol detective in a Muppets film. Jemaine Clement from Flight of the Conchords works great as a young-Topol-lookalike Russian. And there are a few random gags here and there that hit home. Oh, and two or maybe three of the songs are either weird or catchy enough to be enjoyable.But that's it. The plot is nothing great. The dialog lacks wit. Most of the songs are simply dialog set to autopilot melodies. The premise feels like it belongs in a decade of the past. ""Kermit identity crisis"" and ""Muppets heist-related film"" have already sort of been done in The Muppets Take Manhattan and The Great Muppet Caper, respectively. Not exact equivalents, but close enough to make Muppets Most Wanted seem like a lesser retread. I'm glad that the Muppets franchise has been re- energized, but like Star Trek, I have a hard time feeling like it's worth it unless they develop better stories for future installments."
1319,tt2281587,9,"Jim Henson's successors have tried for years to re-capture the magic of the original Muppet Movie, The Great Muppet Caper, and Muppets Take Manhattan and have failed to take us to that special land of wonderment.2011's ""The Muppets"" tried hard (maybe too hard) but stumbled out the gate by making us sit through unbearable musical numbers such as Texas Richman's rap and Amy Adams' ""Me Party."" It's plot also focused on a new Muppet, Walter, as well his human brother Jason Segel and his girlfriend Amy Adams rather than center around the original Muppet cast that we love so dear.The creators of Muppets Most Wanted understood these shortcomings and comically pointed them out. I'm not saying that Muppets Most Wanted is as good as the original three, or date say better. But it is as close to Muppet-Greatness as we've been since Jim Henson's passing.The writers found that perfect balance between silly and witty. The plot centered around the beloved original characters, while introducing a hilarious new villain. The musical numbers had that uplifting, old-school feel and never induced cringing.We finally have a post-Henson Muppet Movie that will stand the test of time. Rejoice!"
1364,tt1698641,1,"Loved it and guaranteed that you will too! A family fun, funny and friendly movie - unpredicatable, perfect! enjoy"
1320,tt0408524,3,"Unskilled, belligerent group of young boys on a losing Little League baseball team get an alcoholic coach who eventually cleans up their act--and his own. Any film-buff well acquainted with the 1976 Michael Ritchie film ""The Bad News Bears"" will watch this remake in a perpetual state of deprivation. For every new ingredient added (a kid in a wheelchair, Hooters waitresses on the sidelines, a skateband interlude), there's a classic sequence dropped, funny lines omitted, a bracing sense of importance missing, and uncharismatic, non-plussed child actors who walk through their roles colorlessly. Of course, Billy Bob Thornton is a terrific substitute for Walter Matthau, but Matthau didn't carry the original film all by himself, and Thornton isn't fully in-character anyway (he's just breezing through). The whole early morning feel of Southern California Little League is missing, and the urgency of the original is gone, too (those kids had something riding on these games). Director Richard Linklater obviously was fond of the 1976 version, but he knows the notes without hearing the music; he supplies updated comedic touches without seeing the relevancy, and his tone and narrative are doggedly straightforward (except for the strange opening sequence, which immediately gets the picture off on the wrong foot). A sad botch. *1/2 from ****"
1321,tt0408524,3,"When filmmakers get the idea to remake a classic movie, often it's because he or she feels that something was missing from the original. They feel that, by placing their unique stamp on the new film, they can satisfy unanswered questions, plot points, etc, while maintaining the basic dignity and character of the original.So...based on that theory, Billy Bob Thornton's rationale for the remake of ""The Bad News Bears"" was that the original had too many letters in the title (in a bold and highly daring move reminiscent of Ed Wood at his finest, Thornton decided to drop ""The"", changing it simply to ""Bad News Bears""), not enough swearing...and a kid in a wheelchair. Oh, and he changes enemy Yankee pitcher's last name from ""Turner"" to ""Bullok"" for reasons unbeknownst to anyone but himself. With revolutionary alterations such as these, don't be surprised if you pick up the rental box half a dozen times while watching the movie to make absolutely sure that you have indeed rented the correct film.Basically, the plot can be summed up as ""Bad Santa coaches a group of misfit kids"". Yawn. We've seen this role, this performance, from Billy Bob Thornton one too many times. Thornton wants to bowl us over with the 'shocking' vulgarity of youth, but a trip to ""Hooters"" and Tanner teaching a boy in a wheelchair to curse both turn out to be so lightweight that it is likely that only the Reverend Jerry Falwell would take offense.At best, the casting was marginal, and at worst, the audience is forced to wonder if the director actually auditioned the kids or merely closed his eyes and chanted 'Eenie, Meenie, Mynie, Mo"" while holding a stack of acting resumes. Sammi Kane Kraft (as Amanda) was a great baseball player with limited acting ability, and Timmy Deters was only modestly successful in trying to recreate the role of Tanner Boyle. Tyler Patrick Jones as Timmy Lupus was far and away the most talented of what basically amounted to a mediocre cast of child actors, but he was utterly wasted in this film and was limited to a few one-liners that must have ended up on the cutting room floor from ""Bad Santa"". Naturally, Thornton is no match for the venerable Walter Matthau as Buttermaker. Whereas Matthau was irascible and cantankerous in a lovable 'Grandpa's dipping in the cider again' kind of way, Thornton's version of Buttermaker is creepy enough to make us think of adequate background checks and the stupidity of parents who would willingly leave their children alone with him.Per his film tradition in his post ""Sling Blade"" days, Thornton goes out of his way to remove any heartfelt sentiment from the plot, and thus the friendship between Timmy Lupus and Tanner Boyle never materializes. That adds to what is perhaps the most irritating part of the film: the introduction of a new player (Tony Gentile as Matthew Hooper). It is an unnecessary plot device, possibly added only because the always classy Thornton had some good 'kid in wheelchair' jokes that he was just itching to use, and adds a touch of surrealism to a movie that should be imminently grounded in realism. In fact, Thornton changes one of the most touching moments of the original movie by handing it to Hooper (a character who, let's face it, has no redeeming qualities other than the fact that he's in a wheelchair) in one highly unrealistic scene; he thereby successfully strips even more of the heart away from the original film. Which, judging from Thornton's film-making history, was probably exactly what he intended to do.In short, there are undoubtedly worse remakes out there (""War of the Worlds"" and ""Bewitched"" come to mind), but not many. If you're thinking of renting this film because you're desperate for some true seventies banality, allow me to suggest that you save the money and instead try catching either the rerun of ""Alice"" where Flo says ""Kiss my grits"" for the eighteenth time or the action-packed episode of ""My Three Sons"" where Fred MacMurray lights his pipe. If you choose to rent the film anyway...well, don't say I didn't give you any other viable options."
1322,tt0408524,3,I'm a fan of Billy Bob - but he ain't no Walter Matthau. Every character is just plain flat - with nothing to act off of. You don't really care about anyone in the movie. Linklater is a much better director and you are better off watching any other movie that either he or Billy Bob has made. A waste of money all around in my opinion. Just go and watch the original - you won't regret it. (They won't let me make my comment unless I have 10 lines of text - but I have nothing else to say. Guess I'll just have to keep typing until they let this go through. Opps not enough yet - how about this time. Still not enough - I think this will make it)
1323,tt0408524,7,"I love Billy Bob Thornton in Bad Santa and the Bad News Bears remake to 2005 after a 29 years since the original film. The film has changed to modify today's world where computers rule the world which I said at 10 years old to an skeptical neighbor and where even a handicapped wheelchair-bound boy can play baseball. Thornton plays Buttermaker, the major league baseball player who turns coach rather than get a jail sentence. The mother of one his players is played by the divine Marcia Gay Harden. I think the kid from Bad Santa also has a role as does Greg Kinnear who plays a competitive coach. I love watching the kids learn the sport by killing insects since Buttermaker is an exterminator and they sponsored by a strip club. They start getting better in the beginning. They are lovable losers who face ridicule and humiliation every day at school. Suddenly, they get help with a girl pitcher and a guy who's a rebel."
1324,tt0408524,9,"Bad news first: there are several bad reviews for this movie posted here. Maybe that's because many of them were from people who were in love with the original movie with Walter Matthau. (It is always hard to get over your first love). I have not seen the original and maybe that is one reason why I enjoyed this one so much. Good news: really smart, laugh out loud script and Billy Bob is fabulous here. I thought the kids were well suited for this comedy (Shortly before seeing this movie I saw another kids baseball flick, ""Aunt Mary"", and the kid actors in it were much less effective). Greg Kinnear is always good, ditto Marcia Gay Harden. Fine acting all around. And the baseball scenes are quite well shot. Very funny and touching without at all being saccharin. Richard Linklater is one hell of a fine director (I just saw his ""Last Flag Flying"", and it is brilliant.) I had avoided seeing this for many years , thinking it was a kids movie....Not a kids movie...PG-13."
1325,tt0408524,3,"I just want to know exactly who Mr. Linklater was trying to appeal to in this movie. Not only is the kids' sport genre tired, they are geared primarily for children most of the time. But with Billy Bob Thorton (who I thought was hilarious in ""Bad Santa""), one would guess they are trying to bring in the older audiences.The movie feels like it has split personalities. There is a ton of swearing and adult humor that would definitely NOT appeal to parents of younger children, but many of the jokes just weren't funny to me because they were aimed at the younger children. The movie is not terrible, but its not good either. It is simply a forgettable movie, which is a shame because I think Richard Linklater is a great director and Billy Bob Thorton seems like a natural when it comes to comedic timing."
1326,tt0408524,1,"Along with others who were born in the late Sixties, I felt that seeing the new *Bad News Bears* was somehow mandatory, if only to indulge in the guilty pleasure of nostalgia. We all knew it would suck, didn't we? -- but we had to see it anyway.Let it be said at once that Billy Bob Thornton as Coach Buttermaker is quite a come-down from the immortal Walter Matthau in the same role. Since the script of this new version is quite identical to the original, much of the degradation displayed here must be put at the feet of Thornton, a notorious ad-libber. None of us, young or old, need to be subjected to exclamations such as ""You guys look like the last s--t I took."" Or to hear copious references to Greg Kinnear's family jewels. But whether through the script or through Thornton's egregious improvising, director Richard Linklater reveals a complete lack of control. Evidently, the best that he feels he can do with this material is to allow it to subside deeper into crassness than the original. The whole enterprise becomes a dreary exercise in upping the ante: Matthau's Buttermaker was a pool cleaner; Thornton's Buttermaker is a rat-exterminator . . . in the '76 version, the Bears are sponsored by Chico's Bail Bonds; in the 2005 version, they're sponsored by a strip-club. Get the idea? What had been a gritty, rather incisive look at everyday Americana has become merely an exercise in crudity. This degeneration of standards can legitimately be argued away as the eternal complaint of the old, but the feeling persists that the original *Bad News Bears* was still made for KIDS, despite the more realistic dialog, situations, and characters. (And Matthau was never a scene-stealer; Tatum O'Neal shone just as brightly as he did. And rightly so.) The Little Leaguers in this film are sadly subordinate to the leering Coach -- guess who the intended audience is? (Hint: not kids.)By the way -- speaking of come-downs -- the iconic role of bad-boy Kelly Leak as portrayed by the super-iconic Jackie Earl Haley has been utterly neutered, here. The new Kelly is played by some incipient Calvin Klein model pretending to be a skate-punk. Pee-yew, man. Hey Jackie Earl, wherever you are: your status as the preeminent prepubescent bad-ass is, like, totally safe.1 star out of 10."
1327,tt0408524,2,"If this had been the original, it never would have been remade. Here are my observations of where they went wrong: The original was well acted and believable. The remake was an over the top farce with some of the worst acting I've seen in a major motion picture in along time.In the original, Kelly and Amanda looked 12. In the remake, they looked 17. Watch them walking with the other Bears, they are about a foot taller.The Coach Turner character in the first was clearly defined. He was an over aggressive sports dad pushing his son and team relentlessly, eventually melting down and hitting his son in public. The audience was never given a feel for the new Turner, except that he was somewhat wimpy, but unreal as far as any person anyone has ever met.They removed the scene of Turner hitting his son, then telling his wife that it was because Joey could have killed Engelbert. In reality, Turner was p'd off because his son disobeyed him. In the remake, Turner seems genuinely concerned for Engelbert.There was almost no character development in the remake. When I saw the first, I felt like I knew the major characters. In the remake, we learned very little. For instance, Lupas in the original was a painfully shy kid who would prefer to be left completely unnoticed. In the remake, he was just a weird kid who had trouble catching.The emotion was totally gone. The scene where Joey wouldn't throw the ball to put Engelbert out to get back at his father; the scene where Lupas begs not to be put in and Buttermaker tells him he didn't come into this life to watch from the bench; the scene where Lupas finally catches the ball to get the Bears out of the inning; the scene where Kelly gets thrown out at the plate; I could go on forever.There seem to be strippers in the remake for no apparent reason. The Buttermaker character is supposed to be a sad loner type. To think that Buttermaker is dating strippers take a lot of the sympathy away from him.Ultimately, there was no magic in the second one. And quite frankly no reason to remake this movie. It occurred to me that the producers of the remake didn't quite get the point of the first one. Or they are insulting teenagers by not believing they are smart enough to get it.I thought that changing the sponsor to a strip club was funny. And having the representative who sued the league be a woman was a nice update. Other than that, I see nothing where this movie adds to what I already saw. And I didn't even list half of what was worse about it.If you honestly thought the new version was better, can I ask specifically what you thought was flawed about the original and how the remake did it better?"
1328,tt0408524,7,"Okay, sometimes I go for a mindless film. This movie was pretty mindless but I expected it to be. It was foul mouthed and showed the kids trying to beat the snot out of each other. After ""Bad Santa"", I really didn't expect any less.Someone else commented that there were long pauses left in for laughing. I'm not sure where he lives, but the people in my theater were all laughing their butts off most of the movie. Maybe it's an age difference - this was a mostly 20-something crowd enjoying this film.Under no circumstances would I want my children seeing this film until they're at least 15, though. It IS an adult film and I don't think that kids need another movie to get bad ideas from. An R rating would have suited the film better, especially if it meant raunchier scenes.All in all I enjoyed myself. It's not a film for everyone, that's for sure - but if you enjoyed ""Bad Santa"", you'll probably like this film."
1329,tt0408524,6,"First, let me say that it's been years since I saw the original and not  being a baseball/softball player myself, I couldn't remember a thing  about it. I thought this movie was funny and had some good messages  promoting ""team concepts"", even though it was hidden sometimes under  crude language, sexual innuendo and other subjects not appropriate for  very young children. I am a Billy Bob Thorton fan and I thought he  played the part well and was exactly the guy for the role. You  generally wouldn't expect to see him in a PG-rated movie anyway. I just  want families with young children to keep this in mind when choosing a  film for all to see. A few families walked out after the first few  minutes that contained some language not appropriate for their young  children. The child actors in the movie are great and make the picture  enjoyable to watch. The other benefit to this film, again for the  appropriate aged audience is that it is about two hours long so you  feel like you get your money's worth!"
1330,tt1647668,8,"went to an advanced screening with mom and we were laughing crying and cheering all over ourselves and with the other moviegoers in the theater. i mean, seriously we all clapped and jumped out of our seats. what a treat! the premise is simple: take a self-involved ambitious businessman and stick him with three talented but hungry baseball prospects and they end up changing each other for the better. plus, the cast is superb! Alan Arkin, Bill Paxton and Suraj Sharma, Madhur Mittal who play their real-life counterparts, wow just wow! my family loves sports movies and my mother loves baseball movies in particular, so seeing this with her on mother's day was perfect. if you love baseball movies or know kids who love baseball (or any sports for that matter), Million Dollar Arm is a must-see feel good film. it's The Rookie meets Hoop Dreams.... go see it"
1331,tt1647668,9,"In a spate of recent sports themed movies, all of which were good, I have to say I consider this one the best. Toss together some baseball history, an excellent script, terrific casting, great acting, a bit of the squalor, beauty and toe-tapping music of India and Viola! You end up with a good film. To try and single out one single actor in this film I liked the most or was most impressed with is impossible. Every one was amazing. You don't need to be a baseball fan or even know that much about the game to appreciate this picture. I and my companion (who is about as far from a sports-minded person as you could find) for the viewing were both thrilled with this one. When the people coming out of the opposite door at the end of the picture smile and say, ""Good movie, wasn't it?"" You know you've seen a good movie. There are some I want to see again.this is one."
1332,tt1647668,9,"The Hollywood's exploration of India based subjects is continuing. I have been enjoying those. Something quite refreshing which traveling on a new perspective to entertain the world audience. Especially, this movie was not a bigger one like 'Slumdog Millionaire' or 'Life of Pi', but cute emotional family drama like 'The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel'.It was a biopic-sport-drama about an American sports agent, J. B. Bernstein, who brought two young fastest arm Indians to the States to train as the professional baseball pitchers. Before that, he conducts a reality show called 'Million Dollar Arm' in various Indian locations to find the perfect one. In the end he gets two and takes back them to the country. What follows is the cultural collision where these two finds hard to fit in and perform. With many inspiring lines and tears in our eyes it comes to the conclusion.It was a nice story and inspiring. This movie teaches many things like about family values, sharing culture, hard work for a better future, having faith, true love and all the above the most deserved second chance. It was a predictable story. The minor problem with the movie was it won't explain thoroughly some of the contents it portrays. It is due to cultural different some will have a hard time to figure it out the meaning of it. But for South Asians and Indo-American it will be a perfect movie.The movie had more than sufficient humorous scenes and many of them were in an Indian accent. I had a great time laughing for those comedies. Those comedies are because of the difference pronunciation of the same word between the people of two countries. The character Amit is the center of the attract when it comes to the humour. In the other end, especially in the second half the story drags most of its parts towards the sentiments. I can't say it was unnecessary, but truly was impeccable and touching.''They need to know that you care them''I never knew this director. After checking out his filmography, yeah, I have watched many and liked a couple of his movies, especially 'Lars and the Real Girl'. He did a great job, especially shooting in Indian summer is not an easy task. He himself told in Q&A meet about his struggles. All the actors well cooped. John Hamm's one of the best performances. No doubt he was remarkable.The boys from 'Slumdog Millionaire' and 'Life of Pi' are the two Indian characters. Suraj Sharma as Rinku and Madhur Mittal as Dinesh did justice to the respective roles, though they were not similar kind of face to the real ones like usually filmmakers choose for a biopic. They were really good, did key performances alongside John Hamm's JB character. Lake Bell was a surprised attraction of the movie. I found her kind of cute in some of the scenes than never before. And other major attractions were Alan Akin with his usual incredible show in the small span, and a few others, especially that Indian character called Amit.Even before it was released many had criticised it by saying a TV movie and so 90s. But I had faith in it and watched and it never disappointed me. I have already said in my many reviews that I love tearjerker movies, so it was my perfect one. Some mighty one's are releasing on the same week this movie hitting the screen. I believe this is the only one pure family drama that one could ask for an alternate. In fact best by so far in this summer, according to the family friendly films. I highly recommend it, but all you need is to have a low expectation."
1333,tt1647668,1,"OK, I admit that you could probably predict the course of the movie just from seeing the trailer. However, this movie makes you forget about its predictability. The acting was superb, you really feel for the characters and what they are going through. You want them to succeed and surpass the adversities. With that being said, this movie will make you laugh, cry, and smile. It's just one of those feel good movies. In fact, the entire theatre audibly laughed and cheered on the boys. This is the first time I've ever seen a theatre audience so engaged in a movie. I recommend this movie for everyone. If you're looking for a feel good, charming movie, this is it!"
1334,tt1647668,8,"Based on a true story, Million Dollar Arm is a predictable motivating sport film from the Disney stable.Jon Hamm with his flawlessly groomed stubble and cocky grin plays the haughty sports agent Bernstein with ease. As a groomed smooth talker in sharply tailored corporate suits, there are few to match Hamm and he does what is expected of him. The two main characters of the movie are Suraj Sharma, the star of Life of Pi who plays Rinku and Madhur Mittal, the older brother in Slumdog Millionaire who plays Dinesh. Both of them perform their roles very beguilingly and inspire affection from the crowd. The rest of the supporting cast also perform their roles very well especially Lake Bell who was very impressive in her cameo role as Brenda.I might be a bit biased since I am from India but the comedy in the movie is hilarious...I found myself laughing throughout the movie enjoying every moment of it. The direction and editing are also pretty impressive. In a nutshell, all the elements in the movie combine really well and the result is a fine movie which has plenty to offer.So, overall, Million Dollar Arm is a finely made movie which will impress you despite being predictable and is certainly worth a watch.My Rating : 8.5 out of 10"
1335,tt1647668,1,"First, let me say I LOVE sports movies. Second, it is rare that I give any movie higher than a rating of 8. This movie has it all--and it's not really a ""sports"" movie.To begin with, there is a great story. The characters are well developed and the scenes in India provide just the right background for what these young men must have gone through in their transformation. There was more that one heart-jerking moment without ever being maudlin. I was prepared to give this a lower score because I was sure the love-interest story was contrived just for the movie, but it turns out to be true.Be sure to stay for the credits, which has many ""real-life"" photos as well as more scenes from India, and updates on most of the characters. I was disappointed to see there wasn't a follow-up on Aash who provided the initial inspiration for the concept, but I'm guessing he/that WAS created for movie.While sports movies usually follow a tried-and-true formula, and this one hones pretty close to that formula, it is still refreshing nonetheless and quite enlightening. I was not at all familiar with this story, and am interested in finding out more.And lastly, how refreshing it is to see a good movie (set in professional sports, no less) that has NO obscene language. Other filmmakers, take a look at how successful and enjoyable this movie is without a profanity laced (or drenched) script."
1336,tt1647668,9,"I am a pretty big sports fan. Despite this, though, I can be fairly picky with my sports movies. A few general questions that I always ask. First, why was this movie made? There are a ton of great moments that happen in sports, but not all of them deserve movies to made of them. And along with that, sometimes an ordinary event is glorified in the movie, which causes you to raise an eyebrow when you learn the actual events. Next, how faithful is this to the actual events? Yes, I know this is Hollywood and they are going to change things. But if they change things too much, it can be a problem. For example, if the actual person portrayed in the movie doesn't like what Hollywood did with them, that is a problem. Finally, sports movies can be really cliché and predictable because there are only really two options for the ending -- the team/player succeeds in their goal or the team/player fails, but a lesson is learned. So what else do you bring to the table that will give your movie substance and avoid being just a cliché sports movie? Going into Million Dollar Arm, I was actually really excited because Disney had been raving about this movie for quite some time. I'm happy to report that it passes this test with flying colors. First off, yes this is a movie that deserved to be made. And no, it's not just an ordinary event that was glorified. And while I'm at it, it seems pretty accurate to the actual events. This is a movie about a sports agent named JB Bernstein. He's in a pretty dire situation and needs to make a huge splash or else business-wise he is in a lot of trouble. Using Yao Ming's situation as inspiration, he decides to go on a quest to get the first Major League Baseball player from India. Just like all of China followed Yao Ming's journey in the NBA (he made the all-star team even when he didn't play most of the season because of fan voting in China), an MLB player from India would be equally as huge with how many people live there. With this idea in mind, Bernstein sets up the competition called the Million Dollar Arm, which is essentially a try-out where the top two throwers would get to come to America with the opportunity of trying out for an MLB team.Is this a predictable sports movie? Of course. The events of this movie took place just a few years back and a quick wikipedia search can tell you all about these two players. But the point here isn't to throw a curveball at audiences. The main focus isn't even on telling the world about an extraordinary event that happened less than a decade ago. It's all about relationships. Bernstein is a single man that is all business at first. What he seems to have missed is that he's brought two human beings halfway across the world just to make a successful business move. These two Indian boys are still teenagers that have never been away from home, at least not so far away from home. They are scared, nervous, alone, and don't even know the language at first. This is an emotional roller-coaster for everyone involved and watching it unfold is touching and beautiful.What makes this movie work is the performances from all the actors. It's a grand slam performance. Starting from the top, Jon Hamm plays JB Bernstein and if this movie came out in the fall, I'd say he'd be a good contender for Best Actor at the Oscars. It'd be a deserving nomination. Lake Bell plays the neighbor/love interest for JB. She does a fantastic job as the mediator between JB and the boys, helping JB come down to earth to treat the boys right. Finally, our two Indian players, Rinku and Dinesh are played by Indian actors Suraj Sharma and Madhur Mittal. These two are the stars of the show. From the very beginning, you become emotionally invested in them and their journey. You want them succeed. You cheer for them when they perform well. You are devastated when they slip up. You scream inside at Jon Hamm when he treats them poorly. You fall in love with Lake Bell when she takes them in. Sharma and Mittal are fairly new in the acted business; however, they are not unrecognizable. Sharma plays the lead role of Pi Patel in Life of Pi and Mittal shows up in Slumdog Millionaire. There's also other great performances in this movie from the likes of Aasif Mandvi, Alan Arkin, Bill Paxton and Tzi Ma, but this will suffice.Overall, Million Dollar Arm is a movie that is a must see in my opinion. Yes, there are a ton of huge summer blockbusters in the next month or two that will all fight for your attention, but don't let this movie slip past you. If for some reason you find yourself tired of all the huge blockbusters, then this is definitely a movie that you should check out, because it will be a breath of fresh air. Even if you are not a sports fan, I think this is a movie that you will love, because like I said, it's all about the relationships in the movie as opposed to the historical sporting event that is portrayed. If this movie were to come out at the end of the year, I would think it would be the type of movie that contends for an Oscar nomination or two. It's that good. It will certainly join the ranks of all the great sports movies. My grade for Million Dollar Arm is a 9/10.For more reviews like this, go to drogemiester.blogspot.com"
1337,tt1647668,1,"Regardless of how people say the film was a Disney Film, predictable, etc, unaware of this true story, all I can say is that I thoroughly enjoyed the film. Being an Indian student in America, the film connected me to my culture in India. The background music, the sentiment, and the portrayal of Indian traditions made me feel nostalgic of how I miss my home back in India. All I can say is that watching this movie made me feel like I was in India enjoying this experience with Rinku and Dinesh! The music was excellent. AR Rahman killing it as usual! Suraj Sharma has a bright acting future and Amit looked very cute. Excellent film! Go India!"
1338,tt1647668,6,"In terms of content, it's hard not to like MILLION DOLLAR ARM. There's a winning performance from Jon Hamm as the harassed agent trying his best to re-establish himself, while discovering the importance of looking after his charges; complemented by Lake Bell as the next- door neighbor, the intern who understands more about the young Indian boys' predicament of inhabiting a completely alien culture. As the two boys, Suraj Sharma and Madhur Mittal are particularly good at communicating - often through nonverbal means - their sheer bewilderment once they are transplanted from their rural Indian surroundings to metropolitan Los Angeles. Although they eventually make a success of their quest to become major league baseball pitchers, they nonetheless find it difficult to adapt to alien surroundings.And yet there is a strong sense in which Craig Gillespie's film serves to perpetuate rather than negotiate stereotypes about the Indian nation and its people, and the Americans' responses to it. Hamm's JB is predictably confused by the disorganized ways in which the Indian people do business, especially in his interactions with Vivek (Darshan Jariwala). By implication, therefore, the American (i.e. efficient) ways, are naturally superior. Meanwhile aging coach Ray (Alan Arkin) rejects the Indian way of life altogether, as he complains about the prospect of contracting the so-called ""Delhi belly"" (an upset stomach), and returns to America on the first available flight.Once the Indian boys are transplanted to the United States, they are frequently used as butts for cheap jokes; there is one scene in a hotel, where they experience problems with the elevator, which is particularly orientalist in tone. The film seems not to be aware of contemporary realities; in economic terms India is no longer a backward country but gradually becoming an economic superpower in its own right. Nonetheless the film does make an effort to recognize the strengths of Indian cultures; the emphasis on family stability and the ability to converse contrasts starkly with JB's life, in which he is so busy that he has little time either to consider marriage or even to talk to anyone at length. The Indian characters also take time for daily prayers; the contemplative life is as significant as the active life in human beings. Perhaps the western world has become too secular to understand this.MILLION DOLLAR ARM is an ambivalent piece, at once celebratory of yet still reluctant to recognize the strength of contemporary Indian cultures. Yet it's still worth a look."
1339,tt1647668,6,"JB Bernstein (Jon Hamm) is a sports agent, venturing out on his own to start his own sports management agency, with his partner Aash (Aasif Mandvi). He has represented stars like Emmitt Smith and Barry Sanders, but they have long since retired. JB is looking to sign a lineman named Popo (Ray Maualuga) but Popo signs with another agent, so JB is left with no clients, and no prospects. While watching a cricket match and Britain's Got Talent, JB hatches an idea to sign an Indian baseball player, and turn it into a reality contest, called Million Dollar Arm. After finding a crotchety, old, retired baseball scout named Ray, (Alan Arkin) JB heads to India to find his prospects. He and Ray find 20 prospects, and whittle it down to two, Rinku (Suraj Sharma) and Dinesh (Maddhur Mittal) and a translator named Amit (Pitobash) who dreams of being a baseball coach. Together, the four go back to Los Angeles, where pitching coach Tom House (Bill Paxton agrees to work with Rinku and Dinesh, and they have a year to get a tryout, or the deal with their financier, Chang (Tzi Ma) falls through. Do Rinku and Dinesh succeed? Is JB more interested in the deal or in Rinku or Dinesh as people?Disney is marketing this movie as a cross between Slumdog Millionaire and Jerry Maguire. It is very much like Jerry Maguire, but it's more like The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, because the Brits are openly contemptuous of India and Indians much like JB is, but gradually a transformation occurs and the Brits in Marigold Hotel learn to love the country and its customs. Does the same transformation happen here? Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't. But let me say this Marigold Hotel is a much better movie, a much more deep and profound movie. Maybe Million Dollar Arm is neither deep nor profound, but it is entertaining. There are laughs to be had here, and it's a different kind of baseball movie. It's fun to see two people who've never thrown a baseball before pick up a vital aspect of the game in such a short time. If you don't like baseball, this movie won't hold much entertainment for you, and while it's not Field of Dreams or Bull Durham, it is fun.There's a lot of culture clash/fish out of water humor, both with Hamm's character and the Indian boys. I don't particularly enjoy fish out of water humor, and it doesn't particularly work here, but the movie works because of the acting, and not so much the script. Is it an entertaining movie? Yes it is. Is it worth going to the movies to see? No it's not. But it is worth the price of a rental.Jon Hamm is good, he doesn't stray too far from his Don Draper character, believe it or not. He plays JB as a superficial womanizer who only dates models. He plays a ""Grade A Jerk"" in the words of this movie, and if I was JB Bernstein, I wouldn't be too flattered by this portrayal. Lake Bell plays a woman who rents a room from Hamm's character and serves as some comedy relief and eventually a love interest, but the love story is clunky. Lake Bell reminds me of Amanda Peet, a pretty girl who's trying too hard to be funny. Alan Arkin plays a crusty old curmudgeon again. He seems to have found a niche. Asif Mandvi is less funny than I thought he'd be, and therefore disappointing. The best actors in the film are the Indian actors, Suraj Sharma, Madhur Mittal and Pitobash as the translator. Their natural performances add a lot of depth and emotional weight to the film. The boys are away from home, they miss their families, but they have a once in a lifetime chance. Their performances are complex in ways I didn't expect. And Pitobash shows sincerity in this performance, he really wants to learn about baseball. He has a dream too, and he's realizing it through his countrymen. Bill Paxton does an excellent job as pitching coach Tom House. He doesn't want this to be a publicity stunt, he wants this to work for everyone involved. Paxton plays House with a no-nonsense intensity, which is refreshing.Finally here's a non-animated film that you can watch with your family, and it's worth seeing. Was Disney doing a little marketing themselves? Selling this movie to the growing Indian community in the US and a huge international audience in India? I didn't see many Indian people in the audience at my theater, but it made 10 million dollars in it's first week, not bad for a film going up against Godzilla.For more hardball reviews, visit my blog, reviewswithatude.wordpress.com"
1340,tt1587310,1,This movie is brilliant ans deserves a way higher rating than it has. The whole character of Maleficent is so intresting and the twist of the original story is really good.
1341,tt1587310,9,"IGNORE THE TRAILER: GO SEE IT!I saw this movie tonight with a friend and it was spectacular. Going in, I was excited as a life-long Disney fan but also expecting a somewhat cheesy good-vs-evil type of movie based on what I had seen in the trailer. I couldn't have been more wrong! Angelina Jolie delivers an amazing performance and makes a well-known, previously rather one- dimensional Disney villain relate-able and more sympathetic, while also managing to look like a convincing, gorgeous, magical creature.The CGI is a tad heavy and a little freaky at times (such as the three coloured pixies/Aunts) but was used, in combination with some amazing sets, to create a fantastic world and creatures which were reminiscent of the beautiful and imaginative work in movies such as ""Hellboy 2"" and ""Pan's Labyrinth"". The effort by the art team here really helps to draw you into Maleficent's world at the beginning of the movie and makes you wish you were a kid growing up with this movie as fodder for your imagination.Although Maleficent's character has been humanised in this re-telling, the story really emphasises that she isn't human at all, and explores the ins and outs of her life and how she relates to the humans she encounters.The plot for this movie really fits into the current trend of exploring the anti-hero (Breaking Bad, Hannibal...) and shows that Disney is trying to break with its past depiction of characters being black and white, good or evil, etc.I feel like I am gushing over this film, but as a Disney classic lover I have been truly impressed by what is sure to be a new favourite with kids and adults equally. I do expect some controversy over parts of the film but I won't discuss those here."
1342,tt1587310,1,"This film is a TRUE fairy tale. It's dark. It's raw. And it's written from the dark, raw experience of women. Maleficent is about what happens when your Prince turns into a Frog. It's the personal, inner journey to recover from a physical trauma and emotional betrayal by those who are closest to us and who we trust the most. It's about how to survive that type of horrific evil without becoming evil yourself. It's message is that profound.The critics complaining about this film want ""fairy tales"" to stay in the same ""one-love-fits-all"" mode where people are either good or evil and that all one needs is to find ""romantic"" love and marry a ""good"" Prince or Princess, and you will live ""happily ever after,"" safe from any pain or sorrow. But real life is a lot messier than that.It's actually evidence of how rare it is to see women's unfiltered subjective emotional landscape portrayed on film that it seems many of the critics cannot even wrap their brains around it! No matter. This film is so sensually visually stunning and viscerally emotionally cathartic that sheer word of mouth enthusiasm is going to make this a blockbuster, no matter what the critics say.And it's equally rare to see a protagonist whose inner landscape is more complex than simply extracting revenge, destroying their enemies and...roll credits. People are more complicated than THAT fairy tale we are sold in every other ""action"" and ""adventure"" film that only serves to reinforce the psychopathic values of revenge and bravado.Sometimes a film is so ahead of its time that the critics are behind and so philosophically deep that it's message is incomprehensible to the more superficial among us. This is one such film.Woolverton and Jolie have crafted a masterpiece.Don't miss it."
1343,tt1587310,1,"Every true fan of the original Sleeping Beauty (1959) was skeptical about this and how much it had to deviate from the actual movie, and as more of the movie was revealed, it was only proving to be another female empowerment, victimized villain kind of a movie. But I'm glad I was wrong, for I'm sure only by watching the whole movie can we truly appreciate and understand the very convincing back story and development the character was subject to. Of course with very liberal changes to the original plot, the key elements that you'd look for are intact. Need I mention the perfect casting of Angelina Jolie, Maleficent truly comes to life in full form by Angelina's stunning skills and presence. A twist that's not cliché, sentiments that are deep, humor that's ever so natural and action that always keeps you at the edge of your seat! Maleficent in this movie is not exactly as we know of her from the few minutes we got to see her in the original movie, but let me tell you she's every bit deliciously evil. It was amusing to see Angelina play a role that requires a lot of nuances to pull of this character with a lot of depth as opposed to the one-dimensional character from the movie. Never letting off the grip, she carried the movie on her shoulders. Nothing to take away from the beauty of the rest of the movie which takes breath with excellent direction and visual effects that will truly transport you to another world, and the amazing work by all the 'supporting' actors. Yes, the other characters weren't as fleshed out as Maleficent, but I see that as good thing, given the title and theme. A spectacular balance. I'd also like to bring light on the enchanting score, thanks to James Newton Howard, this maestro is underrated.A comprehensive movie, there's a little something for audiences of all ages, truly a masterpiece."
1344,tt1587310,7,"Review: I really thought that this was going to be a typical Disney movie about fairies and magic dust, but I really enjoyed it. Although the storyline is based around Sleeping Beauty, I found it quite dark with some adult content. The CGI throughout the movie looked impressive and Angelina Jolie played her part extremely well. After being betrayed by her loved one, she turns quite evil and full of hate, but once Aurora comes into the picture, you get to see an inner sweetness which made her character entertaining and a joy to watch. Pieced together with Sharlto Copley playing the villain, this movie really did have every aspect covered and I'm not surprised that it made so much money at the box office. A Great Watch!Round-Up: Angelina Jolie really doesn't make that many movies anymore, but when she comes out of the woodwork, she really does come out with some good movies. From Changeling to the action packed Wanted, she really does have a versatile acting ethic and with all of her charitable work and her hectic family life, I'm not surprised that making movies is low down on her priority list. I liked the chemistry between her character and Sam Riley, who played the crow, and the action scenes were very well thought out by the director. Personally, I don't think that it's a movie for the young ones because there are some scenes that will give them nightmares, but there are some scenes they will enjoy, like her magical land and the amazing creatures. In all, I'm surprised that I enjoyed the movie because I really wasn't expecting something so dark.Budget: $180million Worldwide Gross: $757million (WOW!)I recommend this movie to people who are into there Disney movies which are based on the concept of Cinderella. 7/10"
1345,tt1587310,4,"With the release of movie adaptations of classics like Snow White and Jack and the beanstalk, both of which I was highly entertained and thought it was simply amazing this movie was a sad let down. Pros: Visually stunning. Angelina Jolie's performance was spot on with the most evil of classical villains we always knew. Cons: The most beautiful princess Aurora looks like the girl next door. Why does Hollywood try to do that is beyond me. Mary Jane Watson (Spidermans love interest) is supposed to be a beautiful actress and a model. But again the movie portrays a girl next door look in ultimate Spiderman. Elle Fannig's acting was not strong and in the end not memorable in the least. It felt like she was there for the sake of being there.Sharlto Copley acting left a lot to be desired. Was he supposed to portray a loving farther and husband driven mad or a power hungry king driven insane by his overwhelming need to destroy the one creature that he could not bring himself to kill when he had the chance? If he was supposed to potray caring scenes it never really showed. ______________ ______________The King is portrayed as an evil man who begged for his daughters life and could have easily returned maleficent's wings but instead chose not to for reasons which are beyond anyones understanding. This is the start of where the movie just becomes a drag. Maleficent curses the child to die in the original storyline and this is the most important part in the story because of which the 3rd fairy who did not bestow a gift alters the curse by making them sleep instead of death. This part is totally lost in the movie. Watching a bunch of incompetent fairies nearly almost kill a child before the curse can take effect is as much a mystery as why maleficent would watch over the child and save it. Why the king would entrust his child to faeries whom he dislikes is also as much a mystery as why he would not send a nurse maid to care for his only child. The worst part of the movie is being subjected to watch the Princess grow to 16 years old and marvel at the beautiful fairies (it feels like pointless fillers). Also when the princess realizes whats going on one day before her birthday, the 3 incompetent fairies again forget to mention about what happened to Maleficents wings. The good fairies were not incompetent, just funny in the original story and smart enough to hide away the princess for 16 years. Why they made them look so incompetent and negligent is beyond me.Once you get over the visuals you will realize its nothing more than a chick flick geared at young children (visuals) and adults who are romantically inclined. The most evil Disney villain for over 50 years reduced to nothing more than a scorned women out to seek revenge for the betrayal. A loving father reduced to nothing more than a mad evil greed driven man who plunges himself into insanity with a overwhelming urge to kill maleficent despite his daughter being returned safe and well. Many times during the movie I found myself thinking about what work I have the next day or what needs to be done. This is something I have never experienced when sitting and watching a movie on big screen completely immersed in the plot. This is a far cry from Snow White and the Huntsman which was really good barring Kristen Stewart's emo acting (emotionless) drawn from twilight."
1346,tt1587310,1,"Maleficent is magnificent. The story is sophisticated enough to delight adult audiences with a brilliant take on the beloved tale with a delightful twist including the meaning of true love. The characters are sympathetic and there is enough excitement.The art direction and cinematography are beautiful. The fairy land scenes resemble a pre Raphaelite painting. The castle was a bit generic CGI. The right blend of human faces with CGI so it didn't look too animated. The director Stromberg who did Oz the Great and Powerful did an even better job here.Angelina Jolie's expressive face is the perfect showcase for the character - it is the role of her lifetime. Like the way they did her cheekbones to make it like the Disney cartoon. Sam Riley as her sidekick morphs into many fairy tale creatures crow, dragon horse. The creatures are well done not awkward in movement and not overwhelming. Elle Fanning is sweet and picture perfect for the role of Aurora and Brenton Thwaites plays her prince. The fairies including Juno Temple and Imelda Staunton are cute too.Liked this more than the Snow White movies 'Mirror Mirror' and 'Snow White and the Hunstman'. The first was fun but a bit silly and the second was too grim. Maleficent is the perfect blend of excitement and fairy tale. Most enjoyable film of the year."
1347,tt1587310,1,"I was genuinely excited to hear that Disney was going to make a film about Maleficent, my favorite Disney villain of all time. I was interested in knowing the 'why' behind her actions in Sleeping Beauty, since we never really got to see that. I will say that the cinematography is amazing. I will also say that while Angelina Jolie was not my first choice, she had the look, her costume was spot-on, and there are moments where you can see where she is at least trying to play this role correctly (and really, who could replace Eleanor Audley?). But one thing I've noticed over the past 10-15 years is that animation and design seem to be their main focus, rather than story or character development. In the movie, Maleficent's back story was incredibly rushed. So much for going into depth on why Maleficent is the way she is.This movie does not explain why Maleficent is the way she is. Disney is showing us a completely different character while giving her the same name as Disney's most iconic villain. Now they're trying to say that Maleficent is a misunderstood character who becomes evil. But that never happens. She becomes angry and bitter, but not evil. Maleficent in this movie is not even a misunderstood, sympathetic character. She is a total victim who never becomes evil at all.Oh, she does do one evil thing; she does still curse King Stefan's baby out of revenge. And she has second thoughts about it two seconds afterward. See? Not evil at all. And while I'm at it, I should mention my distaste for the way she cursed Aurora: Disney completely lowered the stakes by having Maleficent utter the words ""sleep-like death"" and be the one to offer the cure of True Love's kiss. No! It's MERRYWEATHER that counters the DEATH curse in order to save Aurora's life! Oh, Maleficent may say later that she doesn't believe True Love exists, but that's a matter of opinion isn't it? Again, LOWERS THE STAKES.And what was Linda Woolverton thinking when she took King Stefan and the three fairies completely out of character and gives them a complete 180 in order to make Maleficent look good? If you're going to show us the point of view of a famous villain, it's okay to give them layers and gray areas in order to make them more interesting and multi- dimensional, even to show they weren't always evil. But NOT to say they were never evil at all; that just completely defeats the point of the character! Same with the good guys; they may have their own flaws, show that they have their own prejudices, or that everything they did wasn't perfect. But NOT to say ""the good guys were really EVIL OR STUPID!""The fairies, Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather (I refuse to call them by their new names) are NOTHING like they were in Sleeping Beauty, and this is a big deal. In Sleeping Beauty, say what you will about their flaws but their ultimate motivation was keeping Aurora SAFE. At least they tried, even if they failed! Maleficent (2014) portrays them as nothing more than stupid buffoons who only care about saving their own skins. Aurora was just a means to an end for them; they have no relationship with her like they do in the original. The movie also took away their own personalities, so they are no different from each other. I can't even keep track of which fairy has which name! Watching them on screen with everything they say or do was as cringe worthy as I expected it to be. King Stefan has to be one of worst written villains I have seen in a while. He has no real motivation for what he does; we see him as having nothing in the beginning, and then the movie glosses over his relationship with Maleficent in order to ""get to the good part"" where he steals her wings in order to be king. After that, he wages war on Maleficent for cursing his daughter, and yet he only looks at Aurora as afterthought property. Why is he even after Maleficent then? What else has she done to him other than cursing his daughter?Elle Fanning as Aurora was very impressive. I do think she gave the character more of a personality that was lacking in the original, and she stole the film in every scene she was in. Unfortunately, that wasn't enough to save the movie, nor were Maleficent's interactions with Diaval, as enjoyable as they were. And of course, Maleficent does not turn into a dragon in this movie. I have to ask; why, Disney? You knew how loved of a villain Maleficent is, and her being a dragon is one of the many reasons why. Also, we live in an age where technology and special effects are abundant; you didn't use the opportunity to see how your most iconic villain looks as a dragon when done with live-action CGI? Why would you waste a perfectly good opportunity like that? Besides the fact that Maleficent is not evil in this film, she also is very wimpy and pathetic. She can't do ANYTHING. When we see her fight an army at the beginning, all she does is fly around and slap a few soldiers with her wings. The tree monsters did most of her fighting for her. In Sleeping Beauty, she could transport herself to another place in a matter of seconds, she could shoot lightning from her staff, and she could transform into another form other than her own. She didn't do any of that in this movie. Just like with Alice in Wonderland, Disney wasted a perfectly good opportunity to effectively adapt their animated work to the live-action screen. Maleficent may not be the absolute worst movie I've seen, but it's definitely in my bottom list now."
1348,tt1587310,1,"Went to the theater, expecting to experience the dark side of Angelina Jolie who plays a vengeful fairy with lofty wings and left the theater feeling astonished by how beautifully the movie has changed my perspective towards the antagonist.The remake of the classic Disney movie, ""Sleeping Beauty"" timely and soundly pans out by wonderfully depicting both beautiful and gloomy sides of fairy land of Maleficent that feud with selfish humans. The Visual effects and acting are so magnificent that mysterious creatures and the cast look totally in sync. The plot naturally goes along with coherent and succinct narrations that add an in-depth storytelling. Not to mention a good composition that captures significant moments without boredom. There are a lot more to feel, enjoy, and learn from what I would call, ""One of the most underrated movies of the year"" based on how the score is given. Not a Disney movie fan? Doesn't like a female protagonist? I don't think it will matter because once you start watching, you will be mesmerized by the imposing world and the ambivalent emotion of Maleficent."
1349,tt1587310,9,"I have waited a long time for this film and it did not disappoint!The film is very entertaining with stunning visuals and impressive action scenes. This is definitely Angelina's film and she is incredible as Maleficent.Supporting cast are also impressive and Elle was perfect casting for Aurora. The 3d was also good and really did enhance many scenes. The score by James Newton Howard really blew me away and adds magic to the film.My screening was all made up of adults which surprised me. The trailers for the film really give the film a dark tone, however the actual film has many light Disney moments. I highly recommend this film and the 3d is worth paying a bit extra!"
1350,tt2980706,6,"Took my 5 year old to see this fully knowing the franchise is worn out after having seen the disappointing Cars 2 and the first Planes. The plot is more interesting here as it plays out like an 80 minute episode of Rescue Heroes. The animation is fantastic as you would expect. Having animated planes allows for more panoramic views of the woodlands and fires.Sounds like kids were bored during the sad parts. The story didn't really need this as it's all predictable. You knew Rusty would defeat the odds to save the day in the end. Dane Cook voiced Rusty similar to Owen Wilson's Lightning McQueen, very down to earth without being over the top. There is certainly nothing groundbreaking here but the action scenes were good enough for my son to say he liked it (which is all that really counts!)."
1351,tt2980706,7,"Surprisingly to my knowledge, Planes: Fire and Rescue is not a cash in on the Cars Series. Unlike most sequels, The film was made to show the day in a life scenarios of firefighters fighting fire season where here in British Columbia where I live, the fires threaten many people. This is one of the best things about the film, Disney Toons, who is the studio behind the first Planes movie shows they're capable of living up to the standards of their Farther and Mother animated studios which shocked me. At 84 minutes long, the movie opens up with a message dedicating this movie to all the firefighters who risked their lives. So now on to the film, Dusty Crophopper has won many trophies. But on the eve of a festival in Propwash Junction, his gearbox is damaged and his friends tell him he may never fly again. After an accident, the main town firefighter Mayday is in danger of losing his job and Dusty tries to get himself Certified as a Firefighter to get his job back. But is in danger of a greedy lodge owner trying to ruin everything and his life. The most memorable characters I found in the movie was Dipper. The main girl plane of the movie. Like Ashanti from the last film, she is a new 'Friend' of his. I put it like that because she is actually a very creepy stalker. I felt uncomfortable around her because I was worried this relationship might lead to something creepier. Also, Blade Ranger played by Ed Harris is memorable mainly because this lead firefighting plane was in a show called 'Chops' which is the Cars Universe equivalent of Cops and Magnum PI. Animation wise, it got better. The animation is lively and thanks to the sound effects it makes the animation more convincing when Dusty and the gang are out battling fires. The story I liked. Because it has some flare to it. It gets sad within minutes, it gets evener sadder without an hours running time and is more serious than the first. More maturity to it, more life to the world, more character development, it is bigger and better. Some of the stuff is funny too. In one scene, Dusty is shown a VHS tape with the Cover of Howard the Truck, then to see its not that, but 'Chops' as I said before. I was laughing so hard when they showed that.Overall, Planes: Fire And Rescue proves that you can do more with a sequel than just cash in on it, you can tell a engaging story that will tell you about life. It really was a better sequel and should be shared with the whole family.78/100 BP.S: THE MUSIC STILL ROCKS! THANKS MARK MANCINA!"
1352,tt2980706,8,"OK, maybe wasn't the year movie but it's quite decent, it's much, too much better than cars 2 and for one instant i thought that it was a Pixar movie, okay, okay, maybe doesn't reach the quality from Pixar but Disney is improving in the stories and it left a very good taste. The scenes and animations are excellent and the story isn't only for kids, on the contrary it's quite decent for the adults, the characters feel like a real persons and its much better than the first movie. The only bad thing that i see is that Disney could improve the background of the leader copter or even change it, because Disney follow the same way since the cars story, one ace that teaches or trains for a bad past happening, maybe this doesn't bad but could be better. In summary it's an excellent movie from Disney and without songs, yeah!"
1353,tt2980706,8,"Planes: Fire and Rescue is about second chances. Dusty is a hot shot plane until one day he is at a crossroads in life, so he decides to join the world of fire rescue. Filled with a cast of fun characters this movie touts on bravery and the forgotten machines that protect us during unexpected natural disasters. In this case it is fire. There is a little bit for everyone, excitement, romance, and team work. This movie is cute and has a fun story line. The animated characters give a reality to the behind the scenes of fire fighting. It also gives you a boast on the optimism of new opportunities. No matter what happens you are able to reinvent yourself and be a part of the team. Colorful and enigmatic Planes: Fire & Rescue make you ready to take on a life of adventure."
1354,tt2980706,8,"What a funny and entertaining film! I did not know what to expect, this  is the fourth film in this vehicle's universe with the two Cars movies  and then the first Planes movie. I was wondering if maybe Disney pushed  it a little bit. However, Planes: Fire and Rescue is an entertaining  film that is a fantastic sequel in this magical franchise.   The story isn't about just one topic. This is a little bit of humorous  romance and also a lot of action. They make some pretty funny jokes  while adding a little sprinkle of drama and a great message for the  kids as well.  The story starts when Dusty sadly learns that a key component in him is  broken and he thinks he will never race again. When a fire breaks out  in his airport, they realize the town needs a second firefighter. Dusty  steps up to the plate and goes into training. If you want to find out  what happens and if he becomes a firefighter, you have got to watch the  film.   What a great add-on to the series; the jokes are perfect. Julie Bowen  (Lil' Dipper) is funny through the end. Also, there are a lot of great  messages and a lot of references to things in real life. However, this  film is very predictable. Ten minutes in, I knew the ending, so it  probably would be more captivating for a younger audience. Also,  Planes: Fire and Rescue is very similar to the last three films. There  is a challenge, a serious character and some comedy. Other than that,  the voices are well done and they even changed a Native American folk  tale into the version of vehicles just for this film! Very clever!  My favorite scene is when Dusty first arrives at the firefighting  station for his training. He is introduced to some Smoke Jumpers, cars  that parachute into the fire to tackle fallen trees and save wildlife.  One nearly takes off his head and the other two introduce themselves.  Once they all get acquainted, the first fire breaks out and cars and  planes all get into action in a well-choreographed manner!   This is a kid's film and nothing really is here that parents should be  worried about. I recommend it for ages 3 to18. Even kids that don't  understand it will enjoy the bright colors. I give this film 4 out of 5  stars for great jokes and a fantastic story line, even though a bit  predictable.  Reviewed by Gerry O, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic."
1355,tt2980706,6,"The first ""Planes"" was a pleasant surprise. It may have had practically the same ""race-against-all-odds"" story as ""Cars"", ""Turbo"" and many other animated films. But ""Planes"" still managed to be distinct and charming on its own, for both kids and adults.We get a lot of this homespun country charm again in this second installment called ""Planes: Fire and Rescue."" Our hero cropduster Dusty is having problems with his gear box and cannot push his engine to racing anymore. A fire at his hangar revealed the inadequacy of the fire-fighting capabilities of his area, so Dusty decided to try and have himself accredited as a Fire-Fighter. For adults, this may be an average affair for the most part. Even my tween kids did not too interested about watching it. Personally, my favorite part was when it was revealed that Dusty's stern mentor Blade Ranger (authoritatively voiced by Ed Harris) was once an actor in a TV cop-show called ""CHoPs"", which had the very familiar theme song of 70's motorcycle cop show ""CHiPs""! The nostalgia brought a smile to my face.The story is pretty slim, standard and predictable, so this episode spent a lot of time showing grand forest vistas, amazingly realistic and scary fire scenes and more amazing aerial feats by Dusty and the other fire-fighting aircraft. Despite the fact that this is a film for kids, I give it props for tackling a form of heroism not usually shown on the big screen -- fire and rescue teams."
1356,tt2980706,1,I do not understand why everyone is so down on this movie. The story is original - talking planes fighting forest fires - can't recall that being done before. The animation is top notch. The characters are funny. The movie went really quick....which is a good thing in my mind. There were NO political messages as was the case with the Cars movies. They could have easily spun a global warming message with the fire fighting but didn't go there. Be sure to sit through the credits to find what happens to the park administrator. This movie is much better than Planes and almost on par with Cars II.
1357,tt2980706,1,"It was great to see a true kid movie that was still entertaining for adults. The movie was well geared towards young kids, with age appropriate themes, just the right amount of tension, and a solid story. A much more cohesive movie than Cars 2 and a different style story from either of the Cars movies or the 1st Planes. In truth, my kids would have loved to see another racing movie as they love cheering Dusty or Lightning McQueen on, but as the parent, it was nice to see a different story line. This is not a movie I'd seek out as an adult without young kids, but tagging along with them was a fun time for all. The tribute and dedication to actual firefighters was a nice touch as well, adding some depth to a kid fair. Some reviews have criticized the film for lack of depth, intensity, detail of animation, etc., etc. Those reviews are misplaced as the movie is not aiming to be Citizen Kane or art house fair. Its a young kids movie, plain and simple, and its a good one at that. Nothing wrong with being a good kids movie that is aiming to only please kids. My kids loved it and could care less if the frame rate matched that of Frozen or Toy Story."
1358,tt2980706,9,"I love this movie and the first one. I don't care if it's made for kids; I'm 30 years old and have a great time with these movies!What really makes me love them so much is Dusty. He is a kind, caring character who never puts himself before others. The voice work is really good as well, as are the aerial shots. The filmmakers go to a lot of trouble to depict the flying sequences with as much realism as possible.The plots are pretty basic, but that's okay. This isn't The Lion King or How to Train Your Dragon level of story-telling, it doesn't need to be.I want to see more adventures with Dusty and his friends. I hope they are making a third one!"
1359,tt2980706,6,Dusty Crophopper is now a successful famous air racer. He returns to Propwash Junction to promote the upcoming Corn Festival. His gearbox malfunctions and there are no replacements. His racing career is over. He recklessly pushes to the limits and crash lands at the airport. Old fire truck Mayday barely is able to put out the resulting fire. Government inspectors put the airport on notice. They need another firefighting vehicle. Dusty decides to get certified as a firefighter.I like the start of this movie a lot. I like Dusty's problem. I really like Mayday. I don't really like the move away from Propwash Junction. First it feels unlikely and unwarranted. Also it's just better to stay with some of the characters especially Mayday. The fire and firefighters could easily come to Propwash Junction. The stakes would be elevated if his hometown is threatened with destruction. The fire fighting scenes are quite exciting and a vast improvement over the first movie. This is generally a better movie than the first. It's rare but I think this movie is too short. There is a straight to video quality to this that better writing could solve.
1360,tt1698641,7,Good movie. The reason I'd give this a 7 out of ten is because at the beginning it was ok nothing happening that much much but in the end all the drama came into it. There's a valuable lesson in this about that bad days can turn into good days
1361,tt1698641,8,"There's not really a lot that needs to be said about this movie. It is just a lot of fun and both kids and adults will find plenty to make them chuckle. There's plenty of 'slapstick' humor for the kids but it's all done so cleverly that adults will enjoy this movie just as much. An excellent cast of savvy adults and precocious kids work well together to portray a family that anyone would love to be a part of. The things that happen to them to make this, at first glance, one of the worst days ever will bring a smile to your face. It only goes for 81 minutes too, so littlies won't get bored and it doesn't overstay its welcome. See it."
1365,tt1698641,8,"The poster, the trailer and the genre will leave many assuming the worst. Another movie with over-the-top sight gags that would never happen in reality and are unable to entertain adult viewers. But this Alexander is not terrible. Instead it takes the high road in the family movie category by not depicting a dysfunctional family but instead showing us how parents and kids can pull together and overcome difficult circumstances. I was impressed that all the ""terrible"" things that happen could pretty much actually occur. And with four kids myself, let me assure you that some days really do play out similar to the one shown here. Of course, they aren't quite this crazy, but they are realistic enough family-inclined that will be able to relate to the antics on screen, and that's what makes the humor in this movie work so well.I was also pleased to see two parents who are not ""stupid"". Both the father and mother are intelligent and hard working and are doing their best to make a bad day better for their kids. Call it sentimental if you wish, but for those of us with family experiences I think you'll be pleasantly surprised at how entertaining and touching this film is. Within the scope of similar movies, this one is an 8 out of 10."
1366,tt1698641,2,"This movie is one of the absolute worst Disney movies that I have seen in recent days like Wreck It Ralph (2012), Frozen (2013), Snow White and the Hunstman (2012), all of which are not as good as Disney classics like The Little Mermaid (1989), Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), The Incredibles (2004), the toy story trilogy, Monsters Inc. (2001), Finding Nemo (2003), Pirates of the Caribbean series, Cinderella (1950), Fantasia (1940), Pinocchio (1940), or even Sleeping Beauty (1959), and also this movie is one of the worst movies of the year. The movie tells the story of a boy named Alexander (played by Ed Oxenbould) who is about to go to school and before he does he has a piece of bubble gum stuck in his hair and this clumsy event ends up with more stupid events that we as viewers are supposed to call funny for example everyone is scrambling to get ready and take care of the baby, his mom (played by Jennifer Garner opens the bathroom door in which her son Anthony (played by Dylan Minnette) naked and lots of other hell breaks loose. Director Miguel Arteta uses the same directorial technique as Dennjis Dugan when he directs one of those goofy Adam Sandler, but instead this one is with Steve Carell as the bumbling father during the course of the film. Even though the movie was very baldy written it had good moral standards because the only thing that this movie tries so hard to tell us is that people don't have to have good days all of the time and that sometimes you got to have the unfortunate bad days. The acting in this movie is very cheesy throughout with a decent cast humiliating themselves in a so called ""good movie for children"", (in which I don't think that this movie is goo d for anyone at any age, and why this movie had to be made I don't know. Anyway back to the reason why I think that the acting is terrible because you got Steve Carell and Jennifer Garner acting as very stupid parents Dylan Minnette and Kerris Dorsey acting as very dumb older siblings, Bella Thorne as Anthony's girlfriend Celia who is truly a spoiled princess, and we got a young Ed Oxenbould who tries so hard to give a good performance but he really gives the only good performance in the entire movie. What a waste of money."
1367,tt1698641,3,"Disney's trips into live-action comedy always have a consistent tone: bright, bubbly, bumbling, and inoffensive, with just the slightest hint of edge. Alexander is no different. If only its humor would land...and when it did, it wasn't beat to death. Instead of spending any amount of time on a coherent story or a real purpose, it sways towards cheap, dumb humor. Alexander is the kind of nonsensical slapstick ""family"" comedy that kids will inevitably enjoy and forget, while parents will be forced to endure and forget. Alexander is a preteen that has a bad but NORMAL day (popularity, girls, small chemistry fire); that same day, his family is celebrating some truly great developments (new job, best-selling book, first prom). Alex decides, out of spite or loneliness or something, that his misery deserves company, so he wishes for them to have a horrible day. And they do. And by the end of the movie, they area better family?! What's the lesson in that?! If things aren't going your way, then hope the people you love have it even worse? The premise could've been solid: really push the over-the-top notion of this down-on-his-luck kid struggling to survive juxtaposed against a perfect and aloof family. They even hired some great performers that could've really gotten some genuine laughs. Unfortunately, most of these actors are completely wasted, and in the end, Alexander tries to have its cake and eat it too, half its toe in fantasy and the other half in sloppy reality. Maybe I'm asking too much from a kid's film, but Alexander is a pointless and mostly laughless outing."
1368,tt1698641,8,"One, I never watch comedies for plot or message. I'm sure all of them have something to say, but please, for the love of God, if you want to produce a comedy, focus on the comedy. I still laugh at dramas and action movies but their label is still not primarily comedy.This is silly comedy and still better than most comedies that focus exclusively on sex and gross jokes just so they can look mature and smart. There are unfortunately not a lot of comedies like this one. It may be for kids but I did enjoy it a lot on my own, too.You should relax more before watching a comedy. If you've ever watched a family comedy before, you'll enjoy this too."
1369,tt1698641,7,"This was a total blind watch. I mean knew nothing about it. I had never read the book (didn't even know there was a book). Hadn't even watched the trailer. It was just brief (81 minutes) and lightweight (Disney family comedy) and both of those just happened to meet my particular criteria yesterday. To my complete and utter surprise, I loved it.Let me just be real clear. I loathe Disney. Loathe it. It's history and iconography do nothing for me, save perhaps make me a bit queasy. It's not that I'm some artsy-fartsy, highfalutin type either. Disney just doesn't agree with me. But despite a lot of Disney trappings, I thought AatTHNGVBD was an energetic and genuinely funny little movie that left me not queasy, but with a bit of a sugar buzz. I don't know that there's a genuine moment in the entire thing, but it plays its tune more skillfully than most Disney fare."
1370,tt2245084,1,"Please don't listen to the bad reviews and watch this yourself.I registered with IMDb just to write this. That is how much faith I have in this film. I really cannot believe some of these bad reviews.. ""Not a kids film""?? kids would go mental for this.Animation was nothing short of exquisiteComedy was extremely funny (and i'm not one for comedies)Story line was really great tooAlso made me cry a little... mehplease please please watch how awesome this is. i'm nearly 28 and I absolutely loved it."
1371,tt2245084,9,"Inspired by Frozen I started my search for new Disney movie which will offer me same ""Disney magic"" as i experienced in Lion King, Pocahontas, Bugs life, Frozen etc.So I found Big hero 6, and the magic started. This movie is made for all ages. What i find very interesting in this new Disney movie is that he is very educational, specially for children, but grown ups will enjoy ether. characterization is very deep , and you will feel as you are one of the characters in this beautiful story. Visual effects are stunning, so u will experience another Disney master piece. After seeing this movie , I would really recommend it to all movie lovers, especially fans of the Disney cartoon movies. If you are looking for an intelligent and inspiring cartoon movie for your youngest, you can stop looking because you just found it."
1372,tt2245084,1,"Big Hero 6 is another in a line of many successful Disney animated movies. And rightly so, might I add. The movie is about a boy, Hiro, his friends, Nerds and a health care prototype robot, Baymax. They live in a not so distant, technologically advanced future in a city called San Fransokyo. The story is action-packed comedy with dramatic elements to it and, as such, is appropriate for all ages. If you love Marvel movies, you will most definitely like this one as well. If you are more akin to beautiful landscapes and animated design, then by all means, this is the movie you will want to watch. If you are feeling down, the abundance of comedy, present in this movie is sure to make your day up. There is also a lot to learn from this movie, as some of the most important things (as well as most painful) in our lives, are depicted in this movie. Plus, the movie features one quite notorious figure (without too many spoilers). In short, the movie is a must see for children and for grown-ups as well, if they have a child lurking somewhere within them. Do not make a mistake and pass on a beauty of this movie."
1373,tt2245084,1,"I went to watch this movie with my son aged 10 and daughter aged 7 - it was my son who was especially keen to see this, and to be honest, I wasn't really expecting much, as I hadn't watched any trailers about it, or heard much about it, & I thought it maybe more a boys' movie and my son would enjoy it more than my daughter or myself... However... For the entire movie, myself and both of my children were completely immersed in it, and it evoked a range of thoughts, feelings and emotions in all of us, which included laughter and reducing us to tears (and I don't usually cry easily!). We all came out from the cinema each wanting our very own Baymax, and we were talking about and reliving moments from the movie for weeks after! My son who is a huge Marvel fan too spotted and enjoyed that he could make connections with Big Hero 6 to its Marvel origins. Mine and my children's conclusion... We loved this pretty much the same as we loved Frozen... Another fantastic animated movie from Disney!"
1374,tt2245084,9,"Back in 2009, Disney purchased Marvel Comics for four billion dollars. Shocking and surprising the world, many fans of both sides were curious whether Disney would make an animation film based on a group of characters from the comics. Three years later, Director Don Hall approached John Lasseter on making a film with Marvel Characters and found the Big Hero 6, a comic book series that even the most well known of comics didn't know who they were. In fact they were so obscure that Marvel themselves even forgot that they had the characters.Marvel gave Disney the liberty to change the characters so that they could be seen as a Disney Animation Film. And the result is simply refreshing.Big Hero 6 is a beautiful film, showcasing how much animation has become. The east and west coast mash up of San Fransokyo combines to make such a spectacular scenery, that the city may as well be a character to the film.The cast is also fun to watch. One annoyance films try to do is by shoving the diversity of characters in your face. Big Hero 6 doesn't do that, instead the focus is on the characters themselves and not the diversity, making it enjoyable to watch. One of the biggest highlights is the girls of the cast. I took my 3 nieces with my friends and I, and they loved how they were smart, enjoyable and didn't need to fall for a man. The cast is truly relatable, whether you are precise like Wasabi, positive like Honey Lemon or just a guy who loves media like Fred.Of course the star of the film is the robot of Baymax. Any scene that he is in steals the show, whether it is his introduction or his care for Hiro and Company.The Villain by far is one of the best villains in recent Disney history, he doesn't sing, dance or monologue, he simply gets the job done.The film showcases the action greatly by giving large scopes and music that fits exceptionally well. Emotionally, the film captures the audience by showcasing the bond of brotherhood between Hiro and his older brother Tadashi, as well as his friend Baymax who is like a Surrogate brother to our main hero.A strong lesson in this film, is that family can be more than blood related, you have friends, who become part of that. That really showed how much I cared for the loved ones around me, especially my older brother who is in the military, creating robots and fixing medical equipment.If there was one complaint I would give, I would've like to see a little bit more about the rest of the team. Other than that, Big Hero 6 is a heartwarming tale that captures something for the entire family.Big Hero 6 is another showing that Disney can continue to make great films after the juggernaut that was Frozen. This film showcases that the Disney Revival (Films such as The Princess and the Frog, Tangled, Wreck-it-Ralph and Frozen) is not over yet, and I cannot wait to see what the next film has to offer."
1375,tt2245084,9,"Hiro is a teen genius who seems to waste his time until his brother sets him on a right track. Tragedy strikes, and Hiro teams up with new friends to find the truth...eventually saving the day.Baymax is a robotic healthcare assistant that could have been developed as the usual annoying sidekick that has the heart of gold, but he just has a heart of gold here--as in doing research, his only intention is to help whomever he can.On a scale from 1 to 10, I rate this movie a 9 because its heart and soul outweigh the problems I have with it. Some scenes might be upsetting to younger viewers, but it is perfect for all ages.My issues:1. One of the characters sounds stereotypical. 2. The villain's identity and motive feel tacked on.I know the primary audience is not going to notice things like this, but I do...and I this happens to be one of those times that I cannot let it go."
1376,tt2245084,1,"To be honest, when I saw the preview I thought it was going to be another Disney movie gone bad. So when the movies came around, I had really low expectations for it. But holy crap nothing has made me laugh this hard at a movie since maybe Amelie or Up! Baymax is a non-threatening huggable robot who's only purpose is to nurse those who are in need of medical attention. The only way to wake him up is to scream out ""OW"" and he is alive and will help you until you are better. The only way to put him back to sleep is to say ""I'm satisfied with your work"" (Or something like that I'm only paraphrasing) and he has gone back to sleep. But this movie isn't all comedy: it does have a bit of an emotional side to it which I won't go into too much detail about. However I do know that the movie isn't really like the comic books: the back stories of the characters aren't how they are in the movie and even the plot itself isn't like how the movie is, so for the devoted comic book fans, I understand if you hate this movie. However the people who didn't read the comics confuse me when they say it's ""Cliche"" ""awful"" ""boring"". I found none of these things in the movie at all. I was smiling right from the beginning and found myself a little teary-eyed towards the end. So I do recommend this movie if you're up for a nice light movie with a lot of laughs: it might be better than you think."
1377,tt2245084,8,"My family got tickets to an early showing. The movie was excellent. The atmosphere was refreshingly different, the characters fleshed out, the plot touching, and the humor was rich and consistent . I would recommend this one to anyone, and especially to couples and families with children.Big Hero 6 really blew me away, I expected it to be good since Disney is having another animation renaissance but once the credits began to roll all I could do was wish it was longer. This movie has something for everyone, comedy, action, some despair. In fact, surprisingly the only thing missing was romance, which is fine with me. If you love superheroes, robots, and animated films, I think you've found your holy grail."
1378,tt2245084,1,"Disney has brought many gifts and rarely disappoints me. Big Hero 6 is one of the best Disney films I have seen since last year's Frozen. This film is fun, clever, imaginative, and filled with spectacle. While the film is somewhat similar to Pixar's The Incredibules due the film's plot dealing with robots and and children with superpowers, it is very enjoyable and would easy please children as well as parents. Big Hero 6 is not only brings out the charm with heart-filling characters and comic relief but has some of the most dazzling CGI I have seen in a Disney movie. The animators did a fantastic job on the character models and the environment was nice looking. My favorite character would probably be Baymax. What's not to like about a funny, inflatable robot who cracks funny one-liners,has the power to heal, and assists Hiro (main character) on his quest to defeat an evil scientist? I can't tell you how much I enjoyed this movie. I recommend this movie to all parents and children. Big Hero is a family thrill ride!!!"
1379,tt2245084,8,"Honestly, I put off watching this because I didn't feel like I would enjoy it so much. I was proved wrong. Right from the start, the fresh animation of this film along with the brilliant editing and voice acting had me engaged. Though the plot is pretty flat and for kids, the concept is pretty new (in that it hasn't been totally overdone), dealing in robotics which allowed them to show some cool stuff. But the story being from Disney, did have moments of it being 'too easy' as well as a few stock characters but it wasn't such a big deal. The story was told well, and wasn't cheesy or boring at all. The freshness of the voices and the animation really put this film together.The connection between the voices and animation really showed on screen the chemistry between the characters, and this worked to gain the sympathy of the viewer's at certain scenes. I thought that was well done, the characters were developed well in relation to each other. And I know I keep saying this, but I just really like the animation, and the effects. Baymax is so cute, and the other character's have a kind of Asian feel to them. It's also quite cool how the animated characters almost always resemble the actors voicing them (I guess this is intentional).However, watching the trailer again, I notice that they miss some of the scenes out. I mean if you put it in the trailer, you've got to put it in the film! I would've liked to have seen the scene with Baymax and the soccer ball.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com"
1380,tt2180411,6,"I remember waiting for this movie to come out. I'd grown up listening to Bernadette Peters. Performed lesser characters myself until I finally got to be the Witch. This movie had an all star cast and I was so excited.End credits roll, and I sat there more angry than sad. A musical with so many moral lessons and all the movie can focus on is KILLING the Giant as the big finale. The whole movie ends with Children Will Listen and all I can think of is the kids who just learned that it is ok to kill to get what you want.Yes the Giant dies in the musical but because of the limitations of stage the scene is less about getting that giant but focuses on the people struggling to survive against giant odds. Also, the true finale of the musical has a wonderful lesson that is completely cut out the movie. ...There is one last reprise of the theme ""Into the woods"" One verse says, ""... Into the woods but not to stray or tempt the wolf or steal from the giant."" Because, let's face it, the giant is the most innocent party in the whole play. She was kind to the thieving, murderous boy, Jack.""Into the woods, each time you go There's more to learn of what you know. ..Into the woods to mind the wolf, to Heed the witch, to Honor the giant. .... into the woods. Then out of the woods -- and happily ever after!"" Then Cinderella says, ""I wish..."" and everyone looks at her in horror .... because, let's face it, the one thing humans are good at is forgetting life lessons.None of this is in the movie ...Not to mention the missing characters such as the narrator/father (well, the many funny theater scenes) ... and all the much needed comic relief crafted into the second half of the musical. (Because the body count is no laughing matter. :)The musical has an intermission after they all get their happy ever after ... so when you see them again time has passed & they are all back to wanting more. Then the giantess starts destroying things as she looks for Jack (because he murdered her Husband ... can't stress that jolly tidbit enough) and their petty wants get pushed aside as life completely is changed for everyone.I would like to say that my disappointment is like that of one whose favorite book is made into a movie ... not everything can fit into those 2 hours. However, this movie did a disservice to those who have never seen the real deal. I have see it/been in it. Can spout almost every line ad nauseam and yet I still cry at the end of even High school Productions. This movie left me cold. I still cry at the ""eyes of an angel..."" animal commercials, but the movie just didn't provide me with an emotional connection.Then there is the scene where the baker runs off after finding out his wife has died. In the play the mysterious man (aka his father) says, ""We disappoint, we disappear, we die but we don't. . . "" and the baker sing a short heartbreaking song that ends, ""...No more giants waging! Can't we just pursue our lives w/our children & our wives 'til that happy day arrives, how do you ignore
All the witches, all the curses, the false hopes, the good-byes, the reverses
All the wondering what even worse is still in store
All the children
All the giants .... just, no more ""In theater we are taught that the actor NOT crying is powerful. You sob because his words resignate, not because he is showing us how sad he is. It's the writer's version of show don't tell.Then there are the children. According to the bonus features, the director feels its supposed to be children and not teenagers. I very very much beg to differ. Hello little girl is a seduction song and has many innuendos that worked sort of ok as Lilla looks 13 -14. Jack is a simpleton but not a child. With them as teenagers, there is a growing up they are suddenly forced to do. They truly have no one. The song, No one is alone didn't seem as powerful because these kids are so young that obviously someone will take care of them. And it seems odd that the baker is willing to say no to letting them stay with him when Jack can't be over 10. Now, if they were teens, then his reluctance is more understandable. Red is a bit scarier in the musical, pulling out her knife ... a fact which makes it funnier when the baker is horrified his wife would leave the baby with Red.The baker and his wife do not argue as much as they do in the play. Theirs is NOT a perfect marriage. No marriage is, but the reality in their relationship are what allow her to be seduced by the prince and let us accept it as paet of her character flaw.In the play, Rapunzel blames the witch for her unhappiness and says, ""because of you, I will never be happy again."" The Witch, whose own mother was NOT great example of motherhood (I mean seriously, who puts a curse on their own child?) Truly tries to protect her child by going to the way opposite extreme (there are parents out there like that). Yes, she does some horrible things in the name of love and she is definitely not a nice person. Her mistakes and how they affected her child go with the theme of the play. Later, Rapunzel is stepped on by the giant as she runs away from the Witch who is trying to save her which changes the whole tone of the Stay with me reprise ... they should've just got rid of that reprise if they were going to change that storyline.I rewatched the movie recently thinking maybe I was so disappointed in 2014 because I had too high of expectations. But no, it is because they took a deep, well-crafted musical and morphed it into an odd sort of movie. They should have just done act 1 and ended it there. Oh, wait, that's basically what they did."
1381,tt2180411,1,"Okay, first of all, let me address the 1-star crowd. Yes, it's a musical. How could you not know that it was...this musical's been around for nearly THIRTY YEARS NOW! Ahem. Okay, yes, it has dark elements, including references to pedophilia. THIS WAS IN THE ORIGINAL MUSICAL! In fact, Disney toned it down severely! Horrible score? Tell that to Sondheim - he wrote the pieces (and won awards for them)...sigh. Some people just don't ""get it"".This is the first film adaptation of ""Into the Woods"". Several others had been contemplated, worked out, even started casting for, but this is the only one that was ever completed...NOT because it was ""horrible"" ""awful"", or whatever, but because it was such a daunting task! I thought that this movie was a wonderful work of art that addresses a lot of life issues (after all, Sondheim is also a noted psychologist). Others were upset that it was a musical. Oh, boo-hoo. People are singing their lines. How un-Disney-like.Okay, I will agree with one point: It is NOT your typical Disney fairy tale. Nope. Not at all. Instead, it's more true to the original Brothers Grimm stories...let me repeat that...true to the original Brothers Grimm...if you don't know what I'm speaking of, if you think Snow White was about dancing dwarfs and tweeting birds, then you really need to visit a library.People are screaming up and down that this is most definitely NOT a family film. Um...hello? Do you even know what ""PG"" stands for? It means ""Parental Guidance suggested""...this means that you, as a parent, should decide if it's right for your child to view. In other words, BE A PARENT! Sheesh...Okay, enough of that.""Into the Woods"" is a musical. If you don't like musicals, don't watch it.""Into the Woods"" is a blending of different fairy tales from their original DARK, FOREBODING, DISTURBING perspectives. If you want butterflies and songbirds and happily-ever-after, go watch the earlier Disney greats.""Into the Woods"" is dark. It's creepy. It's disturbing...and it's great. You just need to be in the proper frame of mind. I knew what I was getting into, and I loved it. If you're expecting ""heigh-ho, heigh-ho, it's off to work we go"", you aren't going to like it.This movie isn't for everyone, true enough, but for those of us who ""get it"", it's WONDERFUL!"
1382,tt2180411,1,"I have seen both the original Broadway play and this film adaptation, and I can gladly say that this lives up to the original's reputation. The only major change is with one aspect of Rapunzel's storyline.There are 3 types of people who hated the movie: 1. Parents who thought this isn't suitable for kids. Well, this doesn't say anything about how good the movie actually is. Yes, not all the content is for kids; heck the original isn't meant for kids at all. Even then, I don't think its that worrisome. If you think it is, just don't let your kids watch it; but you can enjoy the story. 2. Fans of the original who are complaining about every little change. People, its an adaptation; certain things need to be changed when transitioning to a different medium of storytelling. And some of the small changes are actual improvements to the original. 3. Those who weren't expecting a musical. I don't get this one. If you don't like musicals, fine! But you can't rate it 1 star just because its a musical!If you are looking for a typical Disney movie, look away. But if you care about originality and want to witness familiar stories in a different light, this is it. It has Disney characters but uses them to deliver a more realistic and mature point of view about the world. The story as a whole has some really good messages, but people seem to be stuck up on the fact that it defied their expectations. As Into the Woods points out, your actions have real consequences and sometimes your wishes come true but not quite in the way you expected. Be ready for an unexpectedly twisted journey...""Into the woods- Each time you go, There's more to learn Of what you know.""10 Stars!"
1383,tt2180411,7,"I saw this movie, and everything was *awesome!*......until Act I ends. Before I get to negatives, let me say the music is very faithfully reproduced here. The singing is good (in some cases great), the acting is good, the costumes and ""sets"" are also often good. Everything was in place to make this the definitive version of Into The Woods......and then they threw Act II out the window. People unfamiliar with the musical might not notice or care about the changes to Act II (or technically Act III), but fans of the musical should be warned that this show is completely drained of all gravitas and pathos. Also, several wonderful songs have been cut- it will tick you off. SPOILERS FOLLOW!!!So if you've seen the musical, you know how Act II goes. More importantly, you know the great songs there. Well for some reason (PG rating, perhaps), Disney has cut everything about Act II that gives the entire show meaning. #1- Rapunzel does not die. This ruins the Witch's arc in Act II. No reprise of Children Don't Listen, and the witch leaves the movie rather abruptly in Last Midnight. And of course, Rapunzel is almost completely pointless to the story now, since nothing bad ever happens to her and her prince stays happily married to her, which brings me to...#2- No second ""Agony."" This was my favorite song in the damn show, and they cut it. Of course, the cut everything building up to this too- We don't get to see the princes and their wives tire of married life, nor do the baker and his wife, which comes to...#3- The Baker and his wife have no troubles in Act II. There's no fall from grace for these two- they never have to deal with a stressful marriage. The wife only kisses the prince (no sex), and the action leading up to that point is far from justified. Her lyrics about ""And/Or/Both"" are groundless here- it's still a fun song, but there's no reason for her to be singing it. #4- No Narrator. He shows up as an apparition, but does not get to sing ""no more,"" which is the other best song in the musical. This also hastens the Baker's journey- while he still hits the main points of his arc, we're denied any real struggle here. #5- Arguably, the entire point of the musical is missing. The stage version breaks down ""happily ever after"" and teaches a real lesson about loss and how gray the world really is. The movie...does not. So I can't really recommend this to fans of the musical, unless you can accept the loss of Act II. People unfamiliar with the musical might still enjoy it."
1392,tt2097298,1,"After a million years as an IMDb member I'm finally inspired to write a review. This movie is guileless and sweet in the most beautiful way. Not heavy-handed, no huge buildup over the races (in all aspects of the word), but rather huge focus on interpersonal relationships and the judgments every human makes about one another. There's also huge pride in the small working towns I've personally driven through on my way to somewhere else, and the seemingly small people whose backs we live off of. There is so much heart here. I'm surprised this is a Disney movie.Anyway, I believe love drives us. And this is such an affirmation of the different types of love and relationships that can push us in the best ways and help us achieve greatness. I'm so deeply pleased to have seen this film. Every one of us has a moment or period when we are down for the count. We don't always handle it with grace. That doesn't mean we are without grace."
1384,tt2180411,6,"Half the hate reviews I'm seeing on this website are all saying ""The trailers didn't announce that it was a musical"". 1. The music in the trailer is the character's singing voices! Please pick up on that! 2. Yes, it is a musical. I really don't see how a movie can get so much hate just because they didn't know it was a musical! At least try to appreciate the music in it instead of just hating it because you don't like actual singing. 3. THIS WAS ORIGINALLY BASED ON A STAGE PLAY BACK IN THE 80'S, OF COURSE IT IS GOING TO BE FREAKING LONG! Honestly the people act as if they've never sat through a 2 hour movie before! Schindler's List was over 3 hours and that is a freaking masterpiece, but god forbid a musical being just over two hours. 4. If you came in to just see Johnny Depp: Stop being so stupid and be warned he's only in the movie for 5 minutes. 5. IT'S PG-13! It warns you that some scenes will frighten young children. However if you think that the movie version is disturbing then don't take your kids to the stage play! In my opinion. I loved this version just as much as the stage play. I have high hopes for Lilla Crawford and that she gets more roles in other movies. Her voice was phenomenal and Stephen Sondheim's musicals are a bit of a challenge to play in. So my respects to her. Anna Kendrick's voice was amazing, and she played a brilliant Cinderella. Meryl Streep is brilliant as always. Emily Blunt had a hidden talent I wasn't aware of. The two men (forgot the names sorry) who played the two prince's had great voices too! I could go through the cast and break down on their talent, but I think I'd go over the 1, 000 word count. But please be warned, this is a musical. I believe it is a great musical and I really want others to give it a chance. It sucks that that the rating is 6.6 and I'm afraid it will get lower :( 10/10"
1385,tt2180411,4,"I love Stephen Sondheim's musical classic Into The Woods, so I was more than excited to see Rob Marshall's new motion picture adaptation. Not only is Into The Woods one of my favorite musicals, but Rob Marshall was the director who brought Kander & Ebb's Chicago to the big screen in 2002 – an effort which resulted in the first musical to win the Best Picture Oscar since 1968! In fact, since Baz Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge update in 2001, several major musicals have been successfully adapted to the big screen – including Chicago, Dreamgirls, and the unfairly criticized Les Miserables just two years ago.I hate to say it, but Into The Woods does not fall into this category. I found the film dreary, draggy, and quite frankly, boring. How can this be? It's the same dialogue, the same music, the same set, and the same costumes as we see on stage. But therein lay the problem. On stage, set designers create ""the woods,"" and the actors move in and out of these woods. We use our imagination to pretend the woods are larger than what we see on stage. Here, the woods are huge. After all, these are the movies. Unfortunately, the woods all look the same. Marshall may as well have filmed a stage performance. Furthermore, the sky is always cloudy, giving the picture a dirty, dingy feel.Into these woods, several classic stories interconnect, including Cinderella, Little Red Riding Hood, Jack & The Beanstalk, and Rapunzel. Tying all the stories together is the story of a baker and his wife, who are unable to conceive a child due to a curse placed on them by the witch who lives next door. On stage, characters from the various fairy tales bump into one another in hilarious fashion, and eventually all the loose ends are wrapped up and most of the characters live happily ever after.But the film has one major flaw, and that is that the loose ends are tied up too soon. The sun finally shines on Cinderella's wedding day, as all the townsfolk join the celebration. I looked at my watch and realized we were only an hour Into The Woods, causing me to wonder what director Rob Marshall was going to do with the rest of the movie. On stage, Cinderella's wedding is merely a formality – a necessary conclusion to the story we all know, but certainly not the end of the musical. Here, Marshall gives the wedding scene such heft – and differentiates it from the previous hour's worth of material – that we feel like it's time to get up and leave.At this point, the film version goes awry. The players begin behaving out of character for reasons never explained. For instance, how could the handsome prince consider Cinderella the love of his life one day, and then cheat on her the next? Why does Jack's mother die? (Her death is one of the funniest scenes on stage. Here, it happens so quickly, I wasn't even sure if she had died or not. And Jack's demeanor doesn't change one iota.) Another problem is Stephen Sondheim himself. You see, Sondheim is a lyricist. When he wrote the lyrics for Leonard Bernstein's West Side Story, the result was one of the best stage and screen musicals of all time. But when Sondheim writes his own melodies, the result is often wordy, tuneless ditties you won't remember two minutes after leaving the theatre. Again, on stage this is no big deal. In fact, it almost accentuates the material to feature the characters speaking and singing in similar speech patterns. But on screen, I had that, ""Not another song!"" feeling all through the third act – the way I did with Barbra Streisand's Yentl back in 1983.I certainly can't knock the performances, although Anna Kendrick's remarkable turn as Cinderella is the only one that stands out from the rest. Her character seems genuine, and she gives Cinderella a few new dimensions, rather than simply fulfilling the role we think we know from the fairy tale. Three-time Oscar winner Meryl Streep has been nominated for another Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her role as the witch. She's fine, but she won't win. I could name at least a dozen Streep performances better than this one.It's a disappointment to me that Into The Woods didn't adapt better to the big screen. That makes three films this season that I really wanted to like, and was disappointed at the outcome – Birdman, Inherent Vice, and now Into The Woods. Throughout the course of motion picture history, it often seems as though the best musicals are those written directly for the screen, such as Singin' In The Rain or Mary Poppins. Adapting material from another source is always risky. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. As I've thought more about Into The Woods, I wonder if this isn't one of those musicals that simply wasn't meant to adapt to the screen. Remember Richard Attenborough's inexcusable A Chorus Line? That's another great, intimate show that simply doesn't work on the large easel of the motion picture screen. I fear that's what we have here with Into The Woods."
1386,tt2180411,9,"I loved this film. I've seen the film version of the play starring Bernadette Perers and loved it as well. I think many watched it thinking it would be a happily ever after story but it's not and that's the point. I first heard about/watched the play version in a college drama class. The characters start out struggling but still idealistic. They believe they can achieve their wishes and set out to do that. Then, after they've each gotten what they thought they wanted they realized they didn't want it or in some cases they didn't want it yet. And while they're struggling to come to grips with the idea that maybe they didn't want their wishes granted after all, the giant attacks and knocks them for a loop. Characters die, marriages fail and they see that maybe happily ever after isn't an idealistic fairy tale dream but instead it's the reality of their acceptance of and for themselves as they are. I gave it a nine because I loved the narrator and missed him in this version and as well as a few other changes. Overall it was wonderful and I can't wait until my children are old enough to enjoy it with me."
1387,tt2180411,1,"For those who liked the play save your money and go see the play. This film was a poor adaptation with maddening unsympathetic characters. The extreme efforts and great acting of individuals could not make up for the horrible script, pedophilia and rape undertones, and horrible moral guidance. The songs are all sung in the near same tone and were poorly integrated with the action. This is the first film in 30 years I've wanted to throw my drink at, yell boo, and leave. I gutted out the last of the film to give an honest review. The film was so horrible it motivated me to open an account and review it. The premise was interesting and brought me in. The cast kept me sitting, hoping it got better. I can't get that time back. A very poor film for children, annoying and maddening for adults. With plot holes and inexplicable insertions. The cast tried their hardest and individually acted well but the film direction, production, script, and song lyrics made for a horrible product. The visuals were the only redeeming value. And not to spoil but the moral lessons are questionable at best."
1388,tt2180411,1,"Left the theater I just could not take the pain. Many others left as well Reading the reviews I am stunned at the number of positive reviews. Perhaps one of the worst movies I have ever seen I want those two hours of my life back. What am I missing, wonderful cast but the movie just dragged on and on with most songs boring at best. I did enjoy two princes singing - that was funny, but otherwise terrible movie. Save your money!! Cast was great but unused talent. What were folks thinking. Tried to nap during the movie but woken up by the the notes off key. Movie was confusing and just wandered from song to song without an much of a connection to a story. Again, I cannot get over how many positive reviews are out there as so many left the theaters as did I after about two-thirds of the movie and with no end in sight."
1389,tt2180411,1,"Spoilers, you've been warned.OK, so I've never been a Broadway/musical fan BUT, I do appreciate a good story when I see one. Into The Woods was not one of those good stories. First off, the story starts off with an incredibly repetitive and rather annoying song which is supposed to introduce the major characters but instead turns into a montage of all the major characters spouting the same lines with slight variations over and over again for 15 minutes too long. In reality, pretty much every song is the same repetitive nonsense with the exception of one song sung by the two princes which is refreshing in it provides just a little bit of humor which is utterly lacking throughout the rest of the film. Next problem is the lack of character development. All the characters feel shallow and you have a hard time finding a character to be interested in and honestly I was more interested in the damn cow for the majority of the movie than any of the main characters. Third problem I had was pacing, things go from 0 to 100 real fast and then it likes to hit a wall in the form of another repetitive 15 minute song in order to completely throw you off. Fourth problem is the really disturbing and graphic material that somehow slipped into a PG rated film i.e., Johnny Depp's character and the rather obvious allusion to pedophiles using candy to lure unsuspecting children or Cinderella carelessly sicking her bird friends on her step sisters to peck their eyes blind in some twisted sense of revenge, the list goes on and on. And last and probably the biggest problem I had with this film was the overall confusing plot. My girlfriend and I spent the majority of the movie trying to figure out exactly what was happening and just when we thought we were getting a grip on the plot the whole movie would make a U turn and head in a totally different direction. Characters' thoughts and actions are void of all logic. I may just be ignorant for never having read the play but I was utterly confused when the witch just decided she had enough of everyone and TURNED HERSELF INTO MUD. In addition, the story makes many really interesting connections between the characters but then simply fails to explore those connections, the biggest for me being that Rapunzel and the Baker are actually brother and sister. Instead of exploring this connection the two never even come into contact with one other nor do they actively pursue one another. What's worse is that Rapunzel seems to play no significant role in the movie whatsoever which is apparent when she just disappears part way through the movie with her prince never to be seen or heard from again.Overall, the film is incredibly boring, confusing, and at times, disturbing, and will leave you looking for any excuse you can think of to shuffle out of the theater in search of a movie actually worth watching."
1390,tt2097298,7,"Okay, Kevin Costner can do this character in his sleep. His ""Coach/Manager/Player who has seen it all"" character is standard stuff for him. It's basically ""Bull Durham"", ""Draft Day"", ""For Love of the Game"" all rolled into the same guy. That's not a bad thing. I like him in those roles. It's just nothing new. What's surprising is the plethora of fabulous performances by the kids and townspeople in this terrific little TRUE story. They ROCK this picture. Special recognition to the set designers who created a beautiful location for all the running sequences. It was a rich assortment of landscapes that mesmerized the visual senses on BluRay.Basic plot: Costner (Jim White) is a football coach at a reasonably successful high school program. Because of a mistake in the opening sequence, the coach is fired and lands in a dead-end town in Nowhere'sville, USA - aka McFarland, CA. The fish-out-of-water family has a few brushes with the local Mexican population where they think being the only (seemingly) white family in the area is a bad idea and are intending on moving immediately. Then Costner sees a kid running a sub-5-minute mile on his way to work in the produce fields with the rest of the population of minority workers in the area. What follows is fairly standard Disney stuff of our innocent but willing racially-inferior minnows who fight to get better against the racist, elitist killer whales (rich kids) of the other schools. What makes this watchable is how true the story is. Don't get me wrong. There are some formulaic sequences here. But how they pull it off is worth the cinematic journey. For Disney, I'm proud of them for taking a racial theme and turning it into a positive story for all involved.I have to say the reason I'm giving this a ""7"" is because of the EXCELLENT behind-the-scenes stories where the filmmakers interview the runners from the team, along with the real coach, Jim White, and Kevin Costner all at the same sitting. Hearing them reminiscing (the movie is set in 1989), talking about the movie, and showing genuine care and respect for their beloved coach and each other... It's what a coach could only hope for in the children who grow up to be fine adults. Mr. White created a dynasty of runners that forged an ironclad identity with hope for the future in this nothing town when nobody was giving them a chance. One man can still make a difference on a global scale if you work hard enough. It's inspiring stuff.The highest praise I can give this movie: My two teenage athlete children (soccer and baseball/softball) who have watched literally hundreds and hundreds of movies were against it. It was Disney for crying out loud. And a movie about CROSS COUNTRY no less. They would rather watch ""Mission Impossible 15"" or anything else. These are seasoned moviephiles. But Dad just wouldn't be denied. ;-) Within the first 15 minutes, they were hooked and enjoyed every minute of the rest of the movie. They even sat through the behind-the-scenes interviews. It was a family experience I won't forget. Well done, Disney.As a coach myself, this is the kind of stuff that inspires me to work with kids who don't have a future in their current situation. And if you're already a coach, it may open your eyes to kids who have natural talents that may be wasted on something other than where their true skills lie. Much recommended. :-)"
1391,tt2097298,8,"McFarland USA is much more than the regular feel good sports movie. The setting, acting, music, and story line blend perfectly to deliver a heart-warming tale. It is a film that touches all sides of this true story to make it stand out against the rest. By the time it's all done, you will feel like part of the McFarland family. Kevin Costner plays Jim White, a coach whose anger forces him move to a struggling, McFarland, California, where he begins a job teaching science and gym. In this predominately Latino town Jim and his family experience a culture they hadn't been exposed to in Boise, Idaho. Very early on something about these kids catches Jim's eye, their ability to run. With a little bit of work and convincing of some students and the school administration, Jim creates a cross-country team that he believes, can achieve greatness. The setting for this movie perfectly captures the feel for McFarland. Featuring plenty of dead grass, roaming dogs, endless fields, and low riders with ridiculous paint jobs, the viewer gets a feel for the town at the very beginning of the movie. Most of the people in this town are migrant workers. The run down buildings, chipping paint, and collapsing school display the poverty level of the town quite clearly. With a prison located across the street from the school, it is made clear that most kids have the choice of going to jail, or working in the fields. While the town is rather plain, the director did a great job of capturing the beautiful mountains and landscapes of the surrounding area. In addition to the beautiful scenery, the music chosen makes it feel like there is a mariachi band right in your room. The setting as a whole was delivered in a way that makes the viewer understand the economic state of the town and the surrounding area, which is a big help in supporting the plot.Every singe one of the actors in this movie played the role perfectly. I was stunned by the amount of character development in such a short period of time. By the end of the movie, you will feel connected to every character. Kevin Costner seems to be simply playing himself, but Carlos Pratts steals the show with his amazing portrayal of Thomas Valles. During a training session, Thomas has an emotional break down due to the combination of a stressful life at home and the endless cycle of poverty that the people of McFarland can't seem to break. It is here that the crying, shouting, angry voice of Thomas spills all the struggles of the migrant workers and the lives they live. The characters and the writing also allow for some comic relief. A man who's last name is White struggles to pronounce Hispanic names, and the stock character of a chubby Danny Diaz who is trying his best to keep up with the rest of the team.I'm impressed that the movie didn't contain a crazy amount of over dramatizations, because we all know that is the worst thing in the world. Considering it's a Disney sports movie based on a true story, you should know how it ends before you even watch it. I highly recommend you watch it anyways. It contains scenes that leave your hands sweating and your heart beating, and creates feelings similar to the first time you ever saw the Italian Stallion beat Apollo Creed in the ring. When it's all said and done, the town of McFarland, and especially its cross-country team, will hold a special place in your heart. Before you watch this movie, make sure your mom signs the permission slip, because you're about to go on a feel trip."
1400,tt0352248,1,"Truly inspiring story of James J. Braddock. This story is about more than boxing. It is about a man and his wife trying to raise a family in the tough times of the 1920s. And the integrity and example he shows his children in those times. Russell Crowe, Renee Zellweger and Paul Giamatti are just part of this incredible cast. It is a must see."
1401,tt0352248,9,"The dilemma: I hate boxing movies; I love Russell Crowe movies. I've already seen ""Million Dollar Baby"" and ""Raging Bull"" this year, and accidentally watched part of one of the ""son of Rocky"" serial movies on a Saturday afternoon. I feel like I am being punched, as Renee' Zellwegger's character Mae Braddock says, and I'm not as tough as these prize fighters.But this one has Russell Crowe in it. And that makes all the difference. It is not that Renee Zellwegger and Paul Giamatti, Paddy Considine, Bruce McGill and Craig Bierko, among others, give less than stellar performances: they all live up to their justifiably great reputations. You have to believe they are at the top of their game. But for all of Russell Crowe's reputation for being ""difficult"", it is hard to think of actors who can equal his personal force on the screen. He is brilliant. Ron Howard has made of the real life of Depression-era prize-fighter James J. Braddock a work of art. The camera work is phenomenal. Without using violins or cliché' pull-back shots showing the numbers of people homeless and in soup lines, Howard makes the Depression a visceral reality with scenes of near-hopeless men at the docks, pleading for a day's work; a stolen salami; Crowe's giving his daughter his breakfast piece of bologna, telling her he dreamed he was full. The bleakness of the times is the graininess and the sepia/greyness of the camera shots; the images are stark but completely descriptive. Crowe as Braddock with hat in hand and tears in his eyes, begging for twenty dollars so he can get his children back into his home, is the personification of pride sacrificed to desperation. But when Braddock is later asked at a press conference why he is fighting at his age and after so many poor showings, all he has to say is ""milk"" to be supremely eloquent.Doubtless many people know the history of James Braddock, and know the outcome of his fights, including the championship bout with Max Baer, who had already killed two men in the ring. If you don't know, DON'T look it up before you see the movie, and if you DO KNOW, DON'T TELL, but go. Analogous to watching Howard's film ""Apollo 13"", you may know the outcome, but there's wonderful suspense in the details. These were among the most exciting last twenty minutes I've seen on film. I didn't expect to be able to watch, but like Braddock's terrified wife Mae, I was unable to tear myself away.The audience was like a prize fight audience, cheering, booing, gasping, groaning during the fights. We applauded Braddock's wins, suffered his defeats. It is a great movie, with authentic heart. Solid A."
1393,tt2097298,9,"Greetings from Lithuania.It's hard imagine anyone who would not cheer a bit after watching ""McFarland, USA"" (2015). This is a true story, and the movie is truly good and sometimes moving. It's inspirational story like you have seen many times actually, but it is made so well that at running time 2 h 5 min this movie never drags and is involving from start till finish.Overall, ""McFarland, USA"" is sometimes routine and familiar, yet very entertaining movie. Kevin Costner is good in here, and although no Oscars will shine with this movie, it's nevertheless a very well made picture. Directing was solid - pacing of this movie is great. Music was nice, as well as cinematography. It's not very original picture, but a very fine one."
1394,tt2097298,8,"In making this movie Kevin Costner stuck to the formula, the one that most feel good sports movies use, and made it work beautifully. There are no unexpected fancy twists in this one. The acting is straight up and solid. The ethnic background of the movie adds to the movie in good way. I enjoy a few of the scenes that involve the interactions between the coach or his family and the locals. They demonstrate how cultural interaction and familiarity can eliminate fear and breakdown the walls that divide us. Don't get me wrong, the movie is not trying to give you a social/cultural lecture, this stuff comes naturally mixed with the main story line.If you like the genre, you'll enjoy this movie."
1395,tt2097298,8,"I've seen this film a few times, and again today after a long time. I can't get bored of it. A story about commitment, dreams, not giving up, family and sport. Excellent biopic with great directing, writing and performances. These type of films are right up Costner's alley."
1396,tt2097298,8,"Track coach Jim White is a newcomer to a predominantly Latino high-school in California's Central Valley. Coach White and his new students find that they have much to learn about one another, but things begin to change when White realises the boys' exceptional running ability. More than just physical prowess drives the teens to succeed. Their strong family ties, incredible work ethic and commitment to their team all play a factor in forging these novice runners into champions.......Sports movies featuring Kevin Costner are the cinematic equivalent of Cheese on Toast. You've had it before, numerous times, and you know what exactly what you are going to get. But too much of the stuff isn't too good for you.I'm a big Kevin Costner champion, he's always been a big screen presence, and even though he's had his shortcomings (The Postman was almost career suicide, but WaterWorld was not, I repeat, was not a flop) he still makes an ordinary film that little bit more extraordinary, because he just has that effortless class about him.As you'd expect, the films narrative is as predictable as day turns to night.White joins a school that isn't the best in the world. He sees potential in a few students, and learns of their hardship, he forms a cross country team, much to the frustration of family, colleagues. They get mocked by the river, better school, and fail their first attempt.Them there is a big montage, the voice of the group has a hissy fit, goes home and fights with his family. Costner bumps into him, they a have a conversation, and you know what? he rejoins the team and they do much better, and decide to have a party. After all the people Costner was alienated against at first have formed a big bond with him and his family, and all is well.But then something happens, Costner loses faith and then it's his turn to have a conversation with the student. You can pretty much guess the rest.It's a safe film for sure. The true story of a struggling group of sports people has been done to death, from Cool Runnings to Remember The Titans, it's a paint by numbers narrative that hasn't, and probably never will be be changed.Because it always works.Costner is fantastic as always, and although it will disappear without a trace, it's one of those films that will appear on TV one Sunday afternoon, you will come across it halfway through, watch it, and know exactly what has happened, and what will happen within a couple of minutes.It's uplifting stuff, without being too sugar coated, and you get the obligatory clip of the real life people at the end, just in case there are a few doubters in the audience.Another safe family film from Disney.I 'lapped' it up."
1397,tt2097298,6,"I had read the story of Jim White and the McFarland cross country team long before the movie came out. I was glad to see it made into a feature film, but Disney's heavy hands keep it from being fully satisfying.Most of the actors playing larger roles acquit themselves well. Yes, Kevin Costner is his overly familiar world-weary self, but there's always a certain charm in seeing him inhabit that role. Many of the young men portraying McFarland's runners are both charming and believable, and some of the quirky townspeople (such as the mother of three runners and the owner of the local variety store) add nice depth to the story.In addition, the scenery is interesting, from the running trails to the fields where the McFarland runners pick crops.One real turnoff was when, repeatedly, opposing runners were shown talking smack before the start of races, and opposing coaches made snarky comments about the McFarland team. I've coached youth sports for many years and am accustomed to seeing much better sportsmanship than that. The movie makers apparently needed to set up cartoonish villains so that the audience would root even harder for the good guys.Another clunker came at the first race, the ""Palo Alto Invitational."" The race director was surprised when McFarland showed up - but if it was an ""invitational,"" then either they'd been invited (so he shouldn't have been surprised) or they hadn't been (in which case they had no business going to the race).This was a generally pleasant two hours, and it was good to know that the basic heartwarming events took place in real life. Could have been better (or at least less bad in some parts), but it was OK. I recommend you find the story ""Running for Their Lives"" by Gary Smith, the captivating real-life tale of Jim White and McFarland (told as only the brilliant Smith could)."
1398,tt2097298,1,"OK, so I'm old, white and a native Texan. That doesn't mean I'm a bigot, racist, or stupid. I rarely go to movies anymore because I'm not interested in space creatures, zombies, excessive violence etc. I will pay to see good movies about interesting people and real life events, with good acting.McFarland definitely met my requirements and is the best movie I've seen in a very long time!When I hear my neighbors complain about Mexican immigrants and why they should be deported etc. I tell them to ""Pick your own damn lettuce then - or pay $6.00 for it!"" Most of us have no clue what their lives are like and certainly aren't tough enough to handle it.I don't remember ever seeing a Keven Costner film I thought was awful. I heard so many negative comments about Waterworld that I didn't watch it for years. Finally gave in to test it, and actually thought it was rather good. My son and his family also saw McFarland and they thought it was excellent as well. I'm very glad my teen grandchildren got to see it and hope other teens do as well."
1399,tt2097298,6,"The thought of a movie about running can be off putting, but personally I feel that you should give this movie a chance. You won't be surprised that much by what happens as the structure of it is similar to hundreds of other flicks: the typical success story of a bunch of kids you would not bet $5 on. In this case, they have the gift of running, and their trainer (Kevin Costner) is the man to lead them. By the way, after so many years, I still don't know what to think about Kevin Costner. Is he a good actor? or is he just lucky to still get some roles? I haven't got a clue, but either way, his acting will not spoil the movie. Since it's based on real events, you'll probably watch it out curiosity and forgive any lack of cinematographic quality. You should find it up-lifting and a good enough watch."
1404,tt3660770,1,"This is the latest of the DisneyNature films and it retains the finest qualities of the previous features: amazing photography, stirring music, and enjoyable narration. Ms. Fey does a brilliant job with the script -- we laughed at all the appropriate points (and there are many). But I found myself laughing at even more points because of the wonderful, comical display of macaques being macaques. There are crises as well as tender moments but the food hunting scenes were especially wonderful.If you are familiar with DisneyNature films, you know that the credits at the end are an integral part of enjoying the film. This feature is no exception. It is a rare film when I wish the credit roll were twice as long as they are, but this is one of those films. A brilliant addition to the series. It makes you proud to be part of this amazing pageant that is life on Earth. The filmmakers are deserving as much as the good causes that the film series contributes to."
1405,tt3660770,9,"Life can be tough if you weren't born to privilege. You know and understand your place in society, but wish it were higher. You try in vain to be accepted by your betters. You see no way to improve your lot in life and all you can do is watch others enjoy the fruits of their vaunted positions, and serve them. Sufficient food and shelter are hard to come by, but you make the best of the situation. You're disregarded and sometimes outright disrespected. You might not even be free to enjoy the company and comfort of the life partner of your choice. If you become a single parent, you may find yourself even more alone than when you just had yourself to be concerned with. And this whole time, you also have to worry about those outside your society taking your food, your home, your family, even your life, knowing that your only defense is those above you who treat you with such disdain. Yes, it can be really tough being a monkey in the jungles of Sri Lanka.""Monkey Kingdom"" (G, 1:20) is the eighth feature film from Disneynature and tells the story of Maya, a female toque macaque (pronounced ""muh-KAK"") who finds herself in the exact situation described above. She was born at the bottom of her group's social ladder. She has to watch her fellows in the tree branches above her eat fruits and flowers, while she is forced to scavenge what she can, including the scraps which fall to the jungle floor. She watches the other monkeys play in the tower of boulders called ""Castle Rock"", knowing that trying to interact with them would lead to an attack by her own kind. When it rains and the higher-born use Castle Rock for shelter, Maya and the other societal cellar dwellers are literally left out in the cold. When a male macaque who has struck out on his own shows an interest in Maya, he is chased off by the others. Maya is left alone and pregnant, with no choice but to fend for herself and her little boy, Kip.This being the jungle, there's even more for Maya and her fellow macaques to worry about besides the social order in their kingdom. First off, they have their natural predators to contend with. Steering clear of leopards and seven foot long monitor lizards will always be a priority, as will the search for food. Different seasons yield different edibles in varying amounts. Sometimes the monkeys have to get creative in their search for food, and sometimes (equally creatively), they just steal it from a nearby village. I suppose regular human people could be dangerous to encounter, but we see none of that here. In fact, we see the monkeys interact very amusingly with a variety of animals that are neither predator nor prey, to include an annoyed mongoose, some cute bear cubs and even an easy-going dog. Then again, there's also the danger of losing out on more than some nuts and berries. Castle Rock is prime jungle real estate and could be seen as very tempting by, say, a rival gang of macaques.I had no idea that monkeys had such a strict social order. And that's not all that surprised me. I don't want to spoil anything by describing some of the other things I saw monkeys do in this movie, because, unless you're a monkologist (yeah, I just made that up), you're likely to be surprised as well. But there's a lot more to this movie than simply an educational journey through the wilds of an island nation in the Indian Ocean. The movie features magnificent cinematography and editing, along with Tina Fey perfectly narrating a script that is accessible, interesting, clever and fun. Technically, this is a documentary, but it feels much more like a well-planned story, only you can't plan this stuff. There's real drama here, situations to which most people can relate and even a touch of a Disney princess story.""Monkey Kingdom"" is definitely not your grandparents' nature program. This movie is beautiful, thrilling, fun and educational in a way that you'll thoroughly enjoy. I had the pleasure of seeing this movie with three generations of a family with whom I am very close. The youngest member is three years old and was experiencing her very first movie in a theater. This child, who is normally very energetic (choosing my words carefully because my friends will be reading this review), was as happy and calm as I've ever seen her (awake) and, for much of the movie, she was rapt, as was her mother and grandmother, and me. Whether you're 3, 23, 43 or 93, I can hardly imagine anyone of any age not enjoying this wonderful movie. ""A"""
1406,tt3660770,1,"Every time one of these Disney Nature films comes out, my wife and I are Johnny on the spot to take our family. The last 2 we saw at the world famous El Capitan theater in Hollywood. This one we saw in the theater here. It was amazing as expected. It presented the idea of a natural order, potentially upset by the underdog. I will give you no spoils as to the outcome. I felt this movie broke away from the convention Disney has used in the past and brought us some inspiration practically applied. It's fitting that Disney, the champion of Princes and Princesses in the movies, challenges that concept. Our family liked that most about the film.For a nature film, this movie is perfect in every way. Every family with young children will love it. The incredible architecture of the fallen monument they make their home is spectacular. It's a perfect way to tell a story. I would imagine the recipe for making these things is sort of like: 1) Put cameras everywhere and shoot 2) look for what can be made into a story and 3) Make it into a story. Obviously the monkeys are not actors. Cheap labor right? Wait until the union hears about it. The monkey union? At any rate, there is love, struggle, heartbreak, and all the emotions of families trying to make it. Though the monkey's nature is a different house than ours, it doesn't take much imagination to see the connections to being a human in our society. This one's a winner. I give it 5/5."
1407,tt3660770,1,"Monkey Kingdom is a 2015 nature documentary film directed by Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill and narrated by Tina Fey. The documentary is about a family of monkeys living in ancient ruins founded in the jungles of Polonnaruwa in Sri Lanka.Maya is a toque macaque whose world is changed when her son Kip becomes part of her extended family. Maya's family has its share of diverse personalities and she wishes her son to have the best advantages for advancing within the family's social strata. When their home is overrun by a neighboring tribe of monkeys, the family has to find a new home. Maya uses her inherent smarts to lead the family to new resources, but it develops that the entire group will have to cooperate in order to reclaim their original home, where Maya wishes to advance her son's future within the family.Indeed A Terrific Movie From The Great Walt Disney Who Make Perfect Films."
1408,tt3660770,1,"Monkey Kingdom opened my mind to learning about animals in the wild! This is a great nature documentary, especially if you like monkeys and, contributions from ticket sales of this movie will help save the monkeys in south Asia. Monkey Kingdom begins with an explanation of how a certain group of monkeys live. Specifically, it focuses on Maya and her baby, who are considered the lowest of the group. It discusses their lifestyle, their routines and how they have to deal with the different seasons and the weather. They also talk about their struggle for survival. Finding food, especially for the ones at the bottom of the tree, is a challenge. These monkeys have a king and three queens. It is amazing that even though they are monkeys, they still have a social hierarchy. My favorite part of this movie is when all the monkeys are playing with each other and swinging from their homemade ""original"" jungle gym. I also like the part when the lower class runs out of food and have to find a way to survive. They locate the humans' house and raid their kitchen. They even confiscate all the eggs from the hen house!! It is hysterical to see a monkey running off with a sub sandwich.My favorite character is Kip, Maya's son! He is a cute baby monkey that is so innocent and, most of the time, has no idea what is going one. He depends on his mom for protection. Maya is on the low end of the social hierarchy. She is a female monkey with a nice personality unlike the three sister queens who act as if they own everything. I love how Maya protects her baby at all costs. Tina Fey is a wonderful narrator for this, giving a clear understanding of what is taking place.The thrust of this documentary is to raise money to help maintain the habitat of monkeys that live in the jungles of South Asia. I recommend this film for kids age 6 through 18. Both boys and girls will enjoy it because, who can resist watching monkeys play. I rate this movie a five out of five dazzling stars! Be sure to check it out when it comes out in theaters on April 17, 2015.Reviewed by Haley P., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic. For more reviews by kids, go to kidsfirst dot org."
1409,tt3660770,8,"I'm not really into Disney nature documentaries. I've seen a few they did in the 1960s on The Wonderful World of Disney, but the new ones they put out don't last in the theaters long enough for me to catch (Although I think I saw the one about the chimpanzees, and the one about elephants) This one is a lot different from the old docs 50 years ago. It's very playful with the narrative and tells a more linear story voiced by Tiny Fey. What's most interesting about this is how the plot follows the Disney formula of a true underdog coming up. They must have had to do a lot of research and follow these monkeys for a long period of time to pull that off.The story is about a single mother named Mya who's on the very bottom of the social status and must beat the odds in order to provide a better life for her son, kip.It was so fascinating to see how the Monkey kingdom mimics the kingdom of man. Whenever someone tries to convince me that we are better than other animals (cause sometimes man forgets that's what we are). I'll have this movie to use as an example of how that's not accurate.I went into this film not thinking much of anything but killing time, but it was not a waste of time. It was great!"
1410,tt1964418,9,"I'll keep this relatively short. I'm a 60 year old, very hard to please Brit. This film, pleased me very much indeed. Hence, the 9 out of 10 score. Those who marked this film down, really do require a reality check. I'm not usually given to writing film reviews, but on seeing this film's current low rating - I felt compelled to write something positive, in its favour. The acting and special effects alone, stand on their own. The film, may well be 105 minutes long, but it's 105 of the best spent minutes I've had, this millennium. I won't delve into the film's storyline, as that has been adequately explained by others. If you want to be engagingly captivated, in a futuristic, make-believe World - where anything seems possible - then this is the film for you. I for one, would love to escape the current mess of a World we live in - to experience the alternative dimension, on offer, in Tomorrowland: A World Beyond"
1411,tt1964418,8,"In an age of dark, grim visions of the future Disney's Tomorrowland is a delightful throwback to upbeat adventures of the 60s and 80s, a retro sci-fi film for the whole family to enjoy.Casey Newton (Britt Robertson) is a bright and optimistic high school student who does not share the pessimistic views of elders. When Casey discovers a mysterious pin that shows her fantastic world and sets out to find the futuristic city with the help of a jaded inventor, Frank Walker (George Clooney) and Athena (Raffey Cassidy), an English-accented Audio-Animatronics.Tomorrowland is a deliberately old-fashioned film both its tone and visuals: the film was loosely based on the Disney ride of the same name - considering that Disney were able to turn Pirates of the Caribbean into a billion dollar film series. Bird was a wise choice to direct and co-write, The Incredibles had a 60s style sci-fi look to it and he brought that look to Tomorrowland. It was bright and colourful with its showing of various technologies, from robots, jetpacks, lasers and a steampunk rocket.Brad Bird has already shown himself to be a capable action director with Mission Impossible: Ghost Portrayal and with Tomorrowland he had much better CGI. There are some cool fight sequences, especially with Athena - it is awesome to see a little girl beating up fully grown men and giant robots. Tomorrowland is visually spectacular especially when we get to see the city in all its glory for the first time. Bird certainly brought out a sense of awe, whimsy and wonder.Tomorrowland also has a great trio in the leads: Clooney, Robertson and Cassidy are terrific together, having many witty moments together when they are travelling and there is a zip in their interactions, like when they use a knock-out tool. Although Robertson's look too old to be a high schooler she pushes off the necessary enthusiasm. But it was Cassidy who stole the show: she was a revelation as Athena, playing a character who was older than she actually looked and at times acts a Terminator. She personally reminded me of Saoirse Ronan when she was younger, just with dark hair.Although Tomorrowland had a talented director at the helm it also had a screenplay with Damon Lindelof's fingerprints, a man who has poor reputation as a screenwriter. As an adventure Tomorrowland is excellent but when it goes to the science fiction the film gets bogged down with mumbo-jumbo about time particles and destiny. This part needed to be expanded and more refined. When it's revealed that Tomorrowland was a place for exceptional people to come to where they would not disrupted by government or civil society. Essentially this is similar to Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged, a controversial sci-fi work that abdicates the philosophy of Objectivism, or if you prefer it's the ideology of Andrew Ryan in Bioshock. The prologue at the 1964 World's Fair could have been cut and it would have made the reveals more impactful.Tomorrowland is a good of romp of a film, providing plenty of laughs, action and visual spectcle. It was rated a 12A in the UK but it is on lower scale of that rating and could easily be enjoyed by children younger than that age."
1412,tt1964418,1,"I very rarely write reviews for movies, but after watching Tomorrowland I've never seen a movie that's been so unfairly maligned by negative reviews,especially considering that this movie was an absolute joy from beginning to end. After watching it, and reading truly horrible, reviews I'm starting to think that somebody hired a few live bodies to slate this movie for their own specific reasons. The script, actors and directors captured the feeling of endless possibilities perfectly. The FX were fantastic, there were no lulls in the plot, George Clooney did his thing perfectly, the child actors were incredible, and there were just enough twists and turns to maintain the pace.Please, please watch this movie and make your own mind up - the negative reviews almost put me off, but I'm so glad I actually took the chance. Actually there's one proviso here - and is probably something consistent with most of the negative reviews: If you lack imagination, or the yearning for a better world, then you'll hate this movie. Or you want to raise kids who aspire to be nothing more than reality TV actors. Or if you're a reality TV actor. Or your kids can't read or write because you don't think it's important. Or if you think science is dumb. Or if you can't embrace hope.As for me...I loved it. I'll be watching it again and again :-)One of the best movies of 2015, and now on my ""favourite movie"" list."
1413,tt1964418,1,"This film deserved so much more than what it got, both critically and commercially, when it debuted back in May, where unfortunately it ended up becoming one of the year's biggest box-office bombs. From the mind of one of today's greatest directors, Brad Bird, the same great filmmaker that gave us some of the best animated films of all-time like 'The Iron Giant' and 'The Incredibles' and the best 'Mission Impossible' film to date in 'Ghost Protocol', 'Tomorrowland' is an inspiring original story that above all promotes the two things that have been lacking in today's cynical society; hope and the promise of a bright future.Some have accused this film of being preachy for promoting these exact morals. But if you ask me, that just makes this film even stronger as a result in how it boldly goes against the cynical mindset that you see a lot of nowadays in favor of an optimistic vision of a better tomorrow.Bird and co-writer Damon Lindelof make the right decision to not over-rely too much on the world of Tomorrowland. This film may be centered around a fantastic utopia where anything is possible but it's more about the journey to Tomorrowland than the place itself and the build-up leading into the film's finale is second to none. Ultimately though it was the finale of the film that made it such a polarizing flick amongst critics. But contrary to popular opinion, I thought it was suitable for what the story demanded. In a year where characters like Furiosa are being regarded as some of the greatest film characters of their time, this film features two of the best female leads of the year, played perfectly by Britt Robertson and Raffey Cassidy, respectively. As lead Casey, Robertson perfectly conveys the character's optimistic outlook without coming off as annoying while Cassidy shines in the role of the totally bad-ass robot Athena. George Clooney is also excellent in the role of an inventor named Frank who, compared to Casey, is much more pessimistic about the future but gradually regains his faith over the course of the film. Don't let this film become one of those forgotten box-office bombs just because it dared to critique the cynicism of today's society. With brilliant performances and visuals and messages that resonate more than ever nowadays, 'Tomorrowland' is easily the most underrated film of 2015 and another masterpiece from director Brad Bird."
1414,tt1964418,9,"I can't believe the bad reviews. I also can't believe that nobody understood what they accomplished with this film. It's Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged! They managed to take that book and bring it up to date while making it accessible to all ages. That is a fantastic feat in and of itself. To also make it really entertaining is extraordinary. Cerebral and action packed, it holds the attention of the young right to the end. And the end? The film was the pin that showed the audience what could be if only we don't give up and just make things better. Atlas Shrugged and then asked for help. Everybody should see this film. Now. Oh, ignore the comments about continuity. Does it really matter? Artistic licence anyone? Right my review is over but I have to keep writing because it won't post unless I fill the minimum line count."
1415,tt1964418,8,"This movie really took a person's imagination to a whole new level.The story was interesting, and keeps a person engaged with what is happening. It was cool to see the power of imagination and how a simple thought could become something much bigger.Frank Walker, played by George Clooney, was recognized by his limitless imaginative capability. It was going to one day change the world as it is. He was able to do just that. Walker was a genius scientist who made a certain discovery about Tomorrowland that would hold the key to changing the world. With the help from Casey Newton, played by Britt Robertson, Walker was able to travel to the city and unravel what he had discovered so long ago.This movie has a simple story, and it is ideal for those with a creative and innovative imagination."
1416,tt1964418,8,A bit uneven and too long (It takes the movie about 30 minutes to really kick into gear). Otherwise I enjoyed the plot of slowly figuring out what is Tomorrowland and what's the purpose behind it all. So it's not a perfect film but a long way from the failure it's made out to be. Brad Bird doesn't disappoint.I have read quite a lot of negative comments about this movie and even its message and I find that to be slightly odd. From saying science should only concentrate on inventions instead of research to being annoyingly preachy. God forbid if a movie has a message these days and despite it having an agenda I thought the movie was fun and entertaining.I personally found the message of the movie to be pro-science and to fight the cynicism and apathy that makes it seem it's impossible to save the world from the direction we're going in. I usually feel there's no hope for the human race but I like to see movies that try to convince me otherwise and try to keep the small glimmer of hope alive.
1417,tt1964418,9,"The creativity and imagination that went into this movie is stunning. A great message about how positive and forward thinking can influence our futures and the futures of generations to come. The movie brought me back to my younger days when my imagination would make exciting dreams and made me think that anything was possible. The characters were great and the scenery and colours were spectacular. I have never written a review before on this site, but after watching this movie I was inspired and felt impelled to give my comments, if only to encourage others to watch it. I remember watching Star Trek as a child and how imaginative it was with all the communication gadgets, most of which actually exist today. I wonder if many of the items seen in this movie will one day become reality as well, perhaps not in my lifetime, but with the advancement of technology and the imaginations of the creative people at Disney, who knows! All I know is that I don't agree with the critical reviews and will always form my own opinion."
1418,tt1964418,9,"I think this movie was fantastic. You should know what you are watching and who is the target audience and have the right mindset. For example if you are watching any of the Aliens you are looking for a bit of horror, thrill and some brutality; and if you are watching Avatar you are looking a hardcore mystery and thrill. I think Brad Bird did an amazing job for its target audience. When I watched it I was not expecting brutality, hardcore action or deep mystery, I was expecting good quality soft Sci-Fi. I think it did great to keep me extremely interested throughout the movie and the message of the film and its delivery was beautiful. Talking to and reading the reviews of those who didn't like it, I think they were expecting a Sci-Fi like Aliens, or Terminator which is like eating Coffee and Cookies for lunch! You'll not enjoy it because you have the wrong expectations! It's the problem of the consumer not the product. So the bottom line is, if you are looking for a beautiful soft inspirational Sci-Fi with an amazing direction that you can watch with your kids and teenagers and re-energize the dreamer in you, go for it! :)"
1419,tt1964418,9,"I went and saw this with an open mind because of the mixed response, and I must say I had a blast.The story is unique, creative and quite compelling. It is original science fiction which we do not get too often. The film is inspired by the Disney park, but at the same time, it's more of it's own thing.It is well acted and the characters are quite likable and believable. Frank Walker is interesting, entertaining and has a sense of humor. Casey is also an interesting character. I think George Clooney and Britt Robertson portrayed their leading roles very well.The film is also quite funny at times. During this film, I think I may have laughed more than I usually do at the movies, which is saying something.I think Brad Bird did a very goo job directing. The visuals are stunning and the special effects, while mostly CGI, are impressive. The action scenes are neat and intense. There is not a single moment where I was bored with the film. It also pays a nice homage to the Sci-fi genre.The one problem I had with this film is that I was expecting a little more of the ""Tomorrowland"" place and that the story needed a little more work.Overall, this was a great film and I highly recommend it to fans of science fiction. Plus, I think it totally puts ""The Haunted Mansion"" (2003) to shame.In the end, ""Tomorowland"" may not fully realize it's potential, but it should be satisfying as a fun and intriguing Disney family sci-fi/adventure comedy thrill ride."
1420,tt2096673,1,"Oh my god. This has to be the most misunderstood Pixar film ever created.
I never realized how much hate this movie had gotten until now, but, reading through the reviews, it just isn't justified.
All of these are parents complaining about it being too intense for young children, but, this film isn't for them. I found that it reached out to a completely new audience, one that Pixar hasn't really touched upon recently, and that is pre-teens and teenagers that suffer from depression.
I am now 14 years old, and this film came out at just the right time for me, when things were taking a turn for the worst. I was going through depression and suicidal thoughts for reasons that I don't want to talk about, around the time in which this film was released. I hadn't seen a disney film in quite a long time, and my little sister really wanted to see this one.
Looking at all the generally positive feedback, I decided to go see it with her.
The opening sequence was possibly one of the best Pixar had done since Wall-E. It was beautiful and cinematic, and just adorable. Riley had some pretty gorgeous facial expressions and detailing for an animation standpoint.
As the film moved on, I started to realize how well this film related to my life, and how well riley related to me as a character. Pixar was very subtle with it, but, managed to develop Riley's character so well, with her barely being on screen.
The characters themselves were shockingly complex, especially sadness and joy. (Joy has a brilliant character design, with blue eyes and blue hair which we'll get to later.)
The main plot basically revolves around a pre-teen going into a state of depression after moving to her new home, away from her friends, her hockey team.
Depression, in my experience, isnt what it says it is. To me, it is a complete lack of any feeling whatsoever. When joy and sadness basically lose control of riley for awhile, this perfectly captured the ""what is going on inside their head"" meaning at the beginning of the film. Joy and sadness are the two most important emotions, and riley didnt have them anymore. A complete lack of emotion, a state of depression.
The rest of the film after that was enjoyable, and a certain character whom I was almost sure going to be a twist villain after that monstrosity that was 'Frozen', turned out to be my personal favorite character in the film. Everyone's had some sort of imaginative personality growing up. I had one.
It helped me cope with stress, I talked to it when I was mad about something, and whenever no one seemed to want to talk to me for whatever the reason, she was always there. That's why Bing Bong's death was just so hard to watch, because of how painfully true it is. I guarantee that 99% of the people on earth have completely forgotten about their imaginative friends growing up. The thing is, he didnt die, he was completely forgotten. When you think about it, it seems so much worse than dying. After that, joy seems to have forgotten about him as well. He isnt mentioned ever again in the movie, but, I'm kinda okay with that. If the movie forgets about him, the audience does as well, which creates an illusion.
Now, let's talk about the ending.
When riley returns home to her worried parents, she seems emotionless. Then I realized something, a slow realization that happened throughout the final scene in the film.
True happiness cannot exist without sadness.
This realization is depicted in one of the most brilliant forms ever, mixed emotions. As riley is growing up and maturing, mixed emotions become apart of her and her core memories. This symbolizes maturity and complexity as you grow up.
This film got me to open up to my parents about my depression and anxiety, and I feel like I have matured just like riley did in the film. Pixar did a brilliant job as depicting our emotions, personalities, and maturity. I love this film so much, and it changed my life."

For kids it will be a funny movie with no meaning maybe!!
But for an adult, its so true!! You lose your childhood personality you change you feel sad, i mean it literally touches my soul
Great movie for both kids and adults."
1422,tt2096673,9,"I am not normally one to write reviews, but I couldn't help reading several for this film on this site that just did't seem to understand where I think the film was supposed to be coming from.The majority of the complaints I saw were that the film was 'too depressing for a children's film', but whilst I see where they are coming from in some regards, every child who I have seen watch this film (I work in a cinema) has absolutely loved it, and laughed out loud almost constantly. They are not old enough to realise the message the film is trying to convey: that life isn't all about happiness. I applaud the attempt from Pixar to make a film that is not only hilarious in places, but is also a major comment on what life is like to be a younger teenager, transitioning through one of the most important moments of life. From a more personal perspective, why should everything we show our children gloss over the reality of life, and try to make them believe everything is rosy 24/7? Again, what this film does brilliantly through the message I took away at the end was that life will never be 100% full of happiness, but that is fine. Why does it have to be? A little bit of sadness is necessary. If a person was never sad, they would be inhumane. Overall then, I suppose my review is more of a comment on the type of film we exhibit to children, and how the Nanny-state we live in looks to protect them from most of lives inevitabilities. Either way, what can't be ignored is that this film is equal parts sad, and equal parts what I am sure will become a timeless classic in years to come."
1423,tt2096673,1,"Wtf people. I was just reading like several one reviews and how do people get a movie so wrong?! It should be pg-13? It's not for children? Are these people out of there freaking mind? For all of you who feel that it's not for children, take a look again. You severely underestimate of how much emotion a child can handle and you would be suprised. The 1 star reviews are almost laughable about how inaccurate they are. These people should be locked up in a jail for attempting to stop bringing this movie to the world. I absolutely love Inside Out, it was one of my favorite movies of 2015, and I hope you 1 Star people live your lives full of misery."
1424,tt2096673,1,"Awful music, pathetic humour, irritating characters, a preposterous concept, confusing plot points, and a boring thrill ride all mixed together. I am actually completely serious when I say Inside Out is my most hated movie of all time."
1425,tt2096673,3,"1. Out of blue, Riley get sad and upset about her parents, like, for what?
2. Joy is really annoying throughout the film, no need to mention more.
3. Riley's parents really do not care about their daughter.
The epic dinner scene: mom could have asked what happened in school with Riley alone, instead of signaling her husband to take over at the table, considering Riley already looks upset."
1426,tt2096673,3,"The plot of the story was well written but I feel that they got ""side-tracked"" with the people in the main character's mind. Some of the characters were ""over done"" in my opinion."
1427,tt2096673,2,This film is the most boring I've watched in my life.
1428,tt2096673,1,"If you'd ask me even if designed for children and.... the movies is simply bad.... simply boring and too emotional...
i mean we get it it's a movie about emotions but everything feels over done
predictable boring empty...the ending was good and a bit funny in a sence
but not enought to save from a 1 stareverything about the plot felt like it was over tought and very poorly...
from the chalanges and path and.... it simply feels like it could have bring so much better...and while i generally don't like movies of this kind and it is for children nd i took that into account
most movies of this type are for me... ""sufferable""
but this one was such a cliche was so boring such a pain to watch that i simply regred watching it at all...
boring if you'd ask me... your kids might like it maybe not but in the end of the day there are much better alternatives and...to be fair the movie does look good visually... with good animations and..... but that's more of a technological thing...whn i was a child movies weren't really like that... and that's a good aspect...
yet movies for children from my time were better.....
with better stories and u know..............................."
1429,tt2096673,2,I would usually watch a Pixar movie as most of them are quite funny so I gave this one a go & I have to say never again! It was boring from start to finish even my 4 yr old agreed but still wanted to watch it to the end..what are you doing Pixar??
