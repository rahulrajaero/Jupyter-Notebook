### This is an End-to-End Natural Language Processing Project

In this project we have worked over several technologies to for the different-different tasks.

* Data Extraction from *wiki* using ```urllib, requests ```  then parsing the html with the help of beautiful ```BeautifulSoup``` library
* Storing into our database. For this we used ```postgreSQL``` RDBMS
* Connected the RDBMS to python with the help of ```psycopg2``` library
* After going through collection of data, several ```SQL``` query has been performed to process and join the table
* Now we were ready with data to do some **Natural Language Processing** 
* Ultimately, We worked on our real problem that is to do  *Sentiment Analysis*





This Projects taught me several things not  only as a machine learning but more than that side hustle in doing an end-to-end project. Like reading the libraries actual code, writing comments, docs, etc... and more importantly *how to get things done* for example googling technique, reading others comments i.e. communications.

Still a lot to do and learn in this project. Working on the same.

<br/>
Final Analysis has been done in ```6.0 ***``` <br/>
Next time we will experiments with different-different methods.
