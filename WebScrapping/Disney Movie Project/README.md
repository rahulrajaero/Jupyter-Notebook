### This is an End-to-End Sentiment Analysis Natural Language Processing Project

This is a project done from scratch during my free time where actions from data extraction to model developemnt were perfromed. In this project we have worked over several technologies for the different-different tasks. In one line - Data of Movies were extracted from wiki, then data was strored and managed locally with the help of open-source postgresql, adn ulimately model was built. 
Here are the steps: - 

* Data Extraction from *wiki* using ```urllib, requests ```  then parsing the html with the help of beautiful ```BeautifulSoup``` library
* Storing and managing into our database locally (for this we used ```postgreSQL``` RDBMS)
* Connected the RDBMS to python with the help of ```psycopg2``` library
* After going through collection of data, several ```SQL``` query has been performed to process and join the table
* Now we were ready with data to do some **Natural Language Processing** 
* Ultimately, We worked on our real problem that is to do  *Sentiment Analysis*


This Projects taught me several things not  only as a machine learning but more than that side hustle in doing an end-to-end project. Like reading the libraries actual code and going through their docs, writing comments, documentation, etc... and more importantly *how to get things done* for example googling technique, reading others comments i.e. communications.

Still a lot to do and learn in this project. 

Thanks for your time!
